Ukrainians have lived through 1,461 days of the full-scale war. That is over 72,000 air alarms, almost 20 thousand explosions, and countless shellings. That is over 13 thousand missiles and 142 thousand drones of various types. That is more than 15,000 dead and more than 41,000 injured civilians. These are 4 years of losses and victories, pain and hope, ups and downs.
And these 4 years are absolutely enough to get rid of all illusions. There is no miracle weapon that will turn the tide of the war. Ukraine’s drones are hitting deeper and deeper into the rear of the Russian Federation, but this is not enough. And Moscow has launched its Oreshnik, but did not force the Ukrainians to surrender.

It is quite clear that there is no magic agreement that would encourage Russia to withdraw its troops and stop terror either. Because complex issues cannot be resolved in a simple way. And the negotiation track is just a way for the Russian Federation to stall for time as long as possible, to fool the West and postpone new sanctions. After all, Putin does not show any signs that he is ready for peace.
There will be no sensations
This war can no longer surprise. It has become a painful routine for both Ukrainians and the West, where the news is limited to the number of destroyed homes, energy infrastructure, and civilians killed.
There are no more sensations. At meetings with our partners, at all international forums, Ukraine cannot provide any new information. It has long been known that 20 thousand Ukrainian children were kidnapped by Russia. The scale of the Russian Federation’s terror against Ukrainian energy is also known.
Russia Launches Overnight Missile, Drone Assaults on Kyiv, Across Ukraine
Everyone knows the number of missiles the Kremlin can produce and who helps with the details very well. The scale of the shadow fleet, how Moscow continues to export its oil, parallel imports, loopholes for circumventing sanctions, real export prices for Russian oil, and what the Russians are putting into their budget are known too.
And all our partners who are truly interested in ending the war understand perfectly well what needs to be done. The only way is to put systematic pressure on Russia and provide real support to Ukraine.
Sanctions should work in such a way that Russia has no resources for new weapons and payments to its own personnel and mercenaries. This should be a strong noose around the neck of Putin’s economy, not slow knots to which they have time to adapt.
Ukraine needs weapons and missiles for air defense systems, and the systems themselves. We are grateful for the support, for the praise for the Defense Forces, for the right words and statements of intent, but this cannot stop the Russian missiles and drones that fly into our cities every day and every night.
Words do not protect against Russian artillery at the front and bombers in the sky; they cannot be used to fire on enemy equipment or personnel.
To surrender means to die.
Russia considers time to be its ally in this war. Its strategy in Ukraine is to bite off a piece (sometimes a meter) of territory at the front and terrorize the rear with cold and darkness. It is stalling negotiations and arranging hybrid attacks in NATO countries, fueling populist movements in the West, and interfering in elections.
The Kremlin is playing to exhaust everyone so that Ukrainians surrender, so that partners get tired, so that the money to support Kyiv runs out.
And no matter how exhausted we are, surrender will not bring peace. Not to us, not to Europe, not to the whole world. To understand what will happen the next day after Ukraine falls, it is enough to look at the territories that Russia occupied.
Forced mobilization of men, militarization of adolescents, erasure of children’s identities. Banning of language, eradication of culture, rewriting of history, repression of religion, confiscation of property, eviction to other regions of the Russian Federation. Torture, executions, terror.
Our experience over the past 4 years of war is shared by everyone in Ukraine. Everyone here has been to the funeral of a loved one who died at the hands of the Russians — from bombings or at the front.
We don’t need sympathy, we need action.
Everyone here spends the night in a shelter, basement, or subway during air raids. Everyone has property damaged by the strikes — whether it’s a home, a car, or an office. We know what a blackout is and how to survive with children in homes without electricity, water, and heating in the coldest winter in the last 20 years.
We know how to transfer drones, electronic warfare, and cars to the military (friends, colleagues, relatives who serve) because it is faster and easier. What “+” means in response to a message, and that the words “How are you?” often contain more love and care than an entire poem.
Now, little Ukrainians who have never seen peace and quiet in their lives are going to kindergarten. Children for whom a plane means bombing, and hum is not about a motorcycle or an old car, but about a drone that brings death.
Children for whom a thunderstorm will never be a thunderstorm, but only the sound of a missile explosion. Children who have not seen their fathers because they are at war.
So when you ask what Ukrainians have felt over these 4 years, the answer will be fatigue and pain, but not willingness to surrender. The question of surrender was not relevant for us in 2022, nor in 2023, nor in 2024, nor in 2025, and it certainly is not relevant now.
And if you ask Ukrainians what they want to tell the world, the answer will be — instead of sympathy, we need action.
Because the real end of the war, the real guarantee of peace on the continent is a weakened Russia and a strong Ukraine, which will be able to protect not only itself, but also all of Europe.

Boris Johnson’s comments on Ukraine troops ‘reckless and irresponsible,’ says Geordie Greig
Boris Johnson's call for non-combat troops from the UK and Europe to be deployed immediately to Ukraine is "reckless and irresponsible," Geordie Greig told Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.
The former prime minister said non-combat forces should be stationed in peaceful regions to send a firm message to Vladimir Putin, otherwise the Russian leader would “keep going” with the conflict.
Speaking on Sunday (22 February), The Independent editor-in-chief said of Mr Johnson's comments: "It's typical of attention-seeking stunts, which he's become known for.
"The idea that Johnson can flip a switch in Putin's mind is laughable."

Minister fails to rule out retaliation over Trump tariffs but insists it’s better to negotiate ‘behind the scenes’
The education secretary said the government would ‘hope and expect’ its preferential tariff deal with the US to continue

A Cabinet minister has refused to rule out imposing retaliatory tariffs on the US, but insisted that it is better to negotiate with Donald Trump’s administration “behind the scenes”.
Bridget Phillipson also said the government would “hope and expect” its preferential tariff deal with the US to continue after the president announced 15 per cent global tariffs in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling which struck down his previous import levies.
The latest announcement from the US president has thrown the UK’s trade strategy into disarray, with questions arising over whether or not previous deals struck with the US still stand.
Asked whether UK plans to retaliate over Mr Trump’s latest tariff threat, Ms Phillipson told Sky News: "We always stand up for what's right for Britain. And I think the prime minister demonstrated that with the approach he took around Greenland.
“But the reality is that if you want to get things done, it's better to do that behind the scenes."
Pressed on whether we could respond with our own levies, the education secretary said: "In reality, you get more done when you have serious conversations, often not in front of cameras or out there in the public, but actually behind the scenes, working closely with between governments.
"And we do have a really strong relationship with the US, that is something that is not about one president or one prime minister.
"It's about that long standing and enduring relationship that is right for our country and is right for national security, and also really important at a time when we see significant global instability that we work together on those key questions like defence.”
She insisted that discussions are ongoing with the US, saying ministers want “the best possible deal for British businesses”.
Asked about the implications of the new rate for the UK, Ms Phillipson said: “We did secure a preferential deal.
“We, through the work that the prime minister has been leading in engaging with the US government and with President Trump, we would hope and expect that to continue, but these discussions are ongoing.
“This is an evolving situation. But of course, we want to get the best possible deal for British businesses.
“I understand the uncertainty it does cause for them, but they can be assured that we will always be working to make sure they get everything that they need.”
The US president’s “reciprocal tariffs”, imposed on most of the rest of the world last April under an emergency powers law were overturned by the US Supreme Court on Friday in a major blow to the president’s economic agenda.
On Friday, Mr Trump said he would replace the tariffs axed by the court with a 10 per cent tax on all goods entering the US. But in a post on Truth Social on Saturday he announced plans to increase this to 15 per cent.
But he doubled down on imposing levies following the decision, claiming the court “has been swayed by foreign interests” and other countries were “dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long, that I can assure you”.
The UK previously received the lowest tariff rate of 10 per cent, and a subsequent deal struck by Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Trump saw further carve-outs for Britain’s steel industry and car manufacturers.
But the US president’s latest tariff announcements raise questions over whether those deals still stand.
Officials are currently understood to believe it will not impact on most of Britain’s trade with America, including preferential deals on steel, cars and pharmaceuticals.
A UK government spokesperson said on Friday: “This is a matter for the US to determine but we will continue to support UK businesses as further details are announced.
“Under any scenario, we expect our privileged trading position with the US to continue and will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world.”

Dozens Wounded, 1 Dead In Russian 'Terrorist Attack' On Lviv As Missiles Pound Ukraine

A police officer was killed and dozens of other people were wounded after two blasts in Ukraine's major western city of Lviv, described by the authorities as a "terrorist act."
Early on February 22, Ukraine's national police said that an emergency call had been made shortly after midnight reporting a break-in at a local store.
It added that after a patrol unit arrived at the scene, an explosion occurred and was followed by a subsequent explosion when a second unit arrived.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram.
Police said the blasts killed 23-year-old patrol officer Viktoriya Shpylka, who began working in the region in 2023 and married another patrol officer in autumn 2025.
At least 25 other people were injured in the incident. Speaking in a televised interview, Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said three people were in "critical" condition.
Olha Pidcerkovna, an ER doctor at the local hospital, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service that these three people were placed on ventilators.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the incident a "terrorist attack" and said police had detained a suspect. He did not provide further details.
Klymenko added that further "operational measures and investigative actions" were ongoing: "Authorities are identifying other individuals involved in committing this crime."
"Police officers respond to calls every day and night, never knowing what awaits them. But they rush to help because protecting people is their primary duty," he wrote on Telegram.
Russia Attacks Ukraine With 50 Missiles
Meanwhile, the Russian military launched 50 missile and 297 drones in overnight attacks against Ukraine, the country's air force said on February 22.
Zelenskyy said seven regions were struck, adding attacks on the Kyiv region killed one person and injured eight others, including a child.
According to rescuers, those injured were pulled from under the rubble following the attack, while one man died from his injuries on the way to the hospital.
"The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway," Zelenskyy wrote on X.
Ukraine's power grid operator Ukrenergo reported Russian attacks have again prompted emergency power outages in a number of regions, including the capital.
Amid unusually cold winter temperatures, Russia has repeatedly hit power and heating facilities in Kyiv and throughout the country, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm and go about their lives.
The strikes came days after the latest round of US-brokered peace talks in Geneva ended with no breakthrough to end the Russian invasion, which on February 24 will reach the four-year mark.
While a new round of talks might happen again in the near future, Zelenskyy said that by massively attacking Ukraine Moscow continues "to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy."

St Francis of Assisi’s bones go on public display for first time
The beloved medieval friar died 800 years ago
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The bones of St Francis of Assisi, the revered medieval friar who inspired Pope Francis and generations of Christians, are going on public display for the first time.
But the month-long exhibition, organised by Franciscan friars to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the saint’s death, presents a “mixed blessing” for Assisi's Mayor Valter Stoppini and its residents.
Almost 400,000 have registered to venerate the relics; Mayor Stoppini anticipates the total could reach half a million before the bones return to their tomb on 22 March.
A dedicated force of 400 volunteers has been mobilised to guide visitors through the medieval city’s narrow, cobblestone streets to the Lower Basilica of St Francis, where the relics are housed in a bulletproof glass enclosure.
This influx will place immense strain on Assisi’s historic centre, with its confined, souvenir-lined thoroughfares and finite services.
While residents are accustomed to pilgrim surges, these are typically for shorter, more contained celebrations, making this extended period a test of local endurance.
“We’re used to this kind of event, but that lasts for one, two or three days,” Mayor Stoppini said.
“This is something prolonged, for a month, so I’m a bit worried, but calm.”
As it is, Assisi is one of the world’s most popular Christian pilgrimage destinations, located on a hill in the Umbrian countryside and built with a pink-tinged limestone that gives it its unique glow, especially at sunset.
Millions of pilgrims flock here each year thanks to the presence of St. Francis’ tomb and the spectacular basilica, decorated with Giotto’s frescoes illustrating the saint’s life, that rises over it.
St. Francis was born into a wealthy family in 1182, but renounced his wealth to live as a mendicant friar after receiving what he said was a vocation to rebuild and reform the church.
He is best known for his message of peace, his love of creation and attention to the poor -- teachings that strongly inspired Pope Francis, the first pope to name himself after the saint.
While St. Francis’ remains have been periodically inspected over the years by the Franciscan friars to ensure their conservation, this is the first time they are going on display publicly.
The decision to remove them from the crypt and welcome pilgrims for a month is a means to keep his message alive and give Christians a chance to pray before them, officials said.
Mayor Stoppini said a monthlong exhibition was the maximum he could ask of Assisi’s residents given the strain on the city that already saw a massive influx of pilgrims in 2025.
While Assisi is famous for St. Francis, a new saint is drawing a new generation of pilgrims: Carlo Acutis, who was canonised in 2025 by Pope Leo XIV as the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint.
Acutis, who died at age 15 of leukaemia, is buried in a different Assisi basilica, but his wild popularity, especially among young Latin Americans, has turned Assisi into a new religious destination for Catholic youth groups visiting Italy.
“When we go out onto the piazza, we find many people who ask us ‘Where’s Carlo? Where’s Carlo?'” said Brother Marco Moroni, the custodian of the convent of St. Francis.
Last year alone saw a 30 per cent increase in the number of pilgrims, though that was likely due to both Acutis’ canonisation and the Holy Year, which brought some 33 million pilgrims to Rome, many of whom also travelled on to Assisi.
“The beautiful thing is that saints don’t go to war against one another, thanks be to God,” he added.
“Many who come to the basilica go to see Carlo, and many who go to Carlo Acutis come to the basilica, creating an osmosis and a growing movement that does though create some problems for the city.”
For the souvenir merchants of Assisi, who make their living off religious tourists and pilgrims who flock to the picturesque town, a monthlong event is welcome.
“Other people will see what we see every day,” with Francis’ spirit imbuing the town, said shopkeeper Arianna Catarinelli, who works in a souvenir shop in the main drag of town leading to the basilica.
The shop features Assisi-emblazoned sweatshirts, pens featuring Acutis’ photo, St. Francis-themed coffee mugs and neon rosaries.
“For residents, finding parking isn’t easy. But for businesses, I think it’s positive that there are so many people,” she said.
To cope with the influx, city hall has created new parking lots outside the city center and runs a shuttle service to bring people into town.
Assisi resident Riccardo Bacconi, who works in a local bank branch, said he hoped the extra parking lots will be the legacy of the exposition that will continue to make life easier for locals.
Speaking after he went for a morning run Saturday, Mr Bacconi acknowledged the town lives from tourism and anyone who chooses to live here has to put up with it.
“I don’t judge it negatively, economically it’s important,” he said. “There are more advantages than disadvantages.”

Greenland does not need Trump’s ‘great hospital boat’, Denmark says
Greenland does not need healthcare assistance from foreign countries, Denmark's Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said Sunday after President Donald Trump announced the US was sending a "great hospital boat" to tend to the "many" sick people "not being taken care of" in the autonomous Danish territory that Trump covets.
Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries, Denmark's defence minister said Sunday, after US President Donald Trump claimed he was sending a hospital ship to the autonomous Danish territory that he covets.
"The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it's not as if there's a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland," Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
In Greenland as in Denmark access to healthcare is free. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the Nuuk hospital serving patients from all over the territory.
The Greenlandic local government signed an agreement with Copenhagen in early February to improve the treatment of Greenlandic patients in Danish hospitals.
Trump on Saturday posted on his social media platform Truth Social that "we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there".
"It's on the way!!!" he added.
WatchDanish app helps boycott of US goods and recommends EU alternatives
Trump has said the US must control Greenland to ensure its security, though he has backed off earlier threats to seize it after striking a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.
Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the hospital ship's possible arrival.
"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.
Earlier Saturday, Denmark's Arctic Command announced that it had evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention.

Gordon Ramsay brutally shut down by Charli xcx on The Graham Norton Show
Chef met his match in ‘Brat’ star on BBC series

Gordon Ramsay got a taste of his own medicine after being brutally shut down by Charli xcx during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show.
The hot-headed chef, 59, was on the BBC series to promote his new Netflix documentary, when he revealed how singer and actor Charli xcx’s hit record Brat had affected the behaviour of his daughters.
When Norton asked how Megan, 27, Holly, 26, and Tilly, 24, had channelled the energy of the anarchic album, Ramsay said they developed “attitude in abundance” as well as “loud volume”.
He added: “I think the older you get, the lower you want the volume.”
Charli xcx, real name Charlotte Aitchison, replied to the chef, known for his sweary behaviour on reality shows Hell’s Kitchen and Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares: “I mean, I feel like they could have got that from you, though, let’s be honest.”
Ramsay burst into laughter, saying: “You’re right,” with Norton quipping: “It’s been Brat kitchen, for some time.”
Brat was a worldwide success upon its release in June 2024, with the acclaim surrounding it spawning the viral cultural movement “Brat Summer”.
It garnered nine Grammy nominations, winning three, with Charli xcx winning five Brits, including songwriter of the year, album of the year, artist of the year, dance act, and song of the year for a version of her track “Guess” featuring Billie Eilish.
However, the 33-year-old star, who appears in new film The Moment, believed the album would mark the end of her career. She told Gwyneth Paltrow on the actor’s Goop podcast in November 2025: "I actually made this record being like, ‘OK, I’m just going to do this one for me. Maybe I’m going to get dropped by my label and that’s fine’. That was kind of the headspace that I was in."
Her follow-up record, the soundtrack to Emerald Fennell’s film Wuthering Heights, is currently No 1 in the album charts.
Meanwhile, Ramsay is the centre of Netflix documentary Being Gordon Ramsay, a six-part series following his family life as he opens a new restaurant in London.
Reviews have been lukewarm for the show, with The Independent's Nick Hilton criticising it for functioning largely as an advertisement for his new venture, rather than a career retrospective.
“Ramsay is one of Britain’s best telly exports, and he deserves to be making something better than his own propaganda,” Hilton wrote. “Being Gordon Ramsay is an easy watch, but it has little to say about food, little to say about the restaurant business, and little to say about the man himself.”

Geordie Greig: Labour’s SEND reforms are ‘really about money’
Bridget Phillipson speaks passionately about her desire to improve support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), but her proposed reforms are "really about money," Geordie Greig told Laura Kuennsberg on Sunday (22 February).
This week, Labour is due to publish its plans to reform the SEND system. Children will reportedly have plans setting out their right to support reviewed under changes to be set out by the education secretary.
When asked whether Ms Phillipson would be able to get her plans past Labour MPs, who have "inboxes pouring with messages from families desperately worried about the situation," The Independent editor-in-chief said: "Is she really going to guarantee that these children are not going to be left without the necessary help?
"That is a crucial question for Labour MPs who will be circling this. Are we going to see another U-turn?"

France’s Macron asks Trump to lift sanctions on European officials
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron has written to Mr Donald Trump asking his US counterpart to lift sanctions imposed on officials, including former European Union commissioner Thierry Breton.
The United States placed visa bans on Mr Breton
“The sanctions adopted against Thierry Breton undermine European regulatory autonomy and are, moreover, based on erroneous analysis: European digital regulation has no extraterritorial reach and applies without discrimination, within European territory, to all companies concerned,” Mr Macron said, according to extracts of the letter published on Feb 22 by La Tribune Dimanche.
A spokesman for the Elysee palace confirmed the letter.
Mr Macron is preparing to challenge Mr Trump over social media and free speech by making it a central priority for the French presidency of the Group of Seven in 2026. He is pushing for restrictions on children accessing social media, saying last week he will discuss the issue directly with US president.
In the letter to Mr Trump, Mr Macron also asked for the lifting of sanctions on a French magistrate over the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the nation’s former defence minister.
“The sanctions adopted against Nicolas Guillou undermine the principle of judicial independence and the mandate of the ICC,” Mr Macron said in the letter. BLOOMBERG

Russian missile and drone barrage hits Kyiv suburbs, killing 1
Russian missile and drone barrage hits Kyiv suburbs, killing 1
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia attacked Ukraine with a barrage of missiles and drones, killing one person in the Kyiv region, Ukraine’s Emergency Service said on Sunday.
Another eight people, including a child, were rescued from under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the service said.
The attack caused damage and fires to erupt in five districts in the suburbs of Kyiv. In the village of Putrivka in the Fastiv district, emergency first responders worked on saving people buried under debris.
Russia also struck energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, resulting in significant fires, which were later extinguished, the emergency service said.
During the four years since Russia launched an all-out war on its neighbor, and despite a new push over the past year in U.S.-led peace efforts, Ukrainian civilians have endured constant aerial attacks. Russia has also ramped up attacks targeting the country’s energy grid, leaving Ukrainian civilians without electricity and heating amid harsh winter conditions.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Sunday that Russia’s overnight barrage had included 297 drones and 50 missiles of various types, of which 274 drones and 33 missiles were shot down or neutralized. Of those remaining, 14 missiles and 23 drones struck 14 locations, it said. Three missiles were unaccounted for.
Separately, an explosion in Ukraine’s western city of Lviv killed one person and injured 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post on Sunday. One person has been arrested over the incident, which is unrelated to Russia’s aerial attack on Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Russian air defenses destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
A security guard was injured and a fuel tank set alight when two Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, Moscow-installed leader Leonid Pasechnik said.

Austrian climber convicted after girlfriend froze to death on Alps peak

An Austrian court has convicted mountaineer Thomas Plamberger of aggravated negligent homicide in the death of his partner, Kerstin Gärtner, who died of hypothermia after being left near the summit of Austria’s highest mountain last year.
The verdict, delivered over the weekend, brings at least a temporary close to a case that has stirred debate in the climbing community and could influence future rulings on criminal responsibility for decisions made in extreme alpine conditions.
The tragedy occurred on Jan. 18-19, 2025, on Grossglockner, which rises 3,798 meters (12,461 feet) above sea level. Prosecutors argued that Plamberger, 39, the more experienced climber who planned the ascent, acted as the “responsible guide” and committed a series of fatal errors.
According to the prosecution, Gärtner, 33, had never undertaken such a long, difficult and high-altitude winter climb. Despite harsh weather conditions, the pair continued the ascent. Grossglockner is considered one of the most challenging climbs in the Austrian Alps and requires advanced equipment, including gear suitable for glacier travel.
Prosecutors said the couple set out two hours later than recommended, did not carry sufficient emergency overnight gear and that Plamberger allowed Gärtner to wear soft snowboard boots, which are not suitable for high-altitude mixed terrain.
When they encountered winds of 74 kph (46 mph) and temperatures of −8°C (17.6°F) — with wind chill making it feel closer to −20°C (−4°F) — prosecutors argued they should have turned back. Instead, they pressed on.
By 1:30 p.m., they had passed the route’s “point of no return,” beyond which retreat becomes extremely difficult. According to the timeline presented in court, the couple became stranded around 8:50 p.m. Prosecutors said Plamberger did not call police or send a distress signal even as a helicopter circled the area around 10:50 p.m. Webcams monitoring the route captured the lights from their headlamps during the ascent.
Plamberger rejected the allegations, saying the trip was planned jointly and that both had sufficient experience and proper equipment. He said that even in the early night hours they felt strong and did not sense distress.
He testified that only close to midnight did Gärtner’s condition deteriorate dramatically, showing signs of severe exhaustion, at which point it was too late to turn back. At 12:35 a.m., they called the police station responsible for mountain rescue. His lawyer said he requested assistance, but police stated that after the call, Plamberger switched his phone to silent mode and did not answer further calls.
According to prosecutors, the pair continued upward, but about 50 meters (164 feet) below the summit Gärtner could no longer move. At around 2 a.m., Plamberger left her alone and headed to the nearest hut to seek help, without moving her to shelter from the wind, covering her with an emergency blanket or using other equipment to protect her from the cold.
By then, she was reportedly suffering from hypothermia and disorientation. Webcams captured him descending alone. It was not until 3:30 a.m. that he again contacted emergency services to report the situation. By that time, prosecutors said, Gärtner had died of hypothermia.
Given the severe winds, no helicopter could have landed on the mountain that night, meaning staying with her may have been the safer course, authorities said. Plamberger returned to the spot about six and a half hours later and found her dead.
Investigators examined the couple’s mobile phones, sports watches and photographs from the climb, which helped them conclude that Plamberger bore responsibility for her death.
The court opted not to impose the maximum sentence of up to three years in prison. Instead, it handed down a five-month suspended sentence and a fine of 9,600 euros ($10,400). In a statement to the BBC, which followed the case, the court said it took into account that Plamberger had no prior criminal record and had lost someone close to him. It also cited the intense public debate surrounding the case.
Judge Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced mountaineer who works with Tyrol mountain rescue teams, said Plamberger was an excellent climber, while Gärtner was far less experienced. He ruled that the climb should have been canceled given her limited winter experience and that Plamberger’s judgment was flawed.
However, Hofer stressed that he did not believe Plamberger abandoned her intentionally. “I do not see you as a murderer. I do not see you as a cold-hearted person,” he said.
During the trial, Plamberger’s former partner, Andrea, testified that he had left her alone during a climb on the same mountain in 2023. She said she reached her physical limit, felt dizzy and that her headlamp went out, and that she cried and screamed after he disappeared from view while walking ahead.
Judge Hofer questioned Plamberger’s claim that he left Gärtner lying on the slope, noting that rescue photographs suggested she may have fallen. According to testimony, her body was found hanging upside down from a cliff.
“We were stunned that she remained in that position,” one rescuer told the court. “If the wind had been just slightly stronger, she would have fallen over the southern slope.”
Plamberger told the court he deeply regretted what happened and said he loved Gärtner. He described her as very athletic and said they had planned the trip together.
Gärtner’s parents also testified that she had been active in mountaineering since 2020. Her mother, Gertrud, defended Plamberger before the trial, saying it angered her that her daughter was portrayed as naive.
“They always made decisions together,” she told the German newspaper Die Zeit. “If Kerstin had not agreed, they would not have gone on the climb, or her boyfriend would have gone alone. I do not want to accuse him. Many people blaming him have never been in such a situation. It is easy to be a hero from your comfortable home.”
Describing her daughter, Gertrud said: “Kerstin loved to test her limits. But above all, she was a responsible person who loved nature. For her, the mountains were not a place of recklessness but of calm, mindfulness and respect. The fact that she lost her life in the place where she felt most alive is almost incomprehensible to me. I miss her terribly.”

Number of people injured in Russian attack on Kyiv region rises to 15, one person killed
The head of the regional military administration, Mykola Kalashnyk, reported this on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
The largest number of victims was recorded in the Fastiv district. There, rescuers pulled eight people from under the rubble of a destroyed building, all of whom sustained injuries of varying severity. Five of the injured were taken to hospital. One of them died, while the others are receiving the necessary medical care.
1 / 32"Three people are in serious condition, two of them are currently in surgery, while another is receiving treatment at the trauma unit," the regional governor said.
According to him, there are also injured people in the Boryspil, Vyshhorod, Obukhiv, and Bucha districts. They were diagnosed with shrapnel wounds, cuts, fractures, smoke inhalation, and acute stress reactions. Some were hospitalized, while others received medical assistance on site or on an outpatient basis.
Rescuers, medics, police, and all necessary services continue to work at the affected locations.
"We are doing everything possible to help people and eliminate the consequences of the attack," Kalashnyk said.

Flexible EV charging pricing to cut costs and boost investment

19:14:26 KST

Türkiye's shift to flexible pricing in electric vehicle charging services is set to lower user costs, following regulatory changes adopted by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK).
Under amendments to the Electric Vehicle Charging Service Regulation, operators will be allowed to introduce dynamic pricing models aimed at encouraging consumption during off-peak hours and improving infrastructure efficiency.
The move is designed to boost competition in the EV charging market while ensuring more efficient use of existing grid capacity. A draft of the regulation had been announced on Dec. 9, 2025.
The updated framework requires operators to apply a single price for AC (slow) and DC (fast) charging units, simplifying tariff structures and making fees more transparent and comparable for users.
From July 1, all new DC charging units installed on highways and state roads will be required to integrate credit card payment systems, a step aimed at easing access and streamlining transactions.
The regulation also allows operators to offer discounts at specific hours or locations, enabling lower prices during periods of weak demand.
While a price cap is not currently on the agenda and market-based pricing remains the principle, authorities signaled that a ceiling could be considered if market stability or service continuity were threatened.
Berkan Bayram, head of the Electric and Hybrid Vehicles Association of Türkiye (TEHAD), said flexible pricing would play a decisive role as EV adoption accelerates.
Dynamic pricing is also expected to support new investments, Bayram said, noting that clearly defined regulatory frameworks tend to attract capital. Allowing operators to boost utilization during idle hours through discounts and campaigns would shorten payback periods and improve returns on investment.

‘This is the final battle’: Iranian activist says campus protests signal revolution’s return
Unknown

19:11:46 KST

Protests have resumed across Iran in recent days, driven by university reopenings and traditional 40-day mourning ceremonies for those killed in earlier crackdowns, according to Iranian activist Armin Navabi.
In an interview, Navabi said the demonstrations are not yet on the same scale seen earlier this year, when millions reportedly took to the streets, but argued they show that dissent remains strong despite what he described as a “mass slaughter” by the regime. His claims about the scale of killings could not be independently verified.
Navabi said two main factors are fueling the renewed unrest. The first is the 40th-day memorial tradition, in which mourners gather to mark 40 days since a death. Such commemorations have historically served as flashpoints for fresh protests in Iran.
The second factor is the reopening of universities across the country.
“As soon as the universities opened, the students came out and they’re protesting again,” Navabi said, adding that campus demonstrations are particularly significant because they suggest what he called “the revolution is alive.”
He said students are chanting slogans in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah. According to Navabi, chants heard on campuses include “This is the final battle, Pahlavi will return” and “Long live the king.”
Navabi described the pro-Pahlavi slogans as notable given that Iranian universities have historically been associated with leftist and anti-monarchy activism. During the 1979 Islamic Revolution, campuses were centers of opposition to the shah, whose father, Reza Shah, founded Iran’s first modern universities.
Now, Navabi said, many students are openly expressing pro-Western and pro-Israel views. He argued that being pro-Israel is “the norm” in Iran rather than the exception, though that assertion could not be independently confirmed.
Navabi said he remains in contact with family members and a network of activists inside Iran and continues to receive videos and updates through messaging apps.
The activist also addressed expectations among some Iranians regarding potential U.S. or Israeli military action against the Islamic Republic.
He said that after President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced support for Iranian protesters earlier this year, some opposition supporters were disappointed when no immediate action followed large-scale demonstrations.
However, he said some now believe any delay may indicate preparation for a more significant move.
“If the attacks that are coming are significant and take out the leaders of the Islamic Republic and especially the forces that are responsible for suppressing the people, then the Iranian people will have the upper hand,” Navabi said.
He specifically mentioned senior Iranian leaders and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the Basij militia as key pillars of the regime’s suppression apparatus. If those structures were weakened, he argued, protesters would return to the streets in even greater numbers.
“As soon as they notice that the regime cannot oppress them in the way that they did before, they will come out,” he said.
Navabi contended that regime change would require coordination between Iranian protesters and outside powers, with Iranians serving as “the boots on the ground” while the United States and Israel provide support.
Neither U.S. nor Israeli officials have publicly endorsed military action aimed at toppling Iran’s leadership. Tehran has repeatedly accused Washington and Jerusalem of interfering in its internal affairs, accusations both governments deny.
Despite uncertainty over whether outside intervention will occur, Navabi said he believes many Iranians remain determined to continue protesting if they sense the regime’s grip has weakened.

Hungary to block EU loan to Ukraine over Russian oil

Hungary will block a planned 90-billion-euro ($106-billion) European Union loan to Ukraine until the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline resumes, Hungary's foreign minister said.
Russian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since Jan. 27, after Ukrainian officials said a Russian drone attack damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe.
Hungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil , have accused Ukraine — without providing evidence — of deliberately holding up supplies.
Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart oil shipments. He said his government would block a massive interest-free loan the EU approved in December to help Kiev to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.
“We will not give in to this blackmail. We do not support Ukraine’s war, we will not pay for it,” Szijjártó said. “As long as Ukraine blocks the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary, Hungary will block European Union decisions that are important and favorable for Ukraine.”
Hungary's decision to block the key funding for Ukraine came two days after it suspended shipments of diesel to its embattled neighbor until oil flows through the Druzhba were resumed, and only days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Nearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Yet Hungary — an EU and NATO member — has maintained and even increased its supply of Russian oil and gas.

Germany news: New rules aim to give asylum-seeker job access
February 22, 2026What you need to know
- Germany's interior minister wants to make it easier for asylum-seekers to start working in Germany
- German director Ilker Catak has won the top film prize at the Berlinale
- SPD welcomes CDU support for social media ban for under 14s and calls for swift implementation
Read below for updates of the main headlines from Germany on Sunday, February 22:
Germany to speed up asylum-seeker access to job market
German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt says he wants to speed up the integration of asylum-seekers into the workforce.
In an interview with the Sunday edition of the tabloid Bild newspaper, he said he had drawn up an "immediate employment plan" that would allow asylum-seekers to get a job after three months in Germany.
"Anyone who comes here should be able to work — and quickly," Dobrindt said. "The best form of integration is into the world of work."
According to the report, migrants would be able to start working even if their asylum applications were still being processed.
A spokeswoman for Dobrindt told Bild that whether an asylum-seeker chose to work or not would have no influence on the outcome of their asylum claim. She added that those who did work would generally be able to keep their earnings, and that any income would be offset against social benefits received.
Asylum-seekers who have already been rejected or do not cooperate with authorities, for example by providing false information, would be excluded from the plan, the newspaper reported.
German chamber of commerce warns of rising risks in China business
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) says doing business with China comes with increasing risks, as the country expands its position in global markets.
"This presents opportunities for German companies, for example through strong technological progress and local innovation," DIHK President Peter Adrian told the German news agency dpa. "However, this is offset by growing risks, such as government intervention and unequal competitive conditions."
The warning comes ahead of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's planned trip to Beijing on Tuesday.
Last year, China was Germany's most important trading partner, with the volume of imports and exports totalling €251.8 billion ($296.6 billion), according to the latest German government data.
At the same time, German companies have complained of increasing barriers in the Chinese market.
Beijing has also restricted exports of rare earths — critical raw materials used in products such as mobile phones and electric motors.
"I am counting on the Chancellor to represent the interests of the German economy in Beijing," said Adrian, noting that the Chinese market still offers German companies opportunities when it comes to "renewable energies, the circular economy, medical technology and large infrastructure projects."
SPD calls for swift action on social media ban for kids
Germany's Social Democrats (SPD) have welcomed a decision by coalition partner the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) to ban social media for children under the age of 14.
At a party conference in Stuttgart on Saturday, the CDU passed a motion to implement a ban for the age group, as well as introduce more stringent checks for teens and fines for online platforms that fail to comply.
SPD Secretary General Tim Klüssendorf told the newspapers of the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland on Sunday that the ruling coalition should now move swiftly to make the ban a reality.
"We finally need clear rules on digital platforms. Addiction-inducing algorithms, hate, and bullying are a massive problem for our entire society and can be particularly dangerous and harmful to children and young people," he said.
The SPD has previously called for social media platforms to be banned for children under 14, and for children under 16 to only be able to access versions of platforms free from algorithm-controlled reward and recommendation systems.
Speaking to the tabloid Bild on Sunday, SPD parliamentary secretary Dirk Wiese also welcomed the CDU's support for the measure.
"Now we should work together to pass a concrete law in the German Bundestag very soon," he said.
Norway, Greece, the UK, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands are among a host of European countries discussing a similar form of ban, while the EU has increasingly moved toward supporting the principle.
Australia last year enforced a law that blocks minors under the age of 16 from having social media accounts on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Reddit.
German filmmaker wins Golden Bear at Berlinale
The Berlin International Film Festival’s top prize, the Golden Bear, has gone to the political drama "Yellow Letters," by German director Ilker Catak.
The Turkish-language film follows a married couple whose relationship is tested as it comes under extraordinary political pressure.
"Yellow Letters" was decidedly the most political of all 22 works in the main competition, an apt conclusion to an event overshadowed by political debates.

The aftermath of Pakistan’s air strikes in Afghanistan
Attacks kill civilians, deepen border dispute and prompt threat of retaliation from Kabul.
Pakistan says it has launched strikes on armed groups in Afghanistan after blaming recent suicide bombings, including attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, on fighters it says are operating from its neighbour’s territory.
Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing armed groups to use Afghan territory to stage attacks in Pakistan.
Afghanistan’s Ministry of Defence on Sunday said “dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded” when strikes hit a school and homes in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika.
Nangarhar police told the AFP news agency the bombardment started about midnight (19:30 GMT on Saturday) and hit three districts.
“Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out,” police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad said.
The Afghan Defence Ministry said it will “deliver an appropriate and calculated response” to the Pakistani strikes.
The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.
Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians from October to December, according to the United Nations mission in Afghanistan.
Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkiye, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.
The deteriorating relationship has had repercussions for people in both countries with the land border largely closed for months.

Russian barrage strikes Ukrainian infrastructure as war drags on
Kyiv has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults
Russia fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine on Sunday, crashing into energy and rail infrastructure and residential buildings, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4.00am, shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert nationwide, citing the threat of missiles.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack on social media, saying that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway.”
One man was killed and a dozen more people were wounded, among them four children, in and around Kyiv, Ukraine’s national police said.
Journalists saw rescuers sifting through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Sofiivska Borshchagivka in the Kyiv region.

Saint Francis of Assisi’s skeleton goes on public display for first time

Saint Francis of Assisi’s skeleton is going on full public display from Sunday for the first time, in a move that is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors.
Inside a nitrogen-filled plexiglass case with the Latin inscription “Corpus Sancti Francisci” (the body of Saint Francis), the remains are being shown in the Italian hillside town’s Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi.
St Francis, who died on 3 October 1226, founded the Franciscan order after renouncing his wealth and devoting his life to the poor.
Giulio Cesareo, the director of communications for the Franciscan convent in Assisi, said he hoped the display could be “a meaningful experience” for believers and non-believers alike.
Cesareo, a Franciscan friar, said the “damaged” and “consumed” state of the bones showed that St Francis “gave himself completely” to his life’s work.
His remains, which will be on display until 22 March, were transferred to the basilica built in the saint’s honour in 1230. But it was only in 1818, after excavations carried out in utmost secrecy, that his tomb was rediscovered.
Apart from previous exhumations for inspection and scientific examination, the bones of Saint Francis have only been displayed once, in 1978, to a very limited audience and for only one day.
Usually hidden from view, the transparent case containing the relics since 1978 was brought out on Saturday from the metal coffer in which it is kept inside his stone tomb in the crypt of the basilica. The case is itself inside another bullet-proof and anti-burglary glass case.
Surveillance cameras will operate 24 hours a day for added protection of the remains.
Saint Francis is Italy’s patron saint and a public holiday is to be reinstated on 4 October to mark the 800th anniversary commemorations of his death.
Reservations to see the saint’s remains already number “almost 400,000 (people) coming from all parts of the world, with of course a clear predominance from Italy”, said Marco Moroni, the guardian of the Franciscan convent. “But we also have Brazilians, North Americans, Africans,” he added.
During this usually rather quiet time of year, the basilica usually has 1,000 visitors a day on weekdays, rising to 4,000 at weekends. The Franciscans said they were expecting this to rise to 15,000 visitors on weekdays and up to 19,000 on Saturdays and Sundays for the month-long display of the remains.
“From the very beginning, since the time of the catacombs, Christians have venerated the bones of martyrs, the relics of martyrs, and they have never really experienced it as something macabre,” Cesareo said.
Experts said the extended display of Saint Francis’s remains should not affect their state of preservation. “The display case is sealed, so there is no contact with the outside air. In reality, it remains in the same conditions as when it was in the tomb,” Cesareo said.
The light, which will remain subdued in the church, should also not have an effect. “The basilica will not be lit up like a stadium,” Cesareo said. “This is not a movie set.”

Russian missile and drone barrage hits Kyiv suburbs, killing 1
Russia launched a major overnight missile and drone attack on Ukraine, killing one person near Kyiv and damaging homes and energy sites
- Bookmark
Russia attacked Ukraine with a barrage of missiles and drones, killing one person in the Kyiv region, Ukraine's Emergency Service said on Sunday.
Another eight people, including a child, were rescued from under the rubble of destroyed buildings, the service said.
The attack caused damage and fires to erupt in five districts in the suburbs of Kyiv. In the village of Putrivka in the Fastiv district, emergency first responders worked on saving people buried under debris.
Russia also struck energy infrastructure in Ukraine's southern Odesa region, resulting in significant fires, which were later extinguished, the emergency service said.
During the four years since Russia launched an all-out war on its neighbor, and despite a new push over the past year in U.S.-led peace efforts, Ukrainian civilians have endured constant aerial attacks. Russia has also ramped up attacks targeting the country's energy grid, leaving Ukrainian civilians without electricity and heating amid harsh winter conditions.
Ukraine’s Air Force said Sunday that Russia's overnight barrage had included 297 drones and 50 missiles of various types, of which 274 drones and 33 missiles were shot down or neutralized. Of those remaining, 14 missiles and 23 drones struck 14 locations, it said. Three missiles were unaccounted for.
Separately, an explosion in Ukraine's western city of Lviv killed one person and injured 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post on Sunday. One person has been arrested over the incident, which is unrelated to Russia’s aerial attack on Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Russian air defenses destroyed 86 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said Sunday.
A security guard was injured and a fuel tank set alight when two Ukrainian drones hit an oil depot in the Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Luhansk, Moscow-installed leader Leonid Pasechnik said.

Many young people are finding themselves trapped in homelessness, unsafe conditions or relying on crisis services due to the “unfair” rental sector, charities have warned.
Vulnerable young people are being rejected by landlords due to their age, profession, lack of guarantor or connection to a homelessness service, charity EveryYouth has found.
The group organises a network of 10 youth homelessness charities across the UK. A survey of these services showed young people are mainly facing discrimination due to not having a family member who can be a guarantor (90 per cent), followed by their income level (70 per cent) despite being able to afford rent.
Kalvin, 18, said he struggled to find a landlord who would accept him, eventually leading him to a homelessness charity in Devon after a period of rough sleeping while being in work.
Originally from Glasgow, Kalvin says he moved to Devon for a “fresh start”, working for two years as an apprentice in the motor trade industry.
Although not making much – an under-18 apprentice wage in the UK is £7.55 an hour – he was making at least £1,000 a month. This would be enough for a one-bedroom flat in North Devon, at an average of £597, or to live in a house share. Despite this, Kalvin says finding a place to rent proved impossible.
He said: “There have been multiple occasions where I’d see a place I really, really liked and they wouldn’t accept me because I was too young. It was very difficult to get somewhere that I could stay and call home.
“Places say ‘you’re too young’, or ‘you get paid a certain way’ or ‘you do not get paid enough’, and they question your income. It put a lot of stress on me.”
Kalvin added he is unable to rely on family for money. Now staying in supported accommodation provided by the Amber Foundation, part of the EveryYouth network, the 18-year-old said he’s “actually now interested in college, and they’re helping me go for that”, adding he will be doing his GCSEs so he can pursue a course in IT.
From May this year, new protections will come into effect for renters as part of the Renters’ Rights Act. This will tackle discrimination by making it illegal for landlords to refuse tenants in receipt of benefits or with children, and by ensuring they give a legal reason for eviction.
But there is “real concern” that this won’t benefit young renters and could even have a knock-on effect, said Nicholas Connolly, EveryYouth CEO.
He said: “It’ll put greater obligations on landlords, and ultimately they will try harder to avoid those obligations. And there are so many ways that they can discriminate legally.
“The young people that we support have no savings, very little or zero familial support, they’ve got nothing to fall back on. The ones we support are in homelessness services, but they have to leave that at some point. There isn’t social housing for most of them.
“So the only option is the private rented sector, and unless there is some additional support that recognises that they don’t have the social or economic capital that other people in society have, they will just not be able to get anywhere to live.”
Rosie, 19, works full-time, 35 to 45 hours a week, at a pub in Hampshire. She left a “toxic and abusive” family household when she was 17 and moved into supported accommodation provided by EveryYouth partner charity, Step by Step.
When she was ready for independent living, Rosie started looking for a private rental with the help of her support worker. It took eight months for a landlord to accept her.
Rosie said: “I was consistently turned down because of my age or because Step by Step was put on my application [as my current address]. One [landlord] did outright tell me they didn’t want to take me because ‘they know what kind of people end up in Step by Step’ and other landlords beat around the bush and say, ‘We don’t think this house share is for you’.
“I have been fully employed, full-time, since I was 17. It does feel quite condescending. I can’t help the situation I’m in. Landlords should be considering how much you earn and if you can pay the rent. Instead they’re just considering the fact that I’m under the age of 20.”
EveryYouth said it is calling on the government to strengthen protections against discrimination linked to age by introducing meaningful penalties for landlords who discriminate.
At the same time, it calls for greater incentives for landlords to provide tenancies to vulnerable young people, like council-backed guarantors or deposit help schemes, which could help them leave supported or temporary accommodation faster.
A spokesperson from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Discrimination against anyone based on their age is completely unacceptable.
“Through the Renters’ Rights Act we’ve already taken action to stop discrimination against people who are receiving benefits or have young children.
“We will keep action under review to extend these powers so we can make sure everyone has a safe and decent home.”

Zelenskyy: Russia struck Kyiv and seven Ukrainian oblasts overnight
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reported that nearly 300 Russian attack drones and 50 missiles targeted Kyiv and Kyiv Oblast, as well as Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava and Sumy oblasts on the night of 21-22 February.
Source: Zelenskyy on X (Twitter)
Details: Zelenskyy noted that energy infrastructure was once again the main target, and there was also damage to railway infrastructure.
Quote: "Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy.
This week alone, Russia launched more than 1,300 attack drones against Ukraine, over 1,400 guided aerial bombs, and 96 missiles of various types, including dozens of ballistic ones.
That is why we must bolster our air defence. We need systems that effectively counter ballistic threats."
Background: On the night of 21-22 February, Russian forces carried out a combined strike on critical infrastructure facilities across Ukraine. The Ukrainian Air Force recorded 345 aerial attack assets, including 33 missiles and 274 UAVs that were shot down or jammed.

Türkiye, Saudi Arabia to sign 2nd phase of 5-GW renewable energy deal at COP31

Türkiye and the Saudi Arabian company Acwa Power are set to sign the second phase of a 5-gigawatt renewable energy cooperation deal at the U.N. climate summit COP31 to be held in Antalya, Türkiye, later this year, Acwa chairman Mohammad Abunayyan said.
The planned signing would cover the remaining 3 gigawatts of capacity under a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, following this week’s deal for the first 2 gigawatts of solar projects in Türkiye's central provinces of Sivas and Karaman.
“We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,” Abunayyan told Anadolu Agency in an interview on Feb. 20 on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for the Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects.
The new phase “will be a mix between solar and wind and storage,” he added, noting that the company is also considering integrating storage into the initial 2-gigawatt solar projects.
The first phase, signed this week, is part of a broader 5-gigawatt framework agreed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 3. Abunayyan said that the construction on the 2 gigawatts of solar capacity is expected to begin next year after permits and environmental approvals are completed, with the first electricity targeted for early 2028.
“We are going to start our dispatch of the first electricity of this 2 gigawatts by the beginning of 2028, and we will be able to produce it all in 2028,” he said, describing it as a “very fast-track project.”
COP31, scheduled for Nov. 9-20 this year will be held in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, with a leaders’ summit expected in Istanbul. Nearly 200 countries are anticipated to participate in the U.N. climate talks, which are set to focus on implementing the Paris Agreement, including emissions reduction targets, adaptation efforts, climate finance and carbon market mechanisms.
Abunayyan said the first projects would deliver what he called the most competitive electricity prices in Türkiye while incorporating local content and Turkish contractors. “It will deliver the most competitive cost that you could imagine in Türkiye,” he said. “It’s going to deliver local content.”
He praised Türkiye’s renewable energy strategy, calling it “a great strategy” and “ambitious,” and noted the country’s goal to add 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2035.
“This project … is really a starting of this 80 gigawatts,” he said.
Türkiye aims to increase its total installed solar and wind capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2035, which implies adding about 80 gigawatts to current levels. To achieve that target, the country would need to install roughly 9 gigawatts of new capacity each year.

Silent suffering: how a domestic helper’s Hong Kong dream became a nightmare
Nepalese helper came to city in search of better life, only to find exploitation, exhaustion and abuse behind closed doors
Sanju*, a foreign domestic helper of Nepalese ethnicity, never imagined her Hong Kong dream would turn into a nightmare.
The 34-year-old arrived in Hong Kong in 2023, driven by a simple wish to work in the city of her dreams. But she said her first employer paid her 30 per cent below the statutory minimum wage, allowed her only two hours of sleep a day, and gave her just three rest days over six months, during which she was only paid two months’ salary.
After six months, she was dismissed and thrown out of the flat in the middle of the night because she could not speak English.
Sanju found a new employer three months later, but that was only the start of another ordeal, she said.
“I had to sleep on the floor in a small room where I could not stretch my legs. There was no fan, no air conditioning, no breakfast for me, and I was not allowed to open the window,” Sanju said through an interpreter.
Once, she bought her own food and tried to cook in the kitchen, but she said the employer told her, “It’s my gas, my kitchen,” and threw the food away.

Ukraine can counter Russian propaganda asymmetrically – expert
Liubov Tsybulska, a strategic communications expert and director of the NGO Join Ukraine, said this in an interview with Ukrinform.
"Russia has been steadily increasing its propaganda budgets over the past 12 years. They may cut spending on education or healthcare, but they will always increase expenditures on war and propaganda. Obviously, we do not have the same resources, but in reality, we do not face the same task. We must defend ourselves asymmetrically. For example, Russia has powerful aviation, but then the Security Service of Ukraine appears with Operation Spiderweb and small, cheap drones destroy more than 30% of Russian missile carriers. This is exactly what we must do – and are doing – in the information sphere as well," she said.
Tsybulska noted that Ukrainians working in the field of information warfare are more motivated because the issue concerns survival.
"The Russian propaganda machine operates only thanks to the use of enormous resources," she added.
Earlier reports said that Russia's state budget spending on state television channels in 2026 would reach 106.4 billion rubles (about $1.27 billion), which is 54% higher than previously planned and exceeds this year's figures.

14 Muslim nations slam US envoy's Israeli land rights claims

Fourteen Muslim-majority countries and three regional organizations condemned Sunday remarks by Mike Huckabee, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, after he said it would be acceptable for Israel to exert control over territory belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministries of Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Palestine, Qatar, Oman, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates expressed "strong condemnation and profound concern" over the comments.
The statement was also issued with the participation of the secretariats of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the League of Arab States, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The ministries described the U.S. envoy’s remarks as "dangerous and inflammatory," saying they constitute "a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations" and pose a grave threat to regional security and stability.
They said the comments directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump and the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, which is based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state.
The signatories said "the plan is grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence," warning that attempts "to legitimize control over the lands of others undermine these objectives, fuel tensions," and amount to incitement rather than advancing peace.
The ministries "reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands," the statement noted.
"They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states," it added.
The statement warned that "the continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine prospects for peace."
The signatories called for an end to what they termed "incendiary statements" and reiterated their "commitment to the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state" along the June 4, 1967, lines, as well as to ending the occupation of all Arab lands.
Mike Huckabee, named U.S. ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a "divine right" for Israel in the West Bank.
He argued that Israel has a "biblical right" to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all."
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with U.S. journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of "divine providence" giving control of the region to Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels "very attached" to the vision of a Greater Israel.
He said he considers himself "on a historic and spiritual mission," including "generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us."
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Trump questioning why Iran has not 'capitulated' yet

The number of Palestinians killed by Israel's military onslaught on the Gaza Strip has risen to 72,072 fatalities since October 2023, medical sources told the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
The number of those injured has also risen to 171,741.
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not "capitulated" in the face of Washington's military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
In a Fox News interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was "curious" about Iran's position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why they haven't capitulated," he said.
"Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."
Witkoff's comments came after the United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings.
Iran has been under threat of a US military attacks over the months, in response to the crackdown on anti-government protesters and a lack of agreement to a nuclear deal.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Israel continued to violate the ceasefire which came into effect on 10 October.
Israeli warplanes targeted the eastern areas of Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, while army vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis.
In Gaza City, Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes on the eastern areas, coinciding with sporadic artillery shelling of the same areas. This also comes as Palestinians in the enclave observe the holy month of Ramadan - their third under Israeli war.
The number of Palestinians killed by Israel's military onslaught on the Gaza Strip has risen to 72,072 fatalities since October 2023, medical sources told the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
The number of those injured has also risen to 171,741.
Iran and the US have differing views over the scope and mechanism to lift sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday, adding that renewed talks were scheduled in early March and could possibly lead to an interim deal.
Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham is urging US President Donald Trump to go ahead with military strikes on Iran, and warning against advisers counselling restraint against the country, the US website Axios reported on Sunday.
"I understand concerns about major military operations in the Middle East given past entanglements. However, the voices who counsel against getting entangled seem to ignore the consequences of letting evil go unchecked," he told the outlet.
The remarks come as two US aircraft careers and hundreds of warplanes are positioned in the region, and Trump has been presented with military options that include targeting Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and his son, Mojtaba.
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not "capitulated" in the face of Washington's military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
In a Fox News interview with Trump's daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was "curious" about Iran's position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.

Witkoff's comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days.
Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
Israeli forces detained eight Palestinians, including three children, during a predawn raid on Sunday in the West Bank city of Qalqilya and town of Azzun, Palestinian media reported.
According to local sources, Israeli forces stormed Qalqilya from its eastern entrance, raided and searched several homes, before detaining Aboud Nawfal, Amir Khader, Adham Oweinat, Amr Helal, and Mazen Abu Al-Sheikh.
Israeli forces then stormed Azzun, where they raided the home of Ahmad Rashad Salim, and detained his three children—Yahya, Yaqoub, and Rashad—after assaulting him before releasing him while keeping his children in detention.

Speaker: Anti-terror panel's report marks 'vital threshold'

Parliament Speaker Numan Kurtulmuş on Feb. 21 described the delivery of a final report by a commission overseeing the government’s anti-terror project as a "vital threshold."
"This report is certainly not everything, but it is a milestone for what needs to be done next. Within this framework, the necessary steps must be pursued with good faith, patience and determination," Kurtulmuş told journalists during a gathering in Istanbul.
The National Solidarity, Brotherhood and Democracy Commission concluded its work on Feb. 18, presenting a 60-page final report outlining proposed “democratization” steps and legal reforms under the government’s “terror-free Türkiye” initiative.
"From now on, political parties will come together to discuss what can be done, especially regarding legal regulations. Ultimately, I hope that regulations that all parties will sign off on will be implemented," Kurtulmuş said. "This was a vital threshold for Türkiye, and we have crossed it. This doesn't mean everything is over. A period of intensive work is needed."
Momentum behind the initiative increased after jailed PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan issued a call that prompted the terror group to begin disarming. A first batch of members publicly destroyed weapons in July, and PKK later announced it would withdraw from Turkish territory in October.
The İYİ (Good) Party remains the only major political party boycotting the initiative and declined to send representatives to the commission.

‘A global hero’: Jesse Jackson’s legacy of activism around the world

When Jesse Jackson called for the Democratic party platform to include Palestinian statehood, the pushback was fierce. “While we had strong support from delegates at the convention, there was still a fear factor that the issue couldn’t be discussed,” recalls James Zogby, who was deputy manager of Jackson’s presidential campaign. “I was told by the [nominee Michael] Dukakis negotiators, if you even say the P-word, you’ll destroy the Democratic party.”
Jackson’s effort did not succeed at the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. But 10 Democratic state parties had already passed resolutions in favour of Palestinian self-determination. And as the decades rolled by, more and more progressives came to share Jackson’s stance. Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute, reflects: “He was way ahead of the base. Even the activists who supported Palestinians did not have the same depth of understanding.”
When Jackson died on Tuesday at the age of 84, many tributes understandably focused on his contribution to the domestic civil rights struggle and how he bridged generations between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. But perhaps uniquely for a non-president, his passing was also mourned around the world, from Havana to Johannesburg to Ramallah.
Jackson was a man ahead of his time who blazed a trail for the progressives of today. He was a true internationalist, a trenchant critic of US imperialism and believer in the solidarity of oppressed people everywhere. He was an advocate of normalising relations with Cuba, a scourge of racial apartheid in South Africa and a prominent voice for Palestinian rights. He also embarked on missions to Syria, Iraq and Serbia to free US prisoners.
Martha Biondi, a professor of Black studies and of history at Northwestern University, said: “Jesse Jackson is described typically as a civil rights leader, as somebody who helped pave the way for the election of Barack Obama, and, while all of that is true, in some ways it’s more helpful and illuminating to see Jesse Jackson as one of the most prominent figures of the American left in the 20th century and into the 21st century.
“In that sense, he paved the way not only for Barack Obama but he was a precursor to Bernie Sanders. He’s very much in that very progressive, economic, populist mould. If you see him in that light, then it’s not confusing that he was an early advocate of Palestinian rights.”
When Andrew Young, the US ambassador to the United Nations, was forced from his post in 1979, the row reverberated far beyond Washington. Young had held a clandestine meeting with a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) – then regarded by the US government as beyond the pale. Under intense pressure, he resigned.
Among Young’s most ardent champions was Jackson. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy, Jackson led a delegation to the Middle East, where he met Israeli officials as well as figures from the PLO, including its leader, Yasser Arafat.
Jackson argued that Washington should abandon its policy of isolation and negotiate directly with the organisation. At the same time, he drew careful – if unmistakable – parallels between the Palestinian cause and the African American struggle. “We understand the cycle of terror, the cycle of pain,” he said.
Sam Klug, an assistant teaching professor of history at Loyola University, Maryland, noted: “He said, when he was visiting essentially a Palestinian refugee camp outside Beirut, that it reminded him of some of the conditions that he had grown up in under Jim Crow. It was clear that he saw a link between his work in the civil rights movement, his work against racial oppression in the United States and his support for the Palestinian people.”
Some Jewish people in the US were appalled by Jackson’s embrace of Arafat. But he played a vital role in mainstreaming the Palestinian cause among African American leaders, shifting the perspective from a purely nationalistic dispute to a profound issue of human rights.
For Zogby, it was about humanity and bridging the gap between the established civil rights movement and the anti-colonial liberation struggles of the global south. He said: “Watching him in the West Bank or Egypt or Kuwait, he was as comfortable with people there as he was in Chicago.
“It was because he didn’t look down on Arabs. He saw himself as part of a global community. It was a third world mindset. We’re people of colour. We have human needs. These were one struggle, one fight, and he was part of it and he saw himself in that context. South Africa obviously fed into that.”
Omar Barghouti, a co-founder of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian rights, said in an email: “Palestinians have eulogized this towering Black American leader’s departure with grief and with profound appreciation for his exceptional role in catapulting Palestinian liberation into the US mainstream political discourse when hardly any politician dared to.
“Building on Dr Martin Luther King’s late-life intersectional call for resisting the ‘triple evils of racism, economic exploitation and militarism’, Rev Jackson believed that freedom for the Palestinian people must be part of that global resistance. Despite the obvious differences, his advocacy for Palestinian rights must be seen in the context of a decades-long tradition of Black-Palestinian mutual solidarity, from Malcolm X to Angela Davis.”
Jackson first travelled to South Africa in July 1979, two years after the death of Black consciousness founder Steve Biko. He drew massive crowds at rallies in Soweto, a township near Johannesburg. In 1984 he was the most prominent presidential candidate to voice support for the imprisoned Nelson Mandela; his two White House campaigns gave him a platform to amplify the message.
When Ronald Reagan was moving US policy sharply to the right and giving the apartheid regime in South Africa a new lease on life, Jackson provided a clarion call to conscience. He vigorously pushed for sanctions against the apartheid state, characterising it as a moral disgrace rather than a mere pawn in the cold war. His relentless organising and voter mobilisation helped pressure Congress to overturn Reagan’s veto and pass historic anti-apartheid sanctions in 1986.
Jackson was motivated by parallels with the fight for racial justice in the US. He wrote in the Guardian in 2013: “As a young civil rights activist, I knew how raw and ugly and violent the apartheid regime was. They were being jailed, we were being jailed. We were being killed, and they were being massacred.”
William Gumede, 55, founder and executive chairperson of the Democracy Works Foundation in South Africa, recalled: “Jesse Jackson stood out as a beacon because the perception in the 1980s was the US government of the time was much more in favour of protecting the apartheid government. That made Jesse Jackson, in our eyes in South Africa, an important larger-than-life hero of the anti-apartheid movement.”
Jackson was a Black man with global interests and global reach, noted Gumede, an associate professor at Wits University in Johannesburg. “The kind of heroes that we would have would be dealing with our issues. He was dealing with his issues and many other world issues and that made him an extraordinary person.
“In the 80s and the anti-apartheid movement, there was a lot of focus, particularly in my generation, with looking at people through colour lenses and looking around the world for Black heroes. He was a Black hero in the US but he was also a global hero in not only Black issues but many other issues beyond race.”
Barbara Masekela, 84, a South African poet, educator, diplomat and anti-apartheid activist, added: “For me the most remarkable thing was that he was one of the first Black activists to link the struggles of people all over the world, including South Africa.
“We come from a generation that had a lot of innovative thoughts about human rights all over the world. We are also a generation that benefited from the explosion of information. He was one of the few activists that took advantage of that knowledge and continued the line of solidarity between African populations all over the world. He cared about the soul of Black folks.”
Jackson routinely criticised US military interventions and the financing of rightwing counterinsurgencies in countries such as Nicaragua and Angola, calling instead for diplomacy and equitable economic development in the global south.
But perhaps Jackson’s greatest international achievements were the hostage and political prisoner negotiations that he successfully conducted, often with countries that the US declared enemies and therefore refused to do business with. These included Syria (freeing navy lieutenant Robert Goodman), Cuba (freeing 48 political prisoners), Iraq (freeing hostages before the Gulf war) and Serbia (freeing three US soldiers).
David Masciotra, author of I Am Somebody: Why Jesse Jackson Matters, notes that after the successful mission to Syria, Jackson was invited by Reagan to the White House. “Reagan asked Jackson, ‘What can I do for you in return?’ Jackson said, ‘I want you to get on the phone and call [Syrian president Hafez al-]Assad and thank him.
“Reagan said, ‘Well, we have a no-talk policy with Syria.’ Jackson said, ‘Yeah, I know, and that’s why that’s what I’m asking you to do; I want you to break that policy.’ To his credit, Reagan did it, and Reagan and Assad spoke for the rest of his administration. Jackson was a believer in diplomacy and cooperation and democracy promotion through conversation, as simple as it sounds, rather than aggression and other forms of brinkmanship.”
It was a worldview shaped by Jackson’s own experience growing up Black in America. Masciotra added: “He said that’s how he learned to become a good negotiator because growing up in the Jim Crow south as a poor Black man, every day was a negotiation and his life was at stake. He had a life that was formed by pain very early on and he identified with the pain of others and those who were despised and demeaned and he sought to speak for them.
“Being an American icon gave him a credibility with these regimes in which he could speak to them as an American but also as an American who could relate to their experience with American policy. He was a victim of a certain kind of domestic form of colonialism, so therefore he could relate to countries that had suffered from colonialism beyond American shores.
“It was connecting with those people on a very deep personal level because of the source of their pain but it was also connecting politically because he could say, ‘I’m an American but I’m very well acquainted with the dark side of the American experience and that’s something that you know about too; you’re just going about your resistance the wrong way by taking hostages and political prisoners.’”
More than four decades since the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, many of Jackson’s policy positions have aged well and into the centre-left consensus. Yet as he neared the sunset of his life, he was the first to recognise that the struggle was far from over. At the 2024 convention in Chicago, the party explicitly refused to allow a Palestinian American speaker on stage amid the devastating war in Gaza.
Earlier that year, again in Chicago, Zogby had attended a summit at Jackson’s Rainbow Push Coalition. He recalled: “As I left at the end of the summit, I went over to him and I said, ‘Reverend, I’m going to go,’ and he just looked at me and he said, ‘Remember the babies. They’re dying every day. Do something.’
“Gaza moved him and, even that early in January 2024, he got it. By the time we got to the convention, he wasn’t able to speak, but I’m fully confident of the fact that he would have said: let Palestinian voices be heard.”

‘I’m going to fight’: freed Venezuelan activist on life after Maduro’s downfall

Jesús Armas was asleep inside Venezuela’s most infamous political prison at the start of January when a thunderous explosion and a blackout announced the start of a new era.
The activist remembers roars of excitement rippling through the jail’s cells as befuddled guards scurried around “like something really big was happening”. Prisoners began to belt out Venezuela’s national anthem, a stirring battle cry against tyranny: “Glory to the brave people! … Down with the chains! … Death to oppression!”
Armas and his fellow inmates had no idea what had caused the pre-dawn commotion on 3 January, although some suspected it was connected to the United States.
Only three days later, during a rare family visit, did the 39-year-old learn that Venezuela’s authoritarian president, Nicolás Maduro, had been captured during a nocturnal assault ordered by Donald Trump.
“In that moment I realised … we had a real opportunity to have a transition to democracy,” Armas said last week after being allowed to leave the El Helicoide prison after 14 months – one of more than 440 political prisoners freed after Maduro’s demise.
Four days after his release, Armas was still trying to comprehend the most startling twist in Venezuela’s turbulent recent history and how it might shape the country’s future.
“It’s weird,” he said, while preparing to head to the latest pro-democracy protest since Maduro’s downfall. “We are not totally in a transition, but I think we are a few steps in that direction.”
Just two months earlier, at the denouement of Maduro’s increasingly despotic rule, such displays of public defiance were inconceivable and would probably have been crushed by security forces. In 2024, more than 2,400 people – including Armas, who was abducted and tortured by men with machine guns – were imprisoned as Venezuela’s dictator tried to silence claims he had stolen the presidential election.
But since Maduro’s removal the mood has shifted, with one recent poll showing a surge in optimism among Venezuelans after years of repression, privation and despair. Last week, Armas was one of thousands of mostly young demonstrators who gathered in cities across Venezuela to demand a full transition to democracy and the complete emptying of political jails.
“I have the right to be in the streets and that’s why I’m here,” said María Fernández, 21, who joined a rally on the palm-dotted campus of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV).
Agustín González, a 20-year-old law student, said he was marching because he wanted neither “imperialist tutelage nor continued authoritarianism” for his homeland.
The fact that Venezuela’s return to democracy was not fully sealed by Maduro’s toppling is explained by the fact that his vice-president, a UCV alumna called Delcy Rodríguez, took the reins immediately after his departure. Trump officials concluded that leaving Venezuela in Rodríguez’s hands, rather than installing the Nobel-winning opposition leader, María Corina Machado, was the best way to avoid violence – and secure access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – after its surgical strike on Maduro’s military base.
“Delcy has done a very, very good job and the relationship is strong. The oil is coming out and a lot of money is being made,” Trump said on Friday after his energy secretary, Chris Wright, flew to Caracas – the most senior US official to do so in years.
Six weeks after Maduro’s abduction, Rodríguez remains in power – as do many of his regime’s key figures, including the interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, and the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López. Last week, in a rare interview with NBC News, Rodríguez insisted free and fair elections would “absolutely” be held – but declined to say when. Her brother, the national assembly chief, Jorge Rodríguez, dashed hopes a vote might be held in the “immediate” future.
Armas understands better than most the bewildering disconnect between the unquestionable changes brought about by Maduro’s overthrow and the simultaneous maintenance of Venezuela’s undemocratic status quo.
On 8 February, he remembers El Helicoide’s director approaching him with news that his prison nightmare was over: “Jesús, come with me … you’re getting out.”
A few hours later intelligence agents were driving Armas to his family home to see his 90-year-old father, who he feared might die while he was incarcerated. “He didn’t say anything. He just cried,” the opposition leader recalled of their first hug in months.
Soon after, Armas was cruising through Caracas’s streets in a convoy of motorbikes alongside colleagues including Juan Pablo Guanipa, a well-known opposition politician who had also just been released. “It was amazing … People were screaming [with] excitement,” he said.
The elation was shortlived. As night fell, a group of armed heavies grabbed Guanipa and disappeared with him before he reappeared under house arrest, wearing an ankle tag. “I was in shock,” said Armas, who immediately grasped the limits of Venezuela’s incipient political thaw. “I thought: ‘OK, if this is happening to Juan Pablo, it’s going to happen to me too.’”
Armas suspected senior officials had been spooked by the outpouring of emotion prompted by Guanipa’s release and feared demands for democracy might spiral out of control if a ceiling was not set.
“They must be worried this could grow as people lose their fear … that this could be like a snowball that will grow and grow and grow,” said the activist, who returned to Caracas to continue his political struggle in 2021 after a spell studying at the University of Bristol as a recipient of the UK’s Chevening scholarship and living in London.
Armas believed regime efforts to thwart a South American glasnost by targeting figures such as Guanipa, who was released on Thursday after the national assembly approved a limited amnesty law, might slow the march towards democracy, but would not halt it.
“Right now my role is to lead the reorganisation of the opposition movement in Caracas and to try to be the voice of the political prisoners,” he said. “I’m going to fight until every political prisoner is free … And I will try to fight until we have a transition to democracy.”

We conduct affairs of state in a building that’s riddled with asbestos and mice. Can’t Britain do any better? | Rupa Huq

Kemi Badenoch, mid-TV interview with Robert Peston at the House of Commons recently, was embarrassingly upstaged by a mouse. Just another day in a parliament building not fit for purpose.
Last week, a critical meeting between the prime minister and his more than 400 MPs plus assorted peers (who total another 800) happened in a room only big enough to accommodate 170. Consider that the Commons chamber itself seats only 430 of the total 650 MPs. That same day, exhibition boards went up around parliament explaining the “restoration and renewal” options for the Palace of Westminster. They are expected to be voted on as early as March.
Consider them and ponder whether this is how you want the nation’s most pressing affairs of state to be organised. One scenario has MPs relocating to different bits of parliament’s footprint while the works are executed, occupying the House of Lords during the redoing of the Commons chamber. There is precedent for this during the blitz when the House of Commons was bombed; many a Churchillian line such as “we will fight them on the beaches” was uttered from the red benches of the Lords rather than the Commons’ green benches.
Then there is the “full decant” option, in which both houses would move while the job is done. Neither option comes cheap. It would be an estimated £8.4-£11.5bn and take 19 to 24 years for the full decant, whereas staying put would come at a whopping £11.8-£18.7bn and take somewhere between 38 and a staggering 61 years.
The Palace of Westminster has been my workplace for 11 years. I love it dearly. But it desperately needs an urgent upgrade. ITV viewers may have been surprised by the sight of Badenoch and a mouse but we 650 honourable members were not. Nor were the few thousand parliamentary pass holders encompassing clerks, journalists and cleaners. Parliament is overrun with vermin – our furry friends can often be seen in parliament’s various dining rooms. We watch as they laugh at the bait boxes laid out for them.
The quantity of repairs needed to bring the place up to scratch is immense. Even the modern part of the parliamentary estate – the 1990s Portcullis House with its glass-topped atrium – has not weathered well. The lack of mobility-friendly features confirms that this is not a place suitable for disabled people – only 12% of the estate floor space has step-free access, which would never be allowed in a contemporary building.
Parliament is awe-inspiring (it’s not many people who get to work under Big Ben), but it’s visibly falling apart – 19 stonemasonry incidents have occurred since 2016. The magnificent gold leaf-finished ceiling of central lobby, which gave the world the verb “to lobby”, has visible gaps and reportedly sheds tiny invisible fragments of asbestos, a hazard to health. The cavernous, ancient Westminster Hall, dating to 1097, where the late Queen Elizabeth II lay in state, is resolutely immune to getting any internet or mobile phone reception; highly impractical if you are arranging to meet people there who are running late and messaging you to say so.
In my 11 years in the job, I have now seen many iterations of the proposals for improvements – including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove’s unpopular wheeze to move parliament to York.
After my third election (I’ve done four), I signed up for the MPs’ parliamentary basement tour and it was like travelling through time to some sort of illicit bat cave. Among the grisly sights were the rusting pipes (14 miles of Bakelite-looking tubing that caused 80 leaks in the archaic steam heating system in 2024-25), the ropey-looking electrics (roughly 250 miles of cabling past its prime) and ample evidence of the rodents that obviously keep busy when not fulfilling supporting roles on television.
We have a prime minister keen to expel political rats out of No 10, but he faces an even more difficult job driving rodents out of the Hogwarts-like parliamentary estate, and making it fit for a thriving, modern democracy.
Whether an upgrade happens because we have all moved into the Lords or because we have temporarily headed off somewhere else altogether, it must happen. If the state of parliament reflects the state of the nation, both need to see better days.

Taiwan’s parliament is set to prioritise review of a disputed NT$1.25 trillion (US$40 billion) special defence budget bill when its new session begins on Tuesday, as pressure mounts from Washington.
But US President Donald Trump’s recent remarks about consulting Chinese President Xi Jinping on arms sales could complicate the debate, potentially giving Taipei’s opposition parties greater room to manoeuvre and reshape the final version of the bill, according to analysts.
The renewed push follows an unusual bipartisan letter from 37 US lawmakers on February 12 urging Taiwan’s legislature to fully fund the eight-year package.

The lawmakers warned that Beijing’s “military pressure is intensifying” and that approving only part of the budget proposed by Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te in November “could weaken deterrence”.
They stressed that Taipei “must demonstrate resolve by increasing defence spending” in line with Lai’s proposal.

In response, Taiwan’s legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu said the bill would be “given top priority” once lawmakers returned to work on February 24 after the Lunar New Year recess.
He described Taiwan-US ties as “grounded in shared democratic values and a joint commitment to maintaining stability in the Indo-Pacific”.

Software connection: US firm opens doors for global adoption of China’s humanoid robots
OpenMind works with several Chinese robotics companies including Unitree, UBTech, AgiBot and Engine AI
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
US software company OpenMind, according to founder and CEO Jan Liphardt, caused a commotion last year at a park in San Francisco where the firm shot a promotional video.
“A crowd of people came, children came running, cars stopped and the police came,” he said, because “there was a robot in the park”.
In an interview, Liphardt told the South China Morning Post that such a scenario would have been treated differently on the other side of the world. “If a [Unitree] G1 walked across the street in Shanghai, people do not stop. They’ve seen this before.”

That contrast highlighted the opportunity for OpenMind – developer of the OM1 open-source and artificial intelligence-native operating system for robots – to serve as a bridge to the rest of the world for China’s humanoid robot makers.
China is “unquestionably ahead” of the US in robotics hardware, according to Liphardt, citing its mature integrated supply chain and intense domestic competition.

He said OpenMind already worked with several Chinese companies – including Unitree Robotics, UBTech Robotics, AgiBot, LimX Dynamics, Booster Robotics and Engine AI – as these firms turned their attention to overseas markets.

A sketchy recollection
“Trevor Dallen’s mention of Emile Mercier (C8) brought back memories of the books of his cartoons which my older sister collected,” writes Ann Clydsdale of Bathurst. “He had a way with street signs, breaking up words in unconventional ways. Hence, ‘Bus Stop’ became ‘Bust Op’, and ‘No Smoking’ became ‘Nosmo King’. There was also a little old man in a deer stalker hat and with a long beard depicted in most cartoons. Someone told me that it represented Mercer himself. Not sure if that was true or not, though.”
“Nosmo King is still around isn’t he?” inquires Peter Gibbs of Yass. “Signs everywhere. Very popular person.”
Suzanne Saunders of Wadeville has some unwelcome news for Nick Bencsik regarding jingle earworms (C8): “You can’t switch it off, Nick. Actually, you ought to be congratulated.”
“At 76 years, I have decided that my occasional memory loss is due to my hard drive being full, and I would like a way to shed unnecessary data,” says Alan Nicholas of Sandringham. “Like the full lyrics of Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini.”
Paul Fergus of Croydon sympathises with Gail Grogan (C8) over the recent “language abomination” that came in the form of “premise” (singular for a building instead of premises), but has a theory: “I wonder whether the Health official called to task by Gail was laying the foundations for an edifice.”
It makes sense for Eric Scott of Bondi Junction: “Two academics in adjacent apartment blocks used to argue across the gap between their balconies but could never agree because they were arguing from different premises.”
“Listening to a radio news report on the passing of actor Robert Duvall they mentioned one of his early roles was in How To Kill a Mockingbird,” notes Bret White of Sanctuary Point. “It left me wondering if the finches were spared.” Indeed, but it might explain why he agreed to star in Lonesome Dove.
Chris Wilmott of Austinmer says that “the ubiquitous American letter box with the little red flag solves Geoff Bartlett’s ‘do I or don’t I need to look’ problem (C8). No bells or whistles needed. I have been told some are being painted orange of late.” Greg King of Springwood says his parents had one in the 1960s for “their brand new triple-fronted red brick veneer house in Parramatta”, and describes it as “an analogue solution for the times”.

Erdoğan rolls out incentives to expand small livestock farming
Unknown

18:59:45 KST

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Feb. 21 unveiled a new support package aimed at boosting small livestock farming, saying the government will distribute animals, provide financial assistance and expand agricultural support programs.
Under the project, producers will initially be given 150,000 small livestock animals under favorable conditions. Each producer will receive 95 female and five male animals, while the state will provide annual maintenance and feeding support of 180,000 Turkish Liras ($4,100) for the livestock.
Producers will be able to finance the project through interest-free loans, with repayment options including a grace period of up to two years followed by repayment over as long as seven years.
"We will cover the insurance of the small livestock animals received by our producers benefiting from the project for one year," Erdoğan said at an event with farmers at the Haliç Congress Center in Istanbul.
He also said animals with superior genetics raised on farms of the General Directorate of Agricultural Enterprises (TİGEM) will be distributed according to breeds suited to different regions.
"In this project, we will prioritize women and young producers. We will also give priority to young graduates from veterinary medicine, agriculture and food engineering who apply to this project. In this way, our young people will both establish their own businesses in their homeland and contribute to production and employment," he said.
"We will deliver the first animals to our breeders this year. I invite all young and female producers who want to engage in small ruminant farming to apply to this project."
Erdoğan said the government paid a total of 47 billion liras ($1.07 billion) last year to producers affected by agricultural frost in April, warning that changing climate conditions and global warming mean similar events are likely to continue and urging farmers to take out agricultural insurance.
He added that following livestock support payments made last year under a production plan launched in 2024, as well as payments for plant production will begin next month.
"Starting from March 6, we will transfer 81 billion liras [$1.84 billion] in basic and planned production support payments to our farmers' accounts within one month," he said.
Erdoğan said production has started in 14 "organized agricultural regions" and will begin for the first time in five additional areas this year.
He said total support provided to the sector in 2025 — including direct aid, credit support, investment allocations, intervention purchases and export support — reached 706 billion liras ($16.1 billion), while the amount allocated to agriculture directly and indirectly for 2026 is 939 billion liras ($21.4 billion).

- On 06 February 2026, the Commander in Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF), General Syrskyi, confirmed Ukraine had initiated a counterattack near Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia oblast. Since the start of this counterattack, Ukraine has taken over 100 sq km of territory, mostly to the north of Huliaipole. In addition, Ukrainian forces also made limited gains to the north of this sector, most notably in the vicinity of Verbove, 14 km southeast of Pokrovske.
- It is likely these efforts have disrupted Russian momentum and delayed Russian offensive operations towards Orikhiv city from the east. Orikhiv is an important fortified logistics hub, underpinning the defence of central Zaporizhzhia.
- Further north, Ukrainian forces maintain control of the city of Kupiansk, a former rail logistics hub in Kharkiv oblast, securing the boundaries to mitigate against continued Russian infiltration attempts. Limited numbers of Russian infiltrators are reported to remain in the city, occupying high rise buildings. Ukrainian forces commenced their counter-attack in the northwest quadrant of Kupiansk in mid-December 2025.

Ben-Gvir's National Guard operating without formal legal approval or clear authority, report shows
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
09:52:16 UTC
18:52:16 KST

A new report by the Knesset Research and Information Center has found that Israel’s National Guard is recruiting fighters, establishing brigades, receiving budget allocations and conducting operational activities despite the absence of formal legislation or publicly approved regulations governing its authority.
The report, published this week, states that the government has yet to release the official committee report on the guard’s establishment or formally approve its activation. Nevertheless, the operational body is already functioning.
The National Guard is one of the flagship initiatives of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. A formal inauguration ceremony was held in January 2025, and designated budget lines were included in the 2026 state budget. Fighters are actively being recruited to “Southern” and “Central” brigades, and the unit has reportedly taken part in operational activities, including dispersing demonstrators during protests against the government.
According to the Knesset report, the National Guard is operating without clear legal authority. The Knesset research center said the National Security Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for information. “The ministry did not respond to our inquiry, despite several repeated reminders,” wrote Dr. Nurit Yachimovich-Cohen, a senior researcher at the center. As a result, the report said, the Knesset, which oversees the government’s work, does not have full information regarding the guard’s powers, chain of command or binding procedures.
The report also highlights the establishment in August 2025 of the “National Guard and Civil Defense Administration,” operating under the National Security Ministry. The administration oversees the National Guard alongside civilian emergency response units and protective infrastructure budgets.
Despite its broad responsibilities and resources, the report states: “We did not find regulation or procedures for the activity of the National Guard or for the activity of the administration.” A government committee that was meant to convene to formulate procedures for the guard has not met, the report said. No dedicated legislation has been enacted to establish the guard as an independent body, nor have comprehensive public procedures been issued clarifying its status.
At the same time, the report notes that the National Guard has been established and is operating in practice. An official inauguration ceremony was held, budgets were allocated through the National Security Ministry, recruitment and training efforts have taken place, and the unit operates on the ground under the Border Police, a branch of the Israel Police.
The guard exists, is funded and carries out operational activity, but without a comprehensive legislative framework clearly defining its status. It remains unclear whether the National Guard is an independent body, a unit within the police or a separate branch within the National Security Ministry. In practice, it operates through the Border Police and the Israel Police, but without explicit legislation defining the lines of authority and subordination among the police commissioner, the minister and professional command ranks. The report also states there is no clear public delineation of powers distinguishing the National Guard from existing forces, nor formal regulation of professional boundaries between the Border Police and the National Guard.
At the inauguration ceremony early last year, Ben-Gvir said: “Our future requires not only relying on existing forces, but developing more and more forces to ensure the stability of the state. The guard is the flagship program — it is a symbol and proof that if you will it, it is no dream. I believe the National Guard will be an integral part of our security system and will provide Israel’s citizens with the sense of security they deserve.”
Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai’s successor, Commissioner Danny Levy, also welcomed the move at the time, calling the National Guard brigades a “dedicated game-changing force” that would strengthen public security and governance and wage an uncompromising fight against terrorism and serious crime.
Concerns over professional independence
The Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem-based research organization, has expressed opposition to the creation of the body and warned of potential harm to professional independence.
In a legal opinion published by the institute, it said professional independence is a fundamental condition for any body vested with law enforcement authority, as such powers may infringe on human rights including liberty, privacy, freedom of expression and freedom of movement. “Infringement of these rights must be carried out sparingly and only when there is no other way to achieve the purpose of the law,” the opinion said.
The institute also warned that without maintaining professional independence from the supervising minister, there is a risk of selective enforcement, political exploitation of authority or excessive use of powers against political opponents and minorities.
In response, the National Security Ministry and the Israel Police said: “A governmental dialogue is currently taking place between the National Security Ministry, the Defense Ministry and other ministries in order to advance a government decision that will adopt the conclusions of the committee regulating the National Guard.”

Pro-Palestinian activists intimidate Jewish residents in UK, push for Israel boycott

Pro-Palestinian activists in the UK have been accused of intimidating Jewish residents during a door-to-door campaign calling for a boycott of Israeli goods, The Telegraph reported Saturday.
The activists, associated with the Apartheid-Free Zone (AFZ) movement, have been canvassing neighborhoods in Hackney, Bristol, Sheffield, and Brighton, urging residents to shun products made in Israel, the report said.
The campaign, which has sparked significant concern, was criticized on Friday by Jewish groups and politicians, who described the actions as crossing a line of acceptable activism and urged police to take note of allegations of harassment and violence.
The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity dedicated to protecting British Jews from antisemitism, condemned the door-knocking efforts, stating that “turning up uninvited at homes in an area with a large Jewish community to push a political agenda of this nature is intimidating and crosses a serious line.”
The controversy deepened after an alleged incident in Sheffield, where a woman claimed to have been headbutted by an activist associated with the AFZ. The report said the woman was counter-protesting with her partner when she was allegedly assaulted.
Another round of protests is expected over the weekend
Politicians, including Labour MP Peter Kyle, have also raised concerns, with Kyle reporting the activities to local police for possible hate crime investigations.
“My immediate thought was for the appalling scenario of a vulnerable Jewish resident being door-knocked by a gang of people wanting to harangue them,” Kyle told Sky News.
Police said no arrests have been made.
Despite these allegations, anti-Israel campaigners in Bristol and Hackney were preparing for another round of protests over the weekend, while concerns about the safety of Jewish residents continue to grow.
Hackney is home to one of the largest ultra-Orthodox (haredi) Jewish communities outside New York and Israel.

Iran and the United States have differing views over the scope and mechanism to lift sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday, adding that new talks were planned in early March.
The official said Tehran could seriously consider a combination of exporting part of its highly enriched uranium (HEU) stockpile, diluting the purity of its HEU, and a regional consortium for enriching uranium, but in return, Iran's right to "peaceful nuclear enrichment" must be recognized.
"The negotiations continue, and the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists," the official said.
Iran's Araqchi to present counterproposal amid nuclear talks
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday that he expected to have a draft counterproposal ready within days following nuclear talks with the United States this week, while US President Donald Trump said he was considering limited military strikes.
The senior official said Tehran will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources, but US companies can always participate as contractors in Iran’s oil and gas fields.

The carnival bear, the sacrosanct emblem that was locked up on November 11 and reappeared on Thursday, led the procession through the old town. Dozens of costumed groups and musicians braved the drizzle and set the mood. The procession ended in front of the Federal Palace, where the brass bands gave a “monster concert”.
The Bern Carnival was revived in the 1980s and is currently battling a growing lack in interest. According to the organising committee, the number of musicians taking part in the procession has almost halved. The number of visitors is also down.
+ Why do some Swiss dress up as Japanese during carnival?
The future is uncertain. “We’ll be reassessing the situation every year,” Michelle Uetz, president of the Berner Fasnacht association, told Swiss public broadcaster SRF this week. She added: “We may have to reduce the size of the event in future and adapt the programme.” The financial situation is already a little tight, she said.

Arab, Muslim nations slam ‘inflammatory’ remarks by US ambassador to Israel
Several members of the Arab League, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) on Sunday issued a joint statement condemning remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, that it “would be fine” if Israel took over a huge swath of the Middle East.
Arab and Islamic countries issued a joint condemnation on Sunday of remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of far-right commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: "It would be fine if they took it all."
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments – alongside three major regional organisations – issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory".
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The joint statement affirmed their “categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks”, which contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
The statement noted that "Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands”, And reaffirmed a “categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states".

Iran joined the chorus with its foreign ministry accusing Huckabee on X of revealing "American active complicity" in what it called Israel's "expansionist wars of aggression" against Palestinians.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador's words as "reckless" and "irresponsible", while Jordan said it was "an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region".
Kuwait decried what it called a "flagrant violation of the principles of international law", while Oman said the comments "threatened the prospects for peace" and stability in the region.
Egypt's foreign ministry reaffirmed "that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands".
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank".
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations".
Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of anti-Semitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes – a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.

Government unveils sweeping reforms to cut achievement gap in schools
- The government plans to reform education in England, aiming to halve the achievement gap between disadvantaged and more affluent pupils by the time children born under this government finish secondary school.
- Targeted disadvantage funding for schools will be reformed, moving away from Free School Meal eligibility to consider factors like family income, its duration, and location.
- Two new programmes, Mission North East and Mission Coastal, will be introduced to address the poorer performance of disadvantaged pupils in specific regions.
- Reforms to special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision include reassessing Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) at the end of primary school from 2029 and introducing legally binding Individual Support Plans (ISPs).
- There will also be incentives of up to £15,000 for new headteachers in areas needing them most.

Relics of Italy’s patron saint, St Francis of Assisi, to go on public show for first time
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ASSISI, Italy – St Francis of Assisi’s skeleton is going on public display from Feb 22 for the first time for the 800th anniversary of his death, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors.
Inside a nitrogen-filled plexiglass case with the Latin inscription “Corpus Sancti Francisci” (The Body of St Francis), the remains are being shown in the Italian hill town’s Basilica of St Francis of Assisi.
St Francis, who died on Oct 3, 1226, founded the Franciscan order after renouncing his wealth and devoting his life to the poor.
Mr Giulio Cesareo, director of communications for the Franciscan convent in Assisi said he hoped the display could be “a meaningful experience” for believers and non-believers alike.
Mr Cesareo, a Franciscan friar, said the “damaged” and “consumed” state of the bones showed that St Francis “gave himself completely” to his life’s work.
His remains, which will be on display until March 22, were transferred to the basilica built in the saint’s honour in 1230.
But it was only in 1818, after excavations carried out in utmost secrecy, that his tomb was rediscovered.
Apart from previous exhumations for inspection and scientific examination, the bones of St Francis have only been displayed once, in 1978, to a very limited public and for just one day.
Usually hidden from view, the transparent case containing the relics since 1978 was brought out on Feb 21 from the metal coffer in which it is kept, inside his stone tomb in the crypt of the basilica.
The case is itself inside another bullet-proof and anti-burglary glass case.
Surveillance cameras will operate 24 hours a day for added protection of the remains.
St Francis is Italy’s patron saint and the 800th anniversary commemorations of his death will also see the restoration of an Oct 4 public holiday in his honour.
The holiday had been scrapped nearly 50 years ago for budget reasons.
Its revival is also a tribute to late Pope Francis who took on the saint’s name.
Pope Francis died in 2025
‘Not a movie set’
Reservations to see the saint’s remains already amount to “almost 400,000 (people) coming from all parts of the world, with of course a clear predominance from Italy,” said Mr Marco Moroni, guardian of the Franciscan convent.
“But we also have Brazilians, North Americans, Africans,” he added.
During this rather quiet time of year, the basilica usually sees 1,000 visitors per day on weekdays, rising to 4,000 on weekends.
The Franciscans said they were expecting 15,000 visitors per day on weekdays and up to 19,000 on Saturdays and Sundays for the month-long display of the remains.
“From the very beginning, since the time of the catacombs, Christians have venerated the bones of martyrs, the relics of martyrs, and they have never really experienced it as something macabre,” Mr Cesareo said.
What “Christians still venerate today, in 2026, in the relics of a saint is the presence of the Holy Spirit,” he said.
Another church in Assisi holds the remains of Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died in 2006 and who was canonised in September by Pope Leo XIV.
Experts said the extended display of St Francis’s remains should not affect their state of preservation.
“The display case is sealed, so there is no contact with the outside air. In reality, it remains in the same conditions as when it was in the tomb,” Mr Cesareo said.
The light, which will remain subdued in the church, should also not have an effect.
“The basilica will not be lit up like a stadium,” Mr Cesareo said. “This is not a movie set.” AFP

Russia has lost around 1,259,780 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on Feb. 22.
The number includes 890 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.
According to the report, Russia has lost 11,694 tanks, 24,069 armored combat vehicles, 79,500 vehicles and fuel tanks, 37,470 artillery systems, 1,652 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,303 air defense systems, 435 aircraft, 348 helicopters, 142,113 operational-tactical drones, 29 ships and boats, and two submarines.
Ukraine’s General Staff has not revealed its own losses during the full-scale invasion, citing operational secrecy.
While Ukrainian officials rarely disclose figures, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action since the beginning of the full-scale war, in addition to many more classified as missing in action (MIA).
The intensity of Russian drones and fighting has made it difficult for Ukraine to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, which are needed for DNA confirmation.
Independent Western think-tank reports agree that the Russian casualties significantly surpass Ukraine’s losses, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimating the ratio to be "roughly 2.5:1 or 2:1."
A January 2026 CSIS report said Ukraine has likely suffered between 500,000 and 600,000 casualties from February 2022 to December 2025, of which between 100,000 to 140,000 are thought to be killed in action (KIA).

Türkiye and Saudi Arabia to sign 5GW renewable deal phase two at COP31

Türkiye and the Saudi Arabian company Acwa are set to sign the second phase of a 5-gigawatt renewable energy cooperation deal at the UN climate summit COP31 to be held in Antalya, Türkiye, later this year, Acwa chairman Mohammad Abunayyan told Anadolu.
The planned signing would cover the remaining 3 gigawatts of capacity under a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, following this week’s deal for the first 2 gigawatts of solar projects in Türkiye's central provinces of Sivas and Karaman.
“We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,” Abunayyan told Anadolu in an interview on Friday on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for the Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects.
The new phase “will be a mix between solar and wind and storage,” he added, noting that the company is also considering integrating storage into the initial 2-gigawatt solar projects.
The first phase, signed this week, is part of a broader 5-gigawatt framework agreed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Saudi Arabia on February 3. Abunayyan said that the construction of the 2 gigawatts of solar capacity is expected to begin next year after permits and environmental approvals are completed, with the first electricity targeted for early 2028.
“We are going to start our dispatch of the first electricity of this 2 gigawatts by the beginning of 2028, and we will be able to produce it all in 2028,” he said, describing it as a “very fast track project.”
COP31, scheduled for November 9-20 this year, will be held in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, with a leaders’ summit expected in Istanbul. Nearly 200 countries are anticipated to participate in the UN climate talks, which are set to focus on implementing the Paris Agreement, including emissions reduction targets, adaptation efforts, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.
Türkiye's 120-gigawatt renewable capacity target
Abunayyan said the first projects would deliver what he called the most competitive electricity prices in Türkiye while incorporating local content and Turkish contractors. “It will deliver the most competitive cost that you could imagine in Türkiye,” he said. “It’s going to deliver local content.”
He praised Türkiye’s renewable energy strategy, calling it “a great strategy” and “ambitious,” and noted the country’s goal to add 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2035.
“This project … is really a start of this 80 gigawatts,” he said.
Türkiye aims to increase its total installed solar and wind capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2035, which implies adding about 80 gigawatts to current levels. To achieve that target, the country would need to install roughly 9 gigawatts of new capacity each year.
Abunayyan also linked the next phase to the diplomatic visibility of the climate summit.
“We cannot find a better occasion than this great COP31 to demonstrate to the whole world the partnership between Türkiye and Saudi Arabia,” he said. “Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, they are not only giving promises or talks, but they are also implementing.”
The total investment under the 5-gigawatt framework is expected to reach $4-$5 billion, he said, adding that the cooperation would “bring our economic relationship with Türkiye much stronger.”
On financing, Abunayyan said the projects would follow a project finance structure combining equity and international debt.
“Many financial institutions will be behind it and will make it happen,” he said, citing improved economic conditions and credit ratings in Türkiye. Financial close is targeted for 2027.
Beyond solar and wind, Abunayyan said Acwa is also exploring opportunities in green hydrogen and desalination in Türkiye, arguing that renewable energy combined with storage and hydrogen will be central to long-term decarbonization.
“When you have renewable, when you have a very efficient cost of renewable, then you need to think about green hydrogen,” he said, and added: “The green hydrogen is the energy of the future.”

Ahmed Al Ahmed reveals what he said to Bondi gunman when he turned his weapon on him

Ahmed Al Ahmed reveals what he said to Bondi gunman when he turned his weapon on him
From suburban businessman to global hero, Ahmed Al Ahmed says he will never forget the moment he stared evil in the eye and he says it was the sound of women and children screaming for help that gave him the courage to take on a terrorist.
In an Australian first interview with 60 Minutes, the 44-year-old revealed what he said to gunman Sajid Akram after he tackled him to the ground, and how he is still living with two bullets from the December 14 terror attack at Bondi lodged in his shoulder.
He also detailed his snap decision to tackle Sajid Akram and wrestle a high-powered gun from the shooter’s hands.
“He didn’t say anything. Only I can see with his teeth, showing anger, as a devil, you know?” he told 60 Minutes.
The former tobacco shop owner from Sydney’s south visited Bondi Beach that Sunday evening almost by accident, searching for an afternoon coffee with his cousin Hothefa, when they came across the Chanukah by the Sea gathering at Archer Park.
As Ahmed retraced his steps through the park for the first time since that fateful summer evening, he recalled the sound of happy families celebrating the Jewish tradition of light over darkness.
Ahmed can also vividly remember the moment when joy turned to terror, as rapid gunfire erupted.
“I’m hearing heavy, heavy shooting, like a war. I can hear all the kids, women, everyone crying, you know, screaming,” he said.
As Sajid Akram and his son Naveed Akram carried out their lethal attack from the footbridge, Ahmed took cover between two parked cars, metres from the armed men.
Trying to shield himself from relentless bullets being aimed directly at the crowd, Ahmed says it was the harrowing sound of cries for help that propelled him into action.
Footage from that day captured the chilling twist when Sajid Akram left the footbridge and crept along the park’s edge towards hundreds of terrified and helpless people cowering nearby.
Ahmed said he couldn’t see the attacker approaching, but that another innocent bystander crouching nearby mouthed to him that the gunman was on his way.
“This guy kept telling me, ‘he’s coming, he’s coming’ and then he said, ‘he’s here’.”
“I asked God, ‘help me’. I didn’t think, I just saw it, do it.”
Ahmed can still feel Sajid Akram’s “strong and muscular” frame when he leapt onto his back and forced him to the ground.
“I run into him and hit him with my hand, right hand in his head and grab him into my arm, you know, his, his face, his neck, try to hold him, you know, with my arm,” Ahmed said.
Ahmed reveals for the first time what he said to Sajid Akram as he snatched the weapon out of the terrorist’s hands and turned it back on the shooter.
“Motherf---er, stop what you doing … You motherf---er, piece of shit,” Ahmed said.
Ahmed said he does not regret not shooting at the terrorist himself.
“Because I’m a human being, and I don’t wanna put my hand in blood,” he said. “My target was just to take the gun and stop him from killing a human being.”
Fifteen people were killed and 40 more were injured, including Ahmed, who was shot five times in his left shoulder, which he said was payback for trying to stop the atrocity and save lives.
“In this moment, I start screaming, ‘help’ and then asking my God, ‘Give me power, give me patience’,” he said. “I start feeling hot, my heart starts pumping, and then I start feeling sweaty. I was thinking I’m gonna die.”
Still recovering from his critical gunshot wounds, the reality of what Ahmed survived that day is only starting to set in for him. The murder of 10-year-old Matilda, the youngest of the 15 innocent victims, haunts him the most.
“I think all the time about this girl, I cry. Why? Why to the little girl, an angel like her,” Ahmed said.
Two months on from Australia’s deadliest terror attack, Ahmed is still in a lot of pain, two of the five bullets remain lodged within his shoulder and his left hand has little to no feeling.
Medical tests can’t detect any nerve activity yet, adding to Ahmed’s fear that he might never get full use of his hand back.
But asked if he would do it again, the ordinary man who did something extraordinary doesn’t falter.
“I will do it again and again and again. And anywhere in the world. If I have power and I have a life, I will do it.“

Iranian students clash with militia as fresh protests erupt
Marchers condemned Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a ‘murderous leader’
- Bookmark

Students staged protests at several Iranian universities on Saturday, marking the start of a new semester with clashes between demonstrators and pro-government factions, according to local news agencies and posts on social media.
The unrest coincided with mourning ceremonies, traditionally held after 40 days, for those killed during January’s anti-government demonstrations.
They saw thousands lose their lives in the most severe domestic upheaval since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A video, reportedly from Tehran's Sharif University of Technology, showed marchers condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “murderous leader” and advocating for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's deposed shah, to assume a new monarchical role.
State-affiliated news agencies such as SNN carried videos of clashes, with protesters allegedly injuring volunteer student Basij militia by throwing rocks at Iran's top engineering university.
Pro-government Basij members often assist security forces in quelling protests.
Protests were also held in Beheshti and Amir Kabir universities in the capital Tehran and Mashhad University in the northeast, according to videos published by rights group HAALVSH, which Reuters could not verify.
In the western town of Abdanan, a hotspot for protests, demonstrators chanted "Death to Khamenei" and "Death to the dictator" after the arrest of an activist teacher, according to rights group Hengaw and social media posts.
The January protests saw US President Donald Trump slap a new tariff on Iran’s trading partners and move the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
Mr Pahlavi accused the Tehran regime of killing an Iranian protester “every 14 seconds” amid a brutal crackdown.
However, Mr Trump said he had received assurances that planned executions were not taking place.
January 8 and 9 were the most deadly 48 hours of the protests, when security forces began firing lethal rounds on protesters under the cover of an internet blackout.
A network of doctors inside Iran estimates the national death toll could exceed 30,000 people. This far outstrips the regime’s figure of 3,117 dead reported on Iranian state TV.

Ryan Garcia defeats Mario Barrios to win WBC welterweight title
Garcia is the new world champion after a unanimous points decision victory against title holder.
Ryan Garcia has won the WBC welterweight title with a dominant unanimous decision over Mario Barrios.
Garcia dropped Barrios in the opening seconds on Saturday night in Las Vegas, Nevada, and controlled the fight with sharp combinations. The 27-year-old stayed patient after the early knockdown and turned more conservative late with a big lead.

At the Paris Agricultural Show, Macron visits in relative calm

The 62nd Paris International Agricultural Show opened without cattle and with a president kept at arm's length. A strange atmosphere filled the aisles of the Parc des Expositions at Porte de Versailles in Paris's 15th arrondissement on Saturday, February 21. For the inauguration of his eighth show as president, Emmanuel Macron found himself at the crossroads of urgent domestic and international issues, as well as facing fierce criticism from agricultural unions deeply dissatisfied with his leadership, all under a tight police presence.
Arriving at around 8:30 am, Macron made a beeline for the show's mascot cow, Biguine, a Brahman from Martinique. But this year, it was only a hologram. An outbreak of lumpy skin disease had forced the cancellation of this emblematic section of the show, where cows and oxen usually mingle with throngs of curious visitors. Fearing contagion, breeders had opted out of the parade.
"It's dismal – there's no smell of cows, no sounds," lamented Stéphane Travert, centrist chair of the Assemblée Nationale's Economic Affairs Committee. President Macron had urged the show's organizers to maintain the presence of cattle in order to preserve the event's agricultural spirit. To no avail. "We can be pleased that we are winning the fight against lumpy skin disease for good. Since the beginning of the year, there have been no new cases," he said.

Palestinian teen dies of injuries from Israeli gunfire in West Bank
At least 1,117 Palestinians killed, 11,500 injured by Israeli fire in West Bank since October 2023
RAMALLAH, Palestine
A Palestinian teenager died Sunday of wounds he sustained from Israeli army fire in the northern West Bank, the Health Ministry said.
A ministry statement said that Mohammad Hanani, 17, breathed his last in the town of Beit Furik, east of Nablus.
Hanani was shot in the head on Saturday evening during an Israeli military raid in the town, according to the official news agency Wafa.
Another 16-year-old was injured in the raid.
Israel has intensified operations in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023.
At least 1,117 Palestinians have been killed and around 11,500 others injured in attacks by the army and illegal settlers in the West Bank during that period.

UK’s new passport rules for dual citizens are result of border control in digital age
Sweden
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
10:37:16 CET
18:37:16 KST

From February 2026, most dual British citizens will need to use a British passport to travel to the UK. Presenting only a non-British passport will no longer be sufficient for boarding flights or ferries, unless it carries a certificate (costing £589) that confirms right of abode.
The rule was introduced to align dual nationals with the UK’s new electronic travel authorisation (ETA) system and to prevent confusion in border checks.
In legal terms, nothing fundamental has changed. British citizens still have the right to enter and live in the UK. But in practice, the way that right must be demonstrated has shifted. And that shift tells us something important about how citizenship is being reshaped in the digital age.
Over the past three decades, dual citizenship has become widely accepted internationally. In 1990, fewer than a third of countries allowed dual nationality in cases of naturalisation. By 2016, roughly three-quarters did.
This change reflected globalisation. As populations became more mobile, states adapted. Migrants often maintain attachments to more than one country. Dual citizenship is a pragmatic recognition of that reality, allowing people to belong in more than one place without forcing an exclusive choice.
According to the 2021 census, 1.2% of UK-born residents (587,600) were dual citizens with another country, rising from 0.5% in 2011 (231,600). For non-UK-born residents, 6.5% were dual citizens with the UK in 2021 (648,700), up from 5.1% in 2011 (381,200).
The rise reflects broader demographic change, but it also coincided with Brexit. The number of people holding both British and EU passports increased significantly between 2011 and 2021, suggesting that many UK residents sought to retain EU citizenship protections as the UK left the EU, while some EU residents acquired British citizenship to preserve unrestricted access to the UK.
In other words, dual citizenship in the UK today includes longstanding migrant and diasporic communities, but also a growing cohort shaped by recent geopolitical change.
Digital borders
The UK’s new passport rule does not mean the country is less tolerant of dual citizens. But it is a consequence of borders becoming more digitised in recent years.
Borders today are not confined to passport control desks. They operate through airline check-in systems, pre-travel authorisations, biometric databases and algorithmic risk assessments. Airlines are required to confirm eligibility before boarding. Digital systems match names, dates of birth and passport numbers against centralised records. Such systems prioritise coherence and consistency, aiming to eliminate ambiguity.
But dual citizenship, and transnational life more broadly, produce precisely the kind of complexity that digital systems struggle to accommodate. Names may differ across jurisdictions. Marriage can produce surname changes in one country but not another. Accent marks may appear in one passport and not in its transliteration. Children born abroad may be citizens by descent but have never held a British passport.
There is little room for discretion when border checks are digitised. The administrative solution is to use the British passport when entering Britain. Yet this is not always straightforward. Some dual citizens born abroad have never needed a British passport and must now apply for one in order to travel. Others may consider renouncing British citizenship to avoid the administrative burden — but this option is not available to underage dual citizens.
Dual citizens are not a homogeneous group. They include naturalised migrants who have retained their original nationality; British-born citizens who later acquired another citizenship through residence or marriage; children of mixed-nationality families; foreign-born children of British emigrants who are citizens by descent; and members of long-established Commonwealth communities whose plural affiliations are a result of British imperial history.
For some, the new rule simply means ensuring that their British passport is valid. For others — particularly families living abroad who have never needed a British passport for their children — it introduces an unexpected bureaucratic step.
This is where borders intersect with inequality. Families with easy access to consular services, financial resources and familiarity with UK administrative systems can adapt quickly. Those living further from British bureaucratic infrastructure face greater friction.
The UK’s passport requirement is being introduced during a wider political moment in which states are exerting tighter control over citizenship. In the US, Donald Trump’s administration pledged to restrict birthright citizenship and expand the state’s power to remove citizenship.
In a number of countries, citizenship revocation powers have disproportionately targeted dual nationals, precisely because removing citizenship from mono-nationals would breach international law by rendering them stateless.
What we may be witnessing is not the retreat of dual citizenship, but its transformation. It remains widely tolerated. Yet it is increasingly bureaucratically policed.
The cumulative effect is subtle but significant. Citizenship is no longer just a legal status secured once and for all. It must remain legible to digital border systems and be continuously probed through interconnected databases.
Dual citizenship emerged as recognition that identities and attachments can be layered. Digital borders, by contrast, favour clarity and singular representation. This tension is unlikely to disappear.
The UK’s move signals how, in an era of digital borders and geopolitical uncertainty, the lived experience of citizenship is being reshaped — not through headline constitutional change, but through the quiet reorganisation of administrative systems.

Tributes paid to 6 firefighters killed in central China after truck veers off cliff
Emergency workers were returning from putting out blaze at a hillside home in Hunan province
Relatives, colleagues and residents gathered in a county in central China on the weekend to pay tribute to six firefighters who died after putting out a blaze during the Chinese New Year holidays.
The firefighters were killed on Thursday afternoon when their truck ran off a cliff in Xinhua county, Hunan province, as they were returning from extinguishing a house fire in the hills.
A seventh firefighter in the truck was injured and transferred to a hospital in the capital city of Changsha that evening for further treatment, according to local media reports. The condition of the 29-year-old was reported to be stable before the transfer.
The men were among 10 or so firefighters sent in two vehicles to the scene of the burning timber home along a winding hillside road.
After putting out the blaze, which started at about 1pm, the crew were driving back down the road. One truck went over the edge as it was about to reach the main road at the foot of the mountain, according to media reports.
The crash occurred about 2km (1.2 miles) from the fire site and on a steep section of the hillside road, the reports said.

Iran slams US ambassador’s claim of Israel’s right to all Middle East
Huckabee claims Israel has biblical right to land stretching from Nile to Euphrates rivers, saying ‘It would be fine if they took it all’
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran condemned Sunday remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee in which he openly accepted Israel’s control over the entire Middle East, including the occupied West Bank.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said on the US social media company X that Huckabee’s statements are “a bold testament to American active complicity in Israeli regime's expansionist wars of aggression as well as its colonial genocide of Palestinians.”
Iran decries “‘such extremist ideological rhetoric’ that would only further embolden the occupying regime to persist in its atrocity crimes and illegal measures against Palestinians as well as its constant aggression against the nations of the region,” he added.
Huckabee argued on Friday that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: “It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s alleged right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission,” including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Trump's envoy Witkoff: Putin has never been anything other than straight with me
US President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Russian ruler Vladimir Putin has always been straightforward with him during meetings on the Russo-Ukrainian war.
Source: Witkoff in an interview with Fox News, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Speaking about his one-on-one talks with Putin, Witkoff said he had faced criticism over his meetings with the Russian leader.
"He has never been anything other than straight with me. And I say that, and I get attacked. But that's an accurate statement. He has told me that this is what his red lines are. You know, I got attacked for going to meet him eight times," the envoy said.
However, he insisted the meetings were necessary in order to strike a deal and could not have been avoided.
Quote: "How would you make a deal with someone on the other side unless you knew where the other person was coming from? I needed to understand what his motivations were, his goals and so forth. And I actually think that a lot of those meetings now are becoming very relevant. We understand where they [the Russians] are. And I don't think the Ukrainians disagree with us in our assessment. So I think those meetings were important, and hopefully we are going to consummate this whole thing [the war – ed.]."
Background:
- Witkoff also suggested that "good news" on ending Russia's war against Ukraine could emerge in the coming weeks and did not rule out a summit between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin.
- Following trilateral meetings in Geneva on 17-18 February, Zelenskyy said he sees progress in the military area of the talks but not in the political one.
- On 20 February, Zelenskyy said another round of talks with Russia and the US on ending the war could take place before the end of the month.

14 countries, including Türkiye, condemn US envoy’s remarks on Israeli control over Arab lands
US envoy to Israel argues Israel has 'biblical right' to land stretching from Nile to Euphrates rivers, saying ‘It would be fine if they took it all’
- 14 countries, including Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, voice 'strong condemnation and profound concern'
ISTANBUL
Fourteen countries and three regional organizations on Sunday condemned remarks by Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, who said "it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank."
In a joint statement, the foreign ministries of Türkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Indonesia, Kuwait, Palestine, Qatar, Oman, Pakistan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates expressed “strong condemnation and profound concern” over the comments.
The statement was also issued with the participation of the secretariats of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the League of Arab States, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
The ministries described the US envoy’s remarks as “dangerous and inflammatory,” saying they constitute “a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations” and pose a grave threat to regional security and stability.
They said the comments directly contradict the vision put forward by US President Donald Trump and the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, which is based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state.
The signatories said "the plan is grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence," warning that attempts "to legitimize control over the lands of others undermine these objectives, fuel tensions," and amount to incitement rather than advancing peace.
The ministries "reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands," the statement noted. "They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states."
The statement warned that "the continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine prospects for peace."
The signatories called for an end to what they termed "incendiary statements" and reiterated their "commitment to the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent state" along the June 4, 1967 lines, as well as to ending the occupation of all Arab lands.
US envoy defends expansive Israeli territorial claims
Mike Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
He argued that Israel has a "biblical right" to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.

Sean Strickland ends Anthony Hernandez’s win streak with TKO victory
The third-ranked Strickland hands Hernandez his first UFC defeat in more than five years.

Russian attacks across Ukraine killed at least 11 civilians and injured at least 38 over the past day, regional authorities reported early on Feb. 22.
Russia launched a large-scale combined drone and missile attack in the early hours of Sunday, firing 50 missiles and 297 long-range kamikaze drones, predominantly towards Kyiv and its suburbs. The Ukrainian Air Force reported downing 33 missiles and 274 drones.
The attack caused a building to collapse in the town of Fastiv, 60 kilometers southwest of Kyiv, killing a 49-year-old man and injuring seven others, according to Kyiv Oblast governor Mykola Kalashnyk. A total of fifteen people were injured across the oblast as a result of the attack, including four children, he said.
Kyiv city mayor Vitalii Klitschko earlier said that two people, a woman and a child, were hospitalized with injuries in the capital.
In Sumy Oblast, a drone strike on an emergency response vehicle killed four people, including a 17-year-old boy, according to regional authorities. The attack injured another passenger. In a similar attack also in the last 24 hours, one man was killed and two others severely injured after a drone struck their car. Four other civilians were also injured across the oblast due to drone and missile attacks in the last day.
In Donetsk Oblast, Russian attacks killed three civilians and injured one other, according to governor Vadym Filashkin.
Russia shelled populated areas at least 596 times in Zaporizhzhia Oblast in the last day, according to regional authorities. Two people died as a result.
Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that Russian attacks injured six people over the last day. The remains of a person killed in a shelling on Feb. 20 were also found, Syniehubov said.
In Dnipetrovsk Oblast, Govern Oleksandr Hanzha reported that Russia attacked the region over 50 times with drones and artillery over the last day, injuring three people, including an 84-year-old woman.
Russian shelling damaged residential buildings, houses and an administrative building in Kherson Oblast, governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported on Feb. 22. Four people were injured.

Trump says US is sending hospital boat to Greenland

President Donald Trump said Saturday, February 21, he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory that he has long coveted and threatened to seize by force. He said the boat would treat many "sick" people in Greenland, without providing any details on who he was referring to or the number of people the vessel would help.
"We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote in a social media post. "It's on the way!!!" he added.
Trump's rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Denmark, while putting the global spotlight on the Arctic as he insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and NATO security against Russia and China.
The post on his Truth Social platform carried an apparent AI image that depicted the USNS Mercy – an 894-foot (272-meter) vessel that is typically stationed in southern California – sailing toward snowcapped mountains on the horizon. It was unclear if that was the actual vessel being sent to Greenland.
Trump said in the post that the ship would be sent in coordination with Republican Governor Jeff Landry of Louisiana, who was named as Trump's envoy to the Arctic island in December. During Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans this month, Landry posted an image of himself and two men at one of the city's famous balls, holding a flag of Greenland together. "Great to host some of the wonderful people of Greenland," he wrote.
Earlier this week Denmark's King Frederik X visited Greenland, where he has long enjoyed popularity, as anxieties mount over Trump's interest.
Trump backed off repeated threats to seize the territory last month, after striking a "framework" deal with NATO chief Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.

British nuclear-powered attack submarine arrives in Australia for training drill
318-foot-long HMS Anson with 100-member crew, armed with torpedoes, land-attack missiles, anchored at naval base near Perth
ISTANBUL
A British nuclear-powered attack submarine arrived at a naval base in Western Australia on Sunday for a month-long visit, which London hailed as proof of its "unwavering" and "water-tight" commitment to the AUKUS pact, local media reports said.
The 97-meter-long (318-foot) HMS Anson, which has a crew of about 100 and is armed with both torpedoes and land-attack missiles, anchored at a naval base near the city of Perth, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
It is the first British nuclear-powered submarine to arrive at Australia's west coast since the US, UK, and Australia unveiled the full AUKUS pathway in San Diego, California, in 2023.
According to UK Deputy High Commissioner to Australia Brian Jones, the submarine will undergo maintenance and undertake joint exercises, providing an "invaluable opportunity" to help Canberra develop more experience with nuclear-powered submarines.
Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles, in a statement, described the visit as a "historic step in our nation’s readiness to operate and maintain conventionally‑armed, nuclear‑powered submarines."
The two countries are also expected to conduct AUKUS Pillar 2 tests while HMS Anson is within Australian waters.
Under the trilateral agreement inked in 2021, the Australian Navy will acquire eight nuclear-powered submarines over the next decade from the US and the UK. The first deliveries are expected to begin in 2032.
Last week, Australia announced that at least $21.2 billion will be spent building a construction yard to eventually build nuclear submarines for Canberra under the AUKUS agreement.

Türkiye, Saudi Arabia to sign 2nd phase of 5-GW renewable energy deal at COP31
'We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,' Abunayyan tells Anadolu in an interview on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects
ISTANBUL
Türkiye and the Saudi Arabian company Acwa are set to sign the second phase of a 5-gigawatt renewable energy cooperation deal at the UN climate summit COP31 to be held in Antalya, Türkiye, later this year, Acwa chairman Mohammad Abunayyan told Anadolu.
The planned signing would cover the remaining 3 gigawatts of capacity under a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, following this week’s deal for the first 2 gigawatts of solar projects in Türkiye's central provinces of Sivas and Karaman.
“We are going to sign 3 gigawatts in renewable and storage by COP31,” Abunayyan told Anadolu in an interview on Friday on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in Istanbul for the Sivas and Taseli solar power plant projects.
The new phase “will be a mix between solar and wind and storage,” he added, noting that the company is also considering integrating storage into the initial 2-gigawatt solar projects.
The first phase, signed this week, is part of a broader 5-gigawatt framework agreed during Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Feb. 3. Abunayyan said that the construction on the 2 gigawatts of solar capacity is expected to begin next year after permits and environmental approvals are completed, with the first electricity targeted for early 2028.
“We are going to start our dispatch of the first electricity of this 2 gigawatts by the beginning of 2028, and we will be able to produce it all in 2028,” he said, describing it as a “very fast track project.”
COP31, scheduled for Nov. 9-20 this year will be held in the Mediterranean city of Antalya, with a leaders’ summit expected in Istanbul. Nearly 200 countries are anticipated to participate in the UN climate talks, which are set to focus on implementing the Paris Agreement, including emissions reduction targets, adaptation efforts, climate finance, and carbon market mechanisms.
Türkiye's 120-gigawatt renewable capacity target
Abunayyan said the first projects would deliver what he called the most competitive electricity prices in Türkiye while incorporating local content and Turkish contractors. “It will deliver the most competitive cost that you could imagine in Türkiye,” he said. “It’s going to deliver local content.”
He praised Türkiye’s renewable energy strategy, calling it “a great strategy” and “ambitious,” and noted the country’s goal to add 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2035.
“This project … is really a starting of this 80 gigawatts,” he said.
Türkiye aims to increase its total installed solar and wind capacity to 120 gigawatts by 2035, which implies adding about 80 gigawatts to current levels. To achieve that target, the country would need to install roughly 9 gigawatts of new capacity each year.
Abunayyan also linked the next phase to the diplomatic visibility of the climate summit.
“We cannot find better than this great occasion of COP31 to demonstrate to the whole world the partnership between Türkiye and Saudi Arabia,” he said. “Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, they are not only giving promises or talks, they are implementing.”
The total investment under the 5-gigawatt framework is expected to reach $4-$5 billion, he said, adding that the cooperation would “bring our economic relationship with Türkiye much stronger.”
On financing, Abunayyan said the projects would follow a project finance structure combining equity and international debt.
“Many financial institutions will be behind it and will make it happen,” he said, citing improved economic conditions and credit ratings in Türkiye. Financial close is targeted for 2027.
Beyond solar and wind, Abunayyan said Acwa is also exploring opportunities in green hydrogen and desalination in Türkiye, arguing that renewable energy combined with storage and hydrogen will be central to long-term decarbonization.
“When you have renewable, when you have a very efficient cost of renewable, then you need to think about green hydrogen,” he said, and added: “The green hydrogen is the energy of the future.”

MOSCOW, February 22. /TASS/. Russia does not threaten Estonia or other countries, but it will always do what is necessary to ensure its own security. If Estonia has nuclear weapons aimed at Russia, Moscow will aim its own nuclear weapons at Estonia, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Pavel Zarubin, a journalist from Vesti.
"Estonia is very close to us, and we don't threaten Estonia, just like any other European country. However, if there are nuclear weapons on Estonian territory aimed at us, our nuclear weapons will be aimed at Estonian territory, and Estonia must clearly understand it. Russia will always do what it must to ensure its own security, especially when it comes to nuclear deterrence issues," he said when asked a respective question.
Earlier, the Baltic republic's Foreign Minister, Margus Tsahkna, stated that Estonian authorities did not rule out the deployment of nuclear weapons on the country's territory if such a decision was made within the framework of NATO defense plans.

The Israeli army carried out air strikes and artillery shelling across various parts of Gaza early on Sunday, despite a ceasefire agreement in force.
Israeli warplanes targeted eastern areas of the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, eyewitnesses told Anadolu.
Israeli military vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south, while naval forces fired toward the city’s coastline, according to the witnesses.
In Gaza City, Israeli fighter jets carried out air strikes on eastern areas, accompanied by sporadic artillery shelling on the same locations, eyewitnesses said.
A US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 612 Palestinians and injuring 1,640 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Iran targets doctors and lawyers for helping protesters
Iranian medics and lawyers tell Caspar Barnes and Moha Tahery about the persecution they face from the Islamic regime for helping anti-government protesters during the deadly crackdown
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In the days after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters, Amir*, a doctor in a private clinic outside Tehran, came face-to-face with one of the Islamic regime’s spies.
According to Amir, the man had entered the clinic during a night shift posing as a patient. Once the time of his appointment came, the man began interrogating the doctor.
He asked whether Amir had been working on the nights of 8 and 9 January – the most deadly 48 hours of the protests, when security forces began firing lethal rounds on protesters under the cover of an internet blackout.
“I dodged the questions as much as I could,” Amir says. “I think he was there to scare me more than to gather information because I think they have the information.”
Although he did not disclose this to his interrogator, Amir wasn’t supposed to be working on that now infamous 8 January: a bloodstained date that will likely be etched into the Iranian national psyche for generations.
A network of doctors inside Iran estimates the national death toll could exceed 30,000 people. This far outstrips the regime’s figure of 3,117 dead reported on Iranian state TV.
At around 9pm that Thursday night, Amir tells how he heard that regime forces were firing on protesters with live ammunition. He headed straight to his clinic to support his colleagues, one doctor and five nurses.
Over the course of that deadly weekend, Amir watched 30 people die in his clinic and patched up “between 120 to 150 gunshot wounds,” he says, losing track of the exact number in a muddle of blood and bullet holes.
Amir works in a small general practitioner’s clinic and does not have suitable equipment to treat the type of injuries more often seen on the front line of a warzone.
“There’s nothing I can do for a punctured lung or a gunshot that has broken the forehead,” he says. He and his colleagues were seeing multiple shots to the neck, abdomen and hands.
His patients that weekend ranged from a 12-year-old boy shot in the testicles to a 77-year-old man hit in the chest.
While this was happening, the clinic was also under attack by security forces. “They shot tear gas at us. They shot at the doorway of the clinic repeatedly both nights,” he says.
Outside the clinic, Amir saw the bodies of two people who had been shot. They may have been alive, but the medical staff were unable to help for fear of being hit by snipers or gunmen. This scene continues to haunt Amir.
Based on conversations with colleagues at other hospitals, he estimates that 400 to 500 people were killed in his city alone over the two deadliest nights of the protests.
At great personal risk, Amir has been handing his mobile number out to friends and colleagues he trusts so the injured can get in touch.
The regime has been tracking down those who attended anti-regime protests. Iran has some of the most advanced surveillance technology imported from China and Russia, according to reports by the British human rights organisation Article 19.
This includes facial recognition tools trained on Uyghurs in western China and censorship hardware which Iran used to entirely cut off its 93 million population from the internet.
A radiologist in the country told The Independent, “Many of the injured people did not go to hospitals out of fear.” He knew of at least one person who had died of their injuries at home.
As well as working in a private clinic, this radiologist works in a military hospital in one of the major cities in Iran.
“All doctors who have not completed their mandatory military service must serve in military medical centres,” he says.
Civilians completely avoid the military hospitals in times of crisis, as security forces are treated there. According to the radiologist, there were no deaths of security forces at the military hospital, although there were severe injuries.
The regime does not allow any independent lawyers to represent the estimated 42,000 people arrested during the protests, according to exiled Iranian lawyer Marzieh Mohebbi.
A prisoner who is lucky enough to survive will face judicial proceedings in which “virtually all principles of fair trial have been eliminated”, Mohebbi says.
Legal professionals have been targeted, too. At least one lawyer has died in police custody, according to the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center.
At the inaugural Board of Peace meeting on Thursday, 19 February, Donald Trump said that he will decide within 10 days if the US will strike Iran.
In June 2025, the US president made a similar statement before joining Israel’s bombing campaign against Iranian nuclear sites during its 12-day War.
In the days following the protests, Amir experienced another spine-chilling appointment – this time coming face-to-face with a regime gunman.
“He asked me for a day off, to give him a sick note to go home and rest because his finger was tremoring on the trigger,” Amir recalls, his own voice trembling and then trailing off.
“What I could see in front of me wasn’t a fascist, orthodox Islamist, or defender of the Iranian government. I saw a hollow person, and this scares me a lot,” he says.
Amir is no longer afraid of the consequences of disobeying the regime though, even if it costs him his life, he says: “Our problem is not fear. Our problem is hope. People are already dead and are dying now. The question is: for what?”

In Lyon, the far right pays tribute to activist and tries to avoid controversy

The instructions had been clear and supposedly strict: to join the march organized on Saturday, February 21, by far right in Lyon, in memory of one of their own – Quentin Deranque, who died a week earlier from injuries sustained during clashes with far-left activists – participants were required to avoid any distinctive signs associated with this political group.
The task was a tough one. No flags other than that of France, no visible significant tattoos, no insults, no provocative behavior, and not even a balaclava or neck gaiter to cover one's face. The local prefecture had set this last condition in order to authorize the march in memory of the 23-year-old man, whose death is still under investigation, with seven people charged.
These dramatic circumstances did not quieten the far right's desire to turn Deranque into a martyr, quite the contrary. To do so, it was essential to avoid any disturbances, any violence. As one of the organizers put it during the march, half-joking and half-serious: "We're the good guys."
In the early afternoon, several hundred activists from the radical sphere were the first to gather at Place Jean-Jaurès, in lyon 7th arrondissement, about one kilometer as the crow flies from the spot where, nine days earlier, Deranque, separated from his group after clashes, was beaten with horrific violence while he was on the ground, the blows resulting in his death two days later.

LUGANSK, February 22. /TASS/. Two drones of the Ukrainian army have attacked an oil depot in southern Lugansk, injuring a security guard, head of the Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR) Leonid Pasechnik said, adding that the fuel tank was damaged and a fire occurred.
"The Ukrainian Nazis cannot accept their defeats on the battlefield and continue to attack civilian cities. Early this morning, the enemy attacked Lugansk. Two UAVs struck an oil depot in the southern part of the city. Unfortunately, a security guard at the depot was injured," he wrote on his channel in the Max messenger.
The fuel tank was damaged and a fire occurred, Pasechnik added. "Emergency services are taking necessary measures to eliminate the incident. Investigators from the Investigative Committee of Russia for the LPR are documenting the aftermath of the enemy's attack," he said.

Report: amid threat of US war and protests, Khamenei hands Iran’s reins to top adviser

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei turned in early January to longtime ally Ali Larijani to steer the country amid nationwide protests and the threat of U.S. military strikes, The New York Times reported Sunday, citing interviews with senior Iranian officials and members of the Revolutionary Guards.
According to the report, Larijani, 67, a former Revolutionary Guards commander and veteran politician who now heads the Supreme National Security Council, has effectively been running the country in recent months. His rise has sidelined President Masoud Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon turned politician who has publicly downplayed his political role, saying, “I’m a doctor, not a politician,” and cautioning that he cannot solve all of Iran’s problems.
The Times report is based on interviews with six senior Iranian officials, including one affiliated with Khamenei’s office; three members of the Revolutionary Guards; and two former Iranian diplomats, as well as Iranian media accounts. The officials and Guards members spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
According to those sources, Khamenei instructed Larijani and a small circle of political and military confidants to ensure that the Islamic Republic could survive not only potential U.S. and Israeli airstrikes, but also the possible assassination of its top leadership, including Khamenei himself.
Nasser Imani, a conservative analyst close to the government, told the newspaper that Khamenei has a long and close relationship with Larijani.
“The supreme leader fully trusts Larijani,” Imani said in a telephone interview from Tehran. “He believes Larijani is the man for this sensitive juncture because of his political track record, sharp mind and knowledge. He relies on him for reports on the situation and pragmatic advice. Larijani’s role will be very pronounced during war.”
The report said Iran’s leadership is operating on the assumption that U.S. military strikes are inevitable, even as diplomatic contacts over a possible nuclear deal continue. Iran has placed its armed forces on the highest state of alert and is preparing to resist any attack, according to the officials and Guards members cited.
Iran has positioned ballistic missile launchers along its western border with Iraq, within range of Israel, and along its southern coast on the Persian Gulf, within range of U.S. bases and other regional targets, the report said. In recent weeks, Iran has periodically closed its airspace to test missiles and conducted military exercises in the Persian Gulf, briefly shutting the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global energy corridor.
Khamenei has also issued a series of internal directives aimed at ensuring continuity of governance. According to the report, he has designated four layers of succession for military and government posts he personally appoints, instructed senior officials to name up to four replacements and delegated authority to a tight circle of aides in case communications are disrupted or he is killed.
While in hiding during the 12-day war with Israel last summer, Khamenei named three potential successors, though their identities were not made public. Larijani is almost certainly not among them because he is not a senior Shiite cleric, a requirement for the role of supreme leader, the report said.
Still, Larijani is part of Khamenei’s inner circle, which includes Maj. Gen. Yahya Rahim Safavi, the supreme leader’s top military adviser and former commander of the Revolutionary Guards; Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, designated to lead Iran’s armed forces in wartime; and Ali Asghar Hejazi, Khamenei’s chief of staff.
Some of the planning reflects lessons drawn from Israel’s surprise strike in June that killed senior members of Iran’s military command in the opening hours of the conflict, according to the report. After the ceasefire, Khamenei appointed Larijani to his current post and established a new National Defense Council to oversee wartime military affairs.
“Khamenei is dealing with the reality in front of him,” Vali Nasr, an Iran expert at Johns Hopkins University, told the newspaper. “He is expecting to be a martyr and thinking this is my system and legacy, and I will stand until the end. He is distributing power and preparing the state for the next big thing, both succession and war, aware that succession may come as a consequence of war.”
In the event of war with the United States and Israel, special police units, intelligence agents and Basij militia forces would be deployed in major cities to prevent domestic unrest and identify suspected foreign operatives, according to the officials cited.
The report also said Iranian leaders are weighing contingency plans for political survival if senior figures are killed, including who would manage the country in such a scenario. Larijani is said to top that list, followed by Ghalibaf and former President Hassan Rouhani.
Larijani’s public profile has risen sharply in recent weeks. He has traveled to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin, met regional leaders and overseen nuclear negotiations with Washington. He has also appeared frequently in Iranian media and on social platforms, often more prominently than the president.
Meanwhile, Pezeshkian has appeared to defer to Larijani. According to Iranian media cited by the Times, the president told a cabinet meeting that he had to appeal to Larijani to lift internet restrictions that were harming e-commerce.
The report also described contacts between Washington and Tehran during the unrest. In January, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff sought to reach Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, after President Donald Trump warned that the United States would strike Iran if it executed protesters. Araghchi reportedly sought authorization from Pezeshkian to engage, but the president directed him to obtain approval from Larijani instead, underscoring Larijani’s central role.
Iran’s leadership has publicly denied seeking war but has vowed to respond forcefully to any attack. “We are not looking for war, and we won’t start the war,” Larijani said in an interview with Al Jazeera during a visit to Doha. “But if they force it on us, we will respond.”

What send reforms are expected to be brought in by the government - and will Labour MPs back it?
A total overhaul of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system is due to be unveiled on Monday in a schools white paper that could face major opposition from Labour MPs.
The changes will raise the bar at which children in England qualify for an education, health and care plan (EHCP), which legally entitles children with Send to get support. EHCPs will be reserved for children with the most severe and complex needs, but new plans for children on lower tiers will still confer additional support and legal rights.
Parents would have legal avenues for appeals under existing equalities legislation and through the tribunal, said sources with knowledge of the proposed new system.
The Send system overhaul is seen as the most high-stakes policy change the government has taken on since welfare, when plans had to be abandoned after a Labour backbench rebellion. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, has been leading a year-long lobbying offensive of hundreds of MPs, with many expressing support and recognition that the system has to change.
But some in government are worried that Labour MPs could vote the plans down in the next parliamentary session if MPs are bombarded with opposition from parents.
Phillipson has said children with Send would “always have a legal right to support”, and Labour would “not just protect but improve that support”. Sources said the old system was broken and, if legislation is successful, those children currently in year 2 with an EHCP would be assessed by schools to decide if they need to remain on a EHCP or their needs could be met “in a more flexible way”.

Ministers 'not ruling anything out' on Andrew, education secretary says
The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles’s brother,from the line of royal succession.
Andrew was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Police took him to Aylsham police station in Norfolk for questioning about allegations he shared confidential material with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Despite being stripped of his title last year, Andrew is still eighth in line to the throne and an act of parliament would be required to remove him and prevent him from ever becoming king.
Asked by Sky News’ Trevor Phillips when the public can expect to see draft legislation excluding Andrew from the line of succession, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson,said:
So we’re not ruling anything out around this. But we have obviously got a live police investigation under way, so we’ll not be setting out further steps until the police have been able to do their work. And wherever that investigation, wherever the evidence takes them.
Asked if the government is advising King Charles to remove Andrew from the privy council, she said:
So we’ve said that we have to keep all of these options available to us, but you’ll appreciate that because we have a live police investigation under way it’s right that the police are allowed to do their job. Once that is concluded, then of course we’ll consider in discussion with the royal family, with the King what further action is needed.
But I do just think as well, in all of this, we really shouldn’t lose sight of where this began. And where this began was with young women and girls being exploited over an extended period of time by a network of very powerful men. And we can’t ever forget that.
Parents find prospect of reassessment of educational support 'genuinely frightening', shadow education secretary says
The shadow education secretary, Laura Trott, told the BBC that the Conservatives would oppose any special educational needs (Send) support being withdrawn after children’s needs are reviewed.
Trott said:
I think that we want to be really constructive where it comes to this. But I do have some big concerns about what is being floated. Obviously, we’ll see the detail tomorrow. But for too many parents … they’ve had to fight for the support and the idea that they’re going to be reassessed will be genuinely frightening. And I do worry about that …
It hasbeen way too hard for many parents to get that support. But oncethat support is in place for many young people that has actually been very effective. So it’s important that that is not taken away.
And the stress that this system has meant for so many parents up and down the country, they’ve been worried for about a year now because there was a leak that EHCP’s were going to be taken away. Now we’ve got the education secretary on here saying that they might be reviewed. I mean, it’s just too much for parents. They need to just take away this anxiety. And we would absolutely oppose any support being withdrawn.
As we have been reporting, one of the key pillars of the government’s school reforms will be reducing the reliance of children with Send on education, health and care plans (EHCP), which are legal documents that enshrine support for children and young adults up to the age of 25. Councils and charities that provide Send support are struggling with staffing and funding as demand has spiralled upwards.
The provision across the country is extremely patchy, with some parents having to battle local authorities through protracted tribunals to get the right support for their child’s needs. Some have voiced fears about plans to test those who hold ECHPs according to tougher criteria when they move up to secondary school.

You can read the full story by my colleagues, Alexandra ToppingandRichard Adams,here:
Speaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg on her Sunday politics programme, the education secretary Bridget Phillipson claimed that Send reforms will “transform support for children and families”.
Phillipson was pressed over whether any child who currently receives support will lose it under the reforms due to be set out in the white paper tomorrow morning (see opening post for more details).
“We are not going to be taking away effective support from children, and what I’ll be setting out tomorrow is a decade long, very careful transition from the system that we have, which everyone recognises isn’t working.”
Kuenssberg questioned the term “effective support”, pointing out that this isn’t the same as saying no child who receives support won’t lose it under the government reforms, something many parents fear. Phillipson said:
Children will be reviewed in terms of their needs assessed. That should be happening at the moment. We’re meant to have a system where every year an EHCP is reviewed. That doesn’t always happen, and where it does, it doesn’t always work well.
But what parents will see when we set out our vision tomorrow is a system where if, for example, your child needs speech and language support, the school will be better able to provide that than is the case right now.
The education secretary is asked about the growing anger of the cost of student loans which has escalated since the chancellor’s decision last November to freeze the salary threshold for “plan 2” student loan repayments for three years.
Rachel Reeves said the salary at which plan 2 student loans must be paid back would be frozen at £29,385 for three years starting from next April. It means borrowers will have to pay even more towards their student loans as they benefit from pay rises.
Interest on the loans is charged at the rate of RPI inflation plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns. The Tories, which introduced the loans in the coalition government, have now promised to limit the rate on the loans to the retail price index (RPI) in a move that will heap further pressure on the Treasury.
Asked on Sky News how she will help loan 2 graduates saddled with huge amounts of debts, Phillipson said:
Now I get the problem. I see the issue. In reality, as a government, you have to look at a question of priorities and what you can do and how fast you can do it. Given the shape of what we have in the public finances, this is really hard.
Phillipson said she is bringing in maintenance grants for less well-off students. “The threshold for repayment is going up this year. It will then, in future years, be frozen.”
Parents will get educational support for their child within 'weeks', not months or years, education secretary says
Bridget Phillipson is asked about the government’s school reforms, namely around those concerning children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) in England.
Trevor Phillips points out to her that there are 1.7 million children with special educational needs, nearly 500,000 of whom are school pupils. He says the proportion of children with education, health and care (EHCP) plans – which identify a child’s needs and set out the support they should receive – has been increasing. He asks why this may be and Phillipson replies:
Part of what we’ve seen is that support for children with Send has been treated almost as an entirely separate issue, rather than it being integral to our school system. Lots of children at some point during their school lives will experience some form of challenge, will need extra support.
But the system that we have at the moment… is one that has made it the case that in order to get the support that children need, parents have to fight really hard to get that education, health and care plan. I’ve heard from so many parents just how difficult, how devastating that has been. It can take years. It’s really adversarial.
Pressed by Trevor Phillips if the government is promising that an EHCP determination will be delivered within weeks, not months or years, Phillipson said:
Yes. We will make sure that children get support much, much more quickly than is the case right now. And the commitment that I give to parents is that when they see all of the documents published tomorrow what they will see is a government that is focused on delivering better outcomes for their children. I am fiercely ambitious for every child in our country.
Phillipson later confirmed it will become “a question of weeks, not a question of months and years”. Many EHCPS are issued by local authorities beyond the 20 week deadline.
Education secretary to face questions as government sets out plans to halve attainment gap in England’s schools
Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, will be speaking to the BBC and Sky News shortly and will likely be asked about government plans to halve the attainment gap between the poorest pupils in England and their more affluent peers.
The schools white paper, set to be published in full tomorrow, will set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born in this parliament finish secondary school.
It will detail proposals to change the criteria under which schools receive funding to support the most disadvantaged students, and will set out two new programmes to tackle performance of disadvantaged pupils locally in the North East and on the coast.
In the latest GCSE results, the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to the Department for Education (DfE).
It had previously narrowed from 4.07 in 2011 to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between. It then widened again post-pandemic to the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94 in 2022/23.
Phillipson, a Sunderland MP who grew up in the north-east, said the reforms will help end the “one-size-fits-all system” and present a “golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success”.
The schools white paper will also reportedly set out proposals to transform the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system, in what could be one of the defining policy challenges of Keir Starmer’s fragile administration.
Children with a legal right to special needs support will face a review when they move to secondary school, my colleagues Alexandra Topping andRichard Adams report.
The reforms will raise the bar at which children in England qualify for an education, health and care plan (EHCP), which legally entitles children with Send to get support.

Swiss pop art pioneer Peter Stämpfli dies
Swiss artist Peter Stämpfli died on Friday at the age of 88. This was announced by his Parisian gallery Georges-Philippe & Nathalie Vallois.

Born in Deisswil, canton Bern, in 1937, Stämpfli was known in particular for his works with car tyres, the French news agency AFP wrote on Saturday.
Stämpfli trained at the Biel School of Applied Arts and began exhibiting in numerous galleries in the 1960s. He left Switzerland for France in 1959 and later lived in Switzerland several times.
Over the years, his works have been included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. “What characterised me was the desire to isolate the object against a white background. To remove it from its history, from its context,” he explained in 2018 on the occasion of an exhibition at Galerie Vallois.

Peter Stämpfli: the tyre as a life’s work
In addition to sculpting, Stämpfli also devoted himself to filmmaking, in particular making short films. According to the SIKART encyclopaedia of art in Switzerland, Stämpfli belongs to the generation of artists closely associated with pop art on the one hand and minimal art and conceptual art on the other. However, despite all the similarities, it is obvious that Stämpfli is not at home in any of these art movements, but rather moves in a border area in which he develops his ideas of object, structure and space, it said.
In 1967, Stämpfli represented Switzerland at the 9th São Paulo Biennale in Brazil and in 1970 at the 35th Venice Biennale.

SQ flights to and from New York cancelled as ‘super bomb’ blizzard aims heavy snow at US north-east
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Across New York City and the North-east, 30 million people in the US are under blizzard warnings from a powerful winter storm that threatens to drop heavy, wet wind-blown snow by the foot starting from Feb 22 and has already grounded more than 1,000 flights.
All kinds of travel are expected to be near impossible, and the system may lead to widespread power outages.
The National Weather Service updated its forecast on the afternoon of Feb 21, calling for a long stretch along the East Coast to get up to 50.8cm. Mayor Zohran Mamdani warned New Yorkers the blizzard may be more dangerous than a storm that hit the city in late January
“I am asking all New Yorkers to stay inside and stay off the roads for your safety,” Mr Mamdani said at a news conference on Feb 21. “These have the potential to be even more hazardous conditions than we faced the last time around.”
New York subway trains may run with delays and the Long Island Railroad will run on a weekend schedule on Feb 23, Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman Janno Lieber said. New Jersey also declared a state of emergency and Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont urged people to stay off the roads from the night of Feb 22 to the morning of Feb 23.
The blizzard warning stretches from Virginia to Massachusetts, including New York, Newark, Providence and Boston.
More than 1,097 flights for Feb 22 and 23 have been cancelled, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service. The majority are at New York’s airports, along with Boston, Newark and Atlanta.
Singapore Airlines flights to and from New York airports from Feb 22 to Feb 24 are among those that have been cancelled.
The storm is forecast to strengthen so quickly on Feb 22 – with its central pressure, a measure of strength, dropping 24 millibars in 12 hours – that the US Weather Prediction Center is calling it “a super bomb”, said Mr Brian Hurley, a senior branch forecaster at the agency.
“It is a true nor’easter,” Mr Hurley said. “It is going to stay awhile, too. It is going to hang around for much of Monday.”
NYC infrastructure
New York City officials will deploy 2,600 sanitation workers in 12-hour shifts as snowfall begins on the morning of Feb 22, though there “will be no clean-ups over the course of this storm”, Mr Mamdani said.
“Our focus over the course of this storm is not going to be on physical infrastructure,” he said. “It’s going to be on people getting homeless New Yorkers inside.”
With temperatures near freezing, the snow will be wet and heavy. Combined with winds gusting as high as 88.5kmh, it’s almost certain to topple power lines and trees, causing outages.
Ground travel will be dangerous, and the Weather Service warns anyone venturing out to take a survival kit with them.
Amtrak said on Feb 21 that it will make service adjustments to some routes in the North-east Corridor on Feb 22 and 23.
The storm will start as rain in Washington early on Feb 22, before changing to snow there and in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Washington may get about 7.6cm. Snow will start falling in New York late on the morning of Feb 22, and build with intensity with the worst coming overnight into Feb 23.
“Everything will be closed on Monday,” said Mr Frank Pereira, a senior branch forecaster at the Weather Prediction Center. “There will be no Monday morning commute for New York City, Boston and along that whole I-95 corridor.”
Singapore Airlines flight cancellations
Singapore Airlines (SIA) said in an advisory published on Feb 21 that these flights would be cancelled (all times local):
SQ24 departing Singapore for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 22 at 12.10pm
SQ23 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Singapore on Feb 22 at 10.05pm
SQ26 departing Frankfurt for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 22 at 8.35am
SQ25 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Frankfurt on Feb 22 at 8.15pm
SQ24 departing Singapore for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 23 at 12.10pm
SQ23 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Singapore on Feb 23 at 10.05pm
SQ26 departing Frankfurt for New York (John F. Kennedy) on Feb 23 at 8.35am
SQ25 departing New York (John F. Kennedy) for Frankfurt on Feb 23 at 8.15pm
SQ22 departing Singapore for New York (Newark) on Feb 23 at 12.40am
SQ21 departing New York (Newark) for Singapore on Feb 23 at 9.35am
SQ22 departing Singapore for New York (Newark) on Feb 24 at 12.40am
SQ21 departing New York (Newark) for Singapore on Feb 24 at 9.35am
The national carrier said it will contact all affected customers to inform them about the flight cancellations.
As the situation remains fluid, other flights may be affected, it said, advising customers to visit its flight status page for the latest flight information.
Those who have been affected by the flight cancellations will be rebooked on alternative flights, or they can seek a full refund of the unused portion of their ticket.

20,000 troops to patrol Gaza under Trump’s ‘board of peace’ plan
- President Donald Trump has revealed details of his Gaza reconstruction plan, featuring a "board of peace" and an initial $7bn (£5.2bn) fund from various nations.
- A key element is the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force, led by a US general, with Indonesia pledging 8,000 troops out of a total 20,000 soldiers.
- The plan's success relies on the disarmament of Hamas, which Trump said he group had agreed to.
- The "board of peace" comprises numerous Middle Eastern and other nations, but notably excludes Palestinian representatives and major Western allies such as the UK, EU, France, and Germany.
- Concerns include the board's perceived colonial structure, the lack of Palestinian input, and the significant shortfall in funding compared to the estimated $70bn required for Gaza's full reconstruction.

Ruth Langsford shares nightmare Strictly experience that caused panic attack
‘I had a deep sense of dread in the pit of my stomach,’ the ‘Loose Women’ star said of nerve-inducing moment
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Ruth Langsford has opened up about a nightmare Strictly Come Dancing experience that left her suffering a panic attack on live television.
The former This Morning host was a contestant on the BBC competition in 2017, performing with former professional-turned-judge Anton Du Beke.
But Langsford developed an intense case of stage fright in the first live show, which prompted Du Beke to take her to the studio canteen to assure her she would be OK.
”As time passed, my nerves got worse and worse, and I had a deep sense of dread in the pit of my stomach,” she explained in an extract from her new memoir, obtained by MailOnline.
Langsford said her “brain seemed to detach” from her body” as she walked down the stairs to get on the dance floor to perform a waltz to “This Was Nearly Mine" from the musical South Pacific.
“I was aware of just how many people were in the studio. I live and breathe live television so that wasn’t a problem, but I had never performed in front of a big audience before and I swear I could see the whites of their eyes.”
She continued: “I couldn’t move and I felt dizzy. I had no saliva in my mouth, so my smile was more of a grimace with my lips stuck to my teeth. My heart was beating so loudly I could hear it in my ears, and I was convinced the audience would be able to hear it, too.
At this stage, Langsford thought: “I am going to faint. Right here, on Strictly. A live show. Nobody has ever done that before. Maybe they’ll cut the cameras or focus on the judges?”
Her then-husband Eamonn Holmes was in the audience, and he realised something was wrong. “Unbeknownst to me, at that moment Eamonn turned to Jack and said: ‘I think she’s in trouble.’ He could tell from my wide-eyed stare.”
Langsford described the dance as “an out-of-body experience” and said that Du Beke carried her around “like a rag doll”. She said it was much later that she realised she’d had a panic attack.
“If that was my first time and I was convinced I was going to die of nerves, how could I do this every week? Anton was going to hate me. I was going to hate me,” she said.
“What I realised in hindsight was that I had suffered a panic attack, not something I’d ever experienced before.”
Langsford, who received 16 out of 40 points for the dance, made it through to week eight of that year’s series, which saw Holby City actor Joe McFadden lift the Glitterball trophy. Du Beke replaced Bruno Toniolo as a full-time judge on the series in 2021.
In 2025, reality star Vicky Pattinson admitted she almost let her nerves about taking part on the show prevent her from becoming a contestant.
She told her fans: “I knew before Strictly even started I was going to struggle with my nerves and anxiety... so much so, that I almost said no to this incredible opportunity. I almost let my fear stop me from doing something amazing.”
“But I absolutely don't want that nasty little inner critic to dictate my life.. I don't want it to convince me that I'm not capable of doing brilliant things once in a while.”
Pattinson finished in eighth place on the show, which was ultimately won by Lioness Karen Carney.

Israeli army launches airstrikes, artillery shelling on Gaza despite ceasefire
Israeli forces committed hundreds of violations, killing 612, injuring 1,640 others since Oct. 10, 2025, Gaza’s Health Ministry says
GAZA CITY, Palestine
The Israeli army carried out airstrikes and artillery shelling across various parts of the Gaza Strip early Sunday, despite a ceasefire agreement in force.
Israeli warplanes targeted eastern areas of the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, eyewitnesses told Anadolu.
Israeli military vehicles also opened fire on the eastern areas of Khan Younis in the south, while naval forces fired toward the city’s coastline, according to the witnesses.
In Gaza City, Israeli fighter jets carried out airstrikes on eastern areas, accompanied by sporadic artillery shelling on the same locations, eyewitnesses said.
A US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 612 Palestinians and injuring 1,640 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Report: Khamenei hands effective control of Iran to Ali Larijani
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
09:01:05 UTC
18:01:05 KST

In early January, as Iran grappled with nationwide protests, Khamenei turned to a trusted deputy to steer the country through the crisis: Ali Larijani, one of the Islamic Republic's most senior national security figures.
Since then, Larijani, 67, a veteran politician and former commander in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has been effectively running the country. He currently heads the Supreme National Security Council. His rise has pushed aside Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon turned politician, who has endured a challenging first year in office and has publicly remarked, "I am a doctor, not a politician," saying he should not be expected to solve Iran's many problems.
The account of Larijani's ascent and of the deliberations within Iran's leadership, as President Donald Trump's administration threatens war, is based on interviews with six senior Iranian officials, including one affiliated with Khamenei's office; three members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; two former Iranian diplomats; and reports in Iranian media.
Khamenei instructed Larijani and several of his close allies in the political and military establishment to ensure that the Islamic Republic survives not only potential US and Israeli bombing, but also any attempt to assassinate its senior leadership, including Khamenei himself, the six officials and Guard members said.
Nasser Imani, a conservative analyst close to the government, said in a telephone interview from Tehran that Khamenei has maintained a long and close relationship with Larijani and turned to him at this critical moment of military and security crisis.
"The Supreme Leader has no doubt in his complete trust in Larijani. He believes Larijani is the right man for this sensitive juncture because of his political record, sharp intellect and knowledge," Imani said. "He relies on him for situation reports and pragmatic advice. Larijani's role will be especially prominent in wartime."
According to six senior Iranian officials, Khamenei has issued a series of directives in the event that any top-ranking official is harmed. He has designated four layers of successors for every military and governmental position that he personally appoints. He has also instructed all senior officeholders to name up to four replacements and has delegated authority to a small circle of trusted loyalists to make decisions should contact with him be severed or if he is killed.
While in hiding during the 12-day war with Israel last June, Khamenei selected three candidates who could succeed him. Their names have never been made public. However, it can be said with certainty that Ali Larijani is not among them, as he is not a senior Shiite cleric, a basic requirement for any potential successor.
Nevertheless, Larijani has for years been considered part of Khamenei's inner circle of loyal supporters. That circle includes his senior military adviser and former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Yahya Rahim Safavi; Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, a former Guards commander and current parliament speaker, whom Khamenei appointed as a kind of deputy to command the armed forces during the war; and his chief of staff, cleric Ali Asghar Hejazi.
Part of this planning stems from lessons learned from the 12-day war, which wiped out Iran's senior military chain of command in its opening hours. After the ceasefire, Khamenei appointed Larijani as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and established a new national security council, headed by Ali Shamkhani, to manage military affairs during the war.

Hostage Segev Kalfon leads 'Shema Yisrael' cry at Times Square

The moment had been waiting for months. At Chabad's flagship annual youth gathering in New York – the event that fills Times Square with the sound of a generation – hostage survivor Segev Kalfon took the stage Saturday and cried out "Shema Yisrael." Standing beside him was fellow freed hostage Matan Zangauker. The 4,578 young Jewish voices that had packed Manhattan's iconic square joined the declaration in a roar that seemed to shake the plaza.
Kalfon was abducted on October 7 and held for months before his release from Hamas captivity. He had spoken before about his intention to recite the prayer the moment he was free. Saturday night, he made good on it.
The occasion was the opening of CTeen's 900th branch – a milestone that brought thousands of teens from 60 countries to New York. But celebration was not the only note of the evening. Young people from the Bondi community took the stage to speak about loss. Their community had been shattered by a shooting attack during last Hanukkah that killed 15 of its members, among them Rabbi Eli Shlanger – the Chabad emissary who had built the local youth branch from scratch just months before his murder.
Rabbi Shlanger's daughter, Priva, addressed the crowd, speaking about the mission her father had left unfinished but not abandoned. Footage of the Bondi teens – raw, unfiltered testimony about the moments of horror and the long road since – played on the event's giant screens. What came through, again and again, was not despair but a fierce, almost defiant pride: "We will keep being Jewish, loudly and proudly."
Rabbi Menachem Kutlarski, the chairman of Chabad Youth Worldwide, told the crowd that "darkness will not have the last word," and announced that a new youth center in Sydney would carry Rabbi Shlanger's name forward.
The youth Shabbaton, now in its 18th year, had drawn teens from 486 cities worldwide to New York. They had spent Shabbat together in Crown Heights, and the Times Square event served as the culmination of the gathering.

Less snow, or more risk? What you need to know about avalanches and climate change
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
09:00:33 UTC
18:00:33 KST

Avalanches kill about 100 people in Europe each year, with vast masses of ice, snow and rock regularly crashing down on hikers and skiers who have been caught unawares.
The structure of the snow, angle of the slope and variation of the weather can dictate whether a gentle disturbance – like a gust of wind or the glide of a snowboard – can trigger a deadly shift in the mountain.
How dangerous are avalanches? Experts say the risks of an avalanche should be thought of like a flood: you have to consider both the chance of the hazard and the damage it will do.
“Avalanche risk in the European Alps is nowadays mostly for mountain practitioners who trigger avalanches themselves,” said Nicolas Eckert, a climatologist specialising in mountain risk at Université Grenoble Alpes. “However, such accidental avalanches are only a small portion of the total number of avalanches.”
Avalanche hazard levels are particularly high after heavy snowfall, and weather conditions earlier in the winter can prove decisive to the strength of the snow.
“Limited early‑season snowfall can lead to the formation of persistent weak layers within the snowpack,” said Giacomo Strapazzon, a medical doctor and director of the Mountain Clinic at the Institute of Mountain Emergency Medicine. “Once these weak layers become buried under subsequent snowfalls, they can create highly unstable conditions that favour human‑triggered avalanches.”
Experts say the danger is compounded because many people engaging in winter sports recreationally are unfamiliar with warning bulletins and fail to adjust their behaviour accordingly.
Are avalanches getting more deadly? Each year, about 100 people die in avalanches in Europe – a trend that scientists have found to have stayed broadly steady over the last four decades. Fatalities fell slightly in 2023-24, when 87 people died, and again in 2024-25, when 70 people died. European Avalanche Warning Services (EAWS) had already recorded 99 deaths by the middle of February 2026.
Experts say exposure to avalanches has been rising with an increase in the number of off-track skiers, who are exposed to greater danger than those on controlled tracks. But this shift has not resulted in a rise in deaths because it has been compensated by better warnings, safety equipment and – in recent years – stable snow conditions.
“Overall, we have seen a slight decline in the annual number of fatalities, despite a massive increase in the number of ski touring days undertaken in Switzerland,” said Kurt Winkler, a scientist at the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Switzerland. “This massive decrease in risk cannot be explained by climate change. Other factors, such as faster rescue operations and better avalanche forecasts, appear to be far more important.”
Is climate change making avalanches worse? Ski resorts across the continent have begun to close due to a lack of snow, with half of Europe’s 2,200 ski resorts projected to suffer “very high risk” to snow supply if global warming hits 2C above pre-industrial levels. Studies suggest climate change will make avalanches smaller and less common, as rising temperatures melt snow and shorten the season.
“However, due to the higher water-holding capacity of warmer air, heavy snowfall events might increase in magnitude – especially at high elevations,” said Elias Zubler from Switzerland’s Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology. “The model projections show a general decrease in the frequency of heavy snowfall events, but an intensification of events is possible, especially at high elevations and in the core winter season.”
Such a rise in high-elevation avalanches could pose a serious risk to skiers, who make up most of the deaths, and mountaineers. Climate change is also likely to result in a higher share of avalanches with snow that is wet and dense, allowing them to pack more punch.

Wer gewinnt Rheinland-Pfalz? Alexander Schweitzer im Gespräch

In der rheinland-pfälzischen Landeshauptstadt Mainz bereitet sich Alexander Schweitzer auf seine erste Bewährungsprobe als gewählter Regierungschef vor. Es ist ein Spiel gegen die Zeit und gegen den Bundestrend, bei dem der SPD-Ministerpräsident auf die Karte des regionalen Pragmatismus setzt. Während die Bundespolitik in Berlin oft von schrillen Tönen geprägt ist, kultiviert Schweitzer auch im Wahlkampf bis zum 22. März das Image einer soliden, fast schon demonstrativ unaufgeregten Regierungsarbeit als Markenkern. Um die jahrzehntelange Vorherrschaft seiner Partei an Rhein und Mosel gegen eine erstarkende CDU zu verteidigen.
Im Gespräch mit Alexander Schweitzer geht es um das Spannungsfeld zwischen sozialdemokratischen Gerechtigkeitsfragen und der notwendigen Nähe zum Mittelstand. Er skizziert seine Vision einer Erbschaftsteuer, die extrem vermögende Dynastien stärker in die Pflicht nimmt, ohne dabei das Rückgrat der heimischen Wirtschaft zu gefährden. Dabei wird deutlich, wie sehr der „rheinland-pfälzische Weg“ auf persönlichem Vertrauen und einer bewussten Abgrenzung vom Berliner Polit-Chaos fußt, wobei Schweitzer auch für unkonventionellen Allianzen und um liberale Wähler wirbt.

Swiss chosen to develop four museums in Benin

Swiss chosen to develop four museums in Benin
Swiss palaeontologist Jacques Ayer has been appointed by the government of Benin as managing director of four new public museums that will showcase Beninese art, culture and history.
Jacques Ayer, a palaeontologist from canton Fribourg, couldn’t have been more surprised by his appointment as managing director of the Réunion des Musées publics (RMP, a consortium of public museums) in Benin, West Africa.
This monumental project involves four museums currently under construction in four cities: the Musée international de la Mémoire de l’Esclavage (international museum of the memory of slavery) in Ouidah, dedicated to the history of the slave trade in the 17th and 18th centuries; the Musée des Rois et des Amazones du Dahomey (museum of kings and Amazons of Dahomey) in Abomey, which will restore the city’s royal palaces; the Musée international du Vodun (international Vodun museum) in Porto-Novo, which will focus on Benin’s religious heritage and Africa’s Vodun communities; and the Musée d’art contemporain (contemporary art museum) in Cotonou, to promote Beninese and other African artists working today.
Ayer was appointed by Benin’s council of ministers at the recommendation of the country’s president, Patrice Talon. Now based in Cotonou, the country’s economic capital, Ayer began his new job in January. He has until 2029 to complete his ambitious work on the museums.
Eclectic background
Ayer comes well prepared for the job ahead. A palaeontologist by training, with a master’s degree in geology from the University of Neuchâtel, he has “been around the block a few times”, as he puts it.
From 1994 to 2004, he was the curator of the Earth sciences department at the Muséum d’histoire naturelle (museum of natural history) in Neuchâtel. He then ran the Jurassica Museum in Porrentruy, canton Jura, before directing the Muséum d’histoire naturelle in Geneva from 2012 to 2020.
Just over four years ago, he established his own consulting firm called Muséolis, based in Geneva. This allows him to develop museum projects, for which he can draw on 30 years of experience and contacts.
“My eclectic profile worked in my favour with the Beninese government,” Ayer says. “In addition, there’s my personal interest in Africa. My wife is originally from Nigeria. She’s not involved in setting up the RMP, but she opened my eyes to the question of African heritage quite a while ago.”

Africa’s relevance is growing – and everyone wants in
Ayer’s passion for African art is a huge asset. But he is not from Benin. It was unclear whether the Beninese would approve of a European at the head of a national project focused on the country’s heritage.
“I have to admit that I received a very warm welcome,” Ayer says. “But the reactions online were mixed. Some people were surprised by my appointment, but never opposed.” He adds that “these four institutions must be established rapidly, under optimal conditions. And Benin does not yet have much experience in this area. With this large-scale project, the country is acting as a pioneer in Africa. It therefore needed technical assistance and practical skills to ensure that the museums are developed in a way that is lasting”.
A pioneering project
That said, Ayer does not intend to import a Western model of museum science to Benin, which, as he points out, would not necessarily meet the expectations of the local population. “My goal,” he says, “is to create a model here that incorporates African artistic sensibilities”.
He cites the future Musée international du Vodun as an example. “It will allow us to highlight art used mainly for religious or social rituals and therefore deeply rooted in local traditions. I plan to restore the original function of these works. So there’s no question of enclosing them in glass cases, as is the custom in Europe. You could imagine, for example, creating historical tours for the public through certain villages in the country where these items are still used in ceremonies.”

Looted colonial art: ‘There are no limits to restitution’
Before Ayer arrived in Cotonou, Beninese religious institutions, historians, and scientists had already started examining how to promote the country’s heritage. “What I can add to this,” Ayer says, “is my experience in strategy and operations. In short, establishing an organisational framework”.
As he is eager to strengthen cultural programmes and foster interaction with the public, he is planning educational workshops for museum staff that provide suitable training in the arts. Ayer believes that knowledge transfer is essential. “It’s very important to think of my mission as transitional. The field of museum science is complex, so I want to prepare the future management personnel, to train them so they can take full ownership of the artistic projects after I leave,” he explains.
Creating partnerships
Ayer believes cultural exchange is another important element of this training. He sees in Benin an admirable openness and flexibility. “It’s an asset that will allow me to create partnerships with Swiss museums and even to consider university exchanges,” he says. These would allow Swiss art students to benefit from organised programmes in Benin. In turn, Beninese students wishing to enrich their education could spend time in Switzerland. “We mustn’t forget that our country has some great innovative institutions,” Ayer says.
The RMP will also create new opportunities for the restitution of Beninese art stolen during the colonial era. “Switzerland is a springboard for my contacts with Europe. I will apply all of my expertise in the service of cultural cooperation between the ‘old continent’ and Benin,” he says.
In 2021, France returned 26 of Abomey’s royal treasures to Benin. “They represent only a tiny fraction of the Beninese and African heritage still held in Europe. The 26 treasures will be exhibited in the future Musée des Rois et des Amazones du Dahomey,” Ayer says. “The RMP will, I hope, give European countries a sense of security when they recognise the capacity of Benin’s institutions to house works of art under excellent conditions.”

Dog abandoned at airport check-in finds forever home with officer who rescued him
A dog that was abandoned at an airport check-in counter has been adopted by the police officer who rescued him.
The pooch, nicknamed "Jet Blue," was found tied to a baggage sizer at Harry Reid International Airport on 2 February.
Police said the owner had not completed the required paperwork to travel with the dog as a service animal and was denied a boarding pass before leaving the dog behind and going to the departure gate.
The woman was subsequently arrested and booked for animal abandonment and resisting arrest, authorities added.
Animal Protective Services took in Jet Blue, but his owner never returned. A rescue charity then stepped in.
In an update on 21 February, Las Vegas police said Officer Skeeter Black's family was selected as Jet Blue's new forever home, having already been approved months ago.

UK Should Send Non-Combat Troops to Ukraine ‘Now’ – Boris Johnson

Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called for UK and allied troops to be deployed to Ukraine in non-combat roles “now.”
Interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg alongside Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, Johnson also remarked that Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been prevented if Western allies had paid closer attention to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s increasing aggression, and the precedent set by the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.

“If we can have boots on the ground after the war, after Putin has condescended to have a ceasefire, then why not do it now?” Johnson said.
“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?” he emphasized, warning that if Ukraine were to become a “vassal state of Russia,” it would become Putin’s decision who comes to the country, but that – right not – “it’s up to the Ukrainians.”
The former UK prime minister’s comments come in the wake of UK Defence Secretary John Healey saying he would send British troops to Ukraine once the warring countries had reached a peace deal.
Johnson and Radakin agreed that the West had been too slow and cautious in providing support to Ukraine, including supplies of vital weapons, with Radakin describing the approach taken as “incrementalism” and acknowledging frustration on the part of Kyiv.
Russia Launches Overnight Missile, Drone Assaults on Kyiv, Across Ukraine
Johnson referred to “needless” delays in providing Ukraine with what it needed, pointing out that when Kyiv received what it asked for, it was ultimately to the country’s advantage, putting pressure on Putin.
Responding to the latest comments, a UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We are proud of UK leadership on Ukraine – supporting the fight today and working to secure the peace tomorrow.”
The spokesperson added: “It’s why this government is providing the highest ever level of military support, including a recent half-billion-pound air defence package just last week, accelerating £200 million for the UK military to prepare for any Ukraine deployment, and working with over 30 nations through the UK-led Coalition of the Willing.”
“Tragic”
On whether the full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been prevented, Johnson made clear his view that the West did not take Putin’s machinery of aggression seriously enough and that “the failure to do anything in Crimea was tragic.”
“If we’d had clarity and simplicity about Ukraine, rather than endless fudge and obscurity, we could have saved that, we could have prevented that invasion,” Johnson remarked.
He also cited the West’s “failure in Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons” as a key factor emboldening Putin.
“If we’d had clarity and simplicity about Ukraine, rather than endless fudge and obscurity, we could have saved that, we could have prevented that invasion,” Johnson remarked.
Radakin called on the UK government to “resolve” its promise to spend 3.5% of national income on defense by 2035, noting that while Russia is “weak,” it remains “dangerous.”

Mum issues vaccine plea after daughter’s death from rare measles complication
- Sarah Walton died at 45 from subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE), a rare and devastating brain condition caused by a mutated measles virus.
- She caught measles at 11 months old – too young for the MMR vaccine – and developed SSPE at 25, which gradually robbed her of the ability to walk, talk, and swallow.
- Her mother, Jo Walton, is now urging parents to get their children vaccinated with the MMR jab, stressing that SSPE is a preventable illness that should not be happening in the 21st century.
- Ms Walton said that measles can cause fatal complications, including encephalitis and severe neurological illnesses, and that vaccination can prevent such tragedies.
- This plea comes amidst national concern in the UK over decreased measles vaccine uptake, which has led to a recent outbreak in northeast London.

DHS suspends PreCheck and Global Entry amid government shutdown

A grouping of major US airlines said the US Department of Homeland Security gave travelers scant warning ahead of the temporary suspension of its PreCheck and Global Entry programs from Sunday, amid a shutdown of much of the agency.
The halt in the programs run by the DHS will begin from 6 a.m. ET, after the partial shutdown began last week, following the failure of Republicans and Democrats to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement reforms.
"Airlines for America is deeply concerned that ... the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown," Chief Executive Chris Sununu said.
News of the suspensions came at "extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly," he added in a statement, urging Congress to "get a deal done."
A similar shutdown last fall caused losses of $6.1 billion across the travel industry and related sectors, he said.
"TSA and Customs and Border Protection are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
"We are making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions to mitigate the damage," she added in a DHS statement to Reuters.
DHS redirects staff as programs paused over funding gaps
The pause in programs is among the emergency measures DHS is taking to redirect staffing more than a week after Congress failed to send it more money, the Washington Post said.
PreCheck had more than 20 million active members, the TSA said in 2024, while total vetted airline passengers in the DHS' traveler programs, including Global Entry, exceeded 40 million.
The PreCheck program allows approved passengers through a dedicated, faster security lane at US airports and is designed to reduce wait times and streamline screening.
Global Entry expedites US customs and immigration clearance for pre‑approved, low‑risk international travelers entering the United States.
Sunday's moves follow orders from the Trump administration last week to another constituent of the DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to suspend deployment of aid workers to disaster-affected areas due to the shutdown.

NASA is taking steps to potentially roll back the Artemis II rocket and Orion spacecraft to its Vehicle Assembly Building after observing an interrupted flow of helium, the space agency said on Saturday. "This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window," NASA said.
NASA said it is taking steps to roll back the Artemis II rocket and Orion spacecraft to the Vehicle Assembly Building at the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The agency observed overnight an interrupted flow of helium in the Space Launch System rocket’s interim cryogenic propulsion stage. Helium flow is required for launch.

NASA said on Friday it was targeting March 6 for the launch of four astronauts around the moon and back as part of its Artemis II mission.
The planned Artemis II crew includes three US astronauts - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and a Canadian astronaut, Jeremy Hansen. The mission is poised to be the farthest human flight into space ever, and the first crewed moon mission since the US Apollo program more than half a century ago.
Artemis II is a precursor to NASA's planned astronaut moon landing with Artemis III, which is scheduled for 2028.

Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. is coming out of retirement after his spring exhibition bout with Mike Tyson.
Mayweather, who turns 49 on Tuesday, retired with a perfect 50-0 record after beating MMA star Conor McGregor in August 2017. The fight against Tyson will be his ninth exhibition match since his retirement at age 40.
"I still have what it takes to set more records in the sport of boxing," Mayweather said Friday in a written statement to ESPN. "From my upcoming Mike Tyson event to my next professional fight afterwards, no one will generate a bigger gate, have a larger global broadcast audience and generate more money with each event than my events. And I plan to keep doing it with my global media partner, CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS."
The April 25 exhibition with Tyson reportedly will take place in Africa in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Tyson (50-7), 59, last fought against Jake Paul on Netflix in a global phenomenon on Nov. 15, 2024. Tyson lost the eight-round bout by unanimous decision and hasn't won a fight since Feb. 22, 2003, against Clifford Etienne.
Mayweather comes out of retirement for a new fight
Mayweather won 15 major world championships across five weight classes, with 27 of his 50 wins by knockout.
Richard and Craig Miele, co-founders of promoter CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS, released a written statement on the return of "Money" Mayweather.
"Signing Floyd Mayweather to un-retire after he captures another worldwide audience with his Mike Tyson match-up, highlights our commitment to providing our global audience with the most high-profile fighters in the sport," they said.
"Floyd will once again continue to dominate boxing with the biggest audience and highest gross events of all time, and we are proud and privileged to be able to do so with our global team at CSI Sports/FIGHT SPORTS. We look forward to even more announcements that will excite fans and continue to build the sport in 2026!"

Seven bodies have been found in Lake Baikal in Russia's Siberia after a tour bus carrying eight Chinese tourists plunged into the water when the ice broke as it crossed the frozen lake on Friday, the Russian emergency ministry said.
One of the Chinese tourists who had been on the bus managed to escape, Irkutsk regional governor Igor Kobzev said on the Telegram app, and the region's prosecutor's office said a criminal case had been opened over the incident.

The ministry said rescuers had conducted an inspection of the scene using an underwater camera and that diving operations were planned.
"The depth at the site of the accident is 18 meters (59 feet)," it said in a statement.
Lake Baikal, the world's deepest freshwater lake, located north of Mongolia, is a popular destination for tourists.
Chinese tourism in Russia has soared in recent years amid closer ties between the two neighbors and the introduction of a mutual visa-free travel regime.

Iran may be capable of producing industrial-grade bombs in 'probably a week,' Witkoff says
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
08:55:20 UTC
17:55:20 KST

US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Iran could theoretically be about a week away from being able to enrich its existing uranium to a weaponized level, though the envoy left out that Iran currently has no access to its material, no machines to enrich it, and no weapons program to use it for any operational purpose.
"They're probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material. And that's really dangerous. So they can't have that," Witkoff said in a conversation with host Lara Trump, clearly wanting to highlight the severity of the potential future nuclear issues should Iran rebuild all the other elements of its nuclear program, which were bombed in June 2025.
In June 2025, Israel and the US destroyed Iran's entire fleet of around 20,000 nuclear centrifuge fleet, its entire multifaceted weaponization program, most of its three major nuclear sites, dozens of minor nuclear sites, killed most of its leading nuclear scientists, and caved in portions of its nuclear facilities, making it hard for the Islamic Republic to access its existing enriched uranium.
Prior to June 2025, Iran was a week away from weaponizing its uranium, if it made the decision to do so, and would then have been around three to six months away from being able to implant the uranium in a missile where it would have assembled the components for a nuclear weapon.
That tiny window was deemed as so small (and it had shrunk fast from an original two-year window) that Israeli intelligence no longer believed it would necessarily catch when Iran crossed the threshold for a nuclear bomb if it did not attack earlier.
Currently, Israel and the US believe Iran is at least two years from being able to produce a nuclear weapon, given all of the many items it must rebuild.
However, Witkoff seemed to be focusing on the fact that Iran has shown it can get quite close to the weaponized uranium level to explain why the Trump administration does not want to let it enrich uranium anymore going forward, as Washington starts to lay out more of its potential case for going to war with Tehran.
In the candid interview, Witkoff also said Trump wasn't exactly upset about Tehran's unwillingness to reach a deal, but more "curious."
"I don't want to use the word frustrated," he stated, offering a rare glimpse into Trump's decision-making process on the issue.
"It's curious. He's curious as to why they haven't capitulated ... under this sort of pressure, with the amount of sea power, naval power that we have over there."
Witkoff restated Trump's previous commitment to "zero enrichment" by Tehran in any future deal. "There have been some very hard red lines drawn," he said. Trump, however, is reportedly considering an Iranian proposal that would allow so‑called “token” uranium enrichment.
According to the report, the Trump administration is open to a limited compromise, as long as it can be verified that any uranium enrichment is purely civilian and cannot be used as a stepping‑stone toward nuclear weapons development.
The special envoy also pointed to domestic pressure in Iran as another factor in the administration's decision-making process on Iran. Protests resurfaced on Iranian streets on Saturday as students from several universities across the country rallied against the Islamic regime.
Addressing the exiled crown prince, Reza Pahlavi, and his potential role in a new regime in Iran, Witkoff said Pahlavi "cares about his country" but that at the end of the day, the country's future will depend on "President Trump's policies, not Mr. Pahlavi's policies," adding that Trump "is interested in hearing everyone's views."
BoP funds to get Gaza 'ready for a renaissance'
Witkoff went on to reveal ambitious plans for Gaza’s reconstruction, highlighting the Trump administration's commitment to transform the region with a massive $17 billion investment.
Reflecting on Thursday's inaugural meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace in Washington, Witkoff said it was "uplifting" to see such progress made on Gaza. "Who would ever have thought that we'd get to this place a year ago?" he said in his conversation with host Lara Trump.
The special envoy expressed optimism about the future of the Palestinian enclave following the US-backed ceasefire that took effect on October 10, 2025, and stressed the potential impact that US President Donald Trump's vision could have on the socio-economic recovery of the entire region.
Asked where the newly pledged funds would be directed, Witkoff said they would be used to launch mass housing and transportation projects.
"We're going to be able to clear and demolish all the areas there and get it ready for a renaissance. And I think this is just the beginning, Lara," he said. "I think today it's 17 [billion], tomorrow it could be 34 [billion]," he continued, noting that the future of the Middle East will largely depend on the unfolding situation in Iran.
'It’s a silly war'
Regarding the war in Ukraine, Witkoff emphasized the leadership challenges and territorial disputes that continue to hinder peace talks. "It’s a silly war," Witkoff said, referring to the conflict's focus on territory, despite the significant human toll. He identified the major holdup in the negotiations as territory and security guarantees, as both sides grapple with what Witkoff called “dignity,” a term he questioned in light of the ongoing violence.
Despite these hurdles, Witkoff expressed cautious optimism, noting that efforts to bring the two sides together had yielded positive results. “They don’t seem like they really want to fight with one another,” he said. The special envoy said he hopes that upcoming proposals could finally bridge the gap, potentially leading to a summit between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
'I saw a tear in [Trump's] eye'
Trump's envoy and close friend highlighted the significant role the president has played in shifting international diplomacy. He attributed much of the success of the US peace initiatives to the president’s personal leadership. “What presidency has ever done this much in four years, or even eight years? But he's done it in 11 months,” he said.
Finally, Witkoff spoke about the return of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and the impact that had on the president. “None of them were going to come home without him,” Witkoff argued. "I told this story ... about how the 20 hostage families came in, and I saw a tear in your father-in-law's eye," he added, referencing the family connection between the host and the president.

Two men charged, weapon seized over fatal Bruce Highway crash
Two men have been charged with multiple offences, including firearm possession, as the investigation into a fatal crash on the Bruce Highway at Burpengary last week continues.
The crash killed 26-year-old man Andre Roberts, who was travelling on the highway when his car was struck by an allegedly stolen truck that was travelling southbound on the wrong side of the highway about 10.30pm on Tuesday.
Footage showed several other vehicles were also driving behind the truck at high speed, also on the wrong side. The Hino flat-bed truck crashed into a Honda Accord driven by Roberts – travelling in the correct lane – and caught fire, tragically killing him instantly.
The 46-year-old man driving the Hino remains in a critical condition in hospital.
On Sunday, police also confirmed the Hino truck – initially believed to be an Isuzu – was bearing false numberplates belonging to a different vehicle.
Police said that as part of the investigation, detectives from the Moreton District Criminal Investigation Branch and Homicide Investigation Unit searched a property at Redcliffe on Friday where they found stolen property and a firearm linked to the stolen truck.
“Two men, a 49-year-old and 36-year-old, both from Redcliffe have been charged man with enter premises, unlawful use of a motor vehicle and weapons offences are assisting police with their inquiries,” they said in a statement.
“They are expected to appear in Redcliffe Magistrates Court on 16 March 2026 and continue to assist police with their inquiries.
“Detectives have identified all vehicles involved in the incident and a number of people are assisting police with their inquiries.”
A Ford Ranger had already been identified as the vehicle following the Hino. It was located at a business on Magnesium Street in Narangba about 5.30pm on Wednesday.
A Narangba man was arrested that day in relation to the discovery.
Sections of the highway were closed until about 5am on Wednesday after the devastating crash.

Pakistan launches airstrikes on Afghanistan killing and wounding dozens
Taliban vows to give ‘measured response’ after cross-border firing
- Bookmark

Pakistan has carried out airstrikes on what it described as militant hideouts inside Afghanistan, saying it was a response to cross-border attacks that have killed members of its security forces and civilians.
Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said the strikes hit a religious school and several residential homes, killing and wounding dozens of civilians.
The Taliban-run defence ministry described the action as a “blatant violation of national sovereignty” and said an “appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”.
They added that they considered the act a “a clear breach of international law, the principles of good neighbourliness, and Islamic values”.
Pakistan said it had targeted hideouts belonging to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed militant network responsible for a surge in attacks in Pakistan’s north-west. The military described the operation as “intelligence-based” and said it was aimed at camps used to plan and launch assaults across the border.
The strikes followed a suicide vehicle bombing in Bajaur district on Tuesday that killed 11 Pakistani security personnel and a child, an attack claimed by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
A statement from Pakistan's ministry of information and broadcasting said the country had “conclusive evidence” that militants behind the recent attacks were operating under the direction of “Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
It said the operation targeted seven militant camps and that the Taliban regime “failed to undertake any substantive action” despite Pakistan’s urging.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of its citizens was its priority.
Issuing a strong condemnation of the strikes, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid wrote in a post on X: “Pakistani special military circles have once again trespassed into Afghan territory.”
He said dozens of “civilian compatriots” were injured and killed, including women and children, in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
“Pakistani generals compensate for their country's security weaknesses through such crimes,” he wrote.
Since the Taliban forcibly seized control of Kabul in August 2021, Pakistan has repeatedly accused it of failing to curb TTP fighters who use Afghan territory as a base to organise and launch attacks. Kabul has consistently denied allowing any group to use its soil to threaten other countries.
Hours before the strikes, a suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in Pakistan's northwest, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.
Pakistan's military warned after Saturday’s attack that it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”.
Relations between the two neighbours have been strained since October, when clashes along the border left dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants dead. The escalation came after explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan.
Although a ceasefire brokered by Qatar has largely held, negotiations held in Istanbul in November 2025 failed to produce a formal settlement, leaving ties fragile and tensions unresolved.

Succession rumours swirl as Kim Jong Un’s daughter misses major event
- Kim Jong Un's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, was notably absent from North Korea's key Workers' Party of Korea congress, prolonging uncertainty over the state's succession plans.
- Her non-appearance was significant as South Korea's National Intelligence Service had recently suggested she had entered a “successor-designate stage”.
- Kim Ju Ae, believed to be around 13, has frequently appeared alongside her father at major military parades and public events since November 2022, fuelling succession speculation.
- The South Korean spy agency, initially sceptical, now views her numerous high-profile appearances as an effort to build a narrative for the country to accept its first female leader.
- The congress, North Korea's most important political gathering, opened with Kim Jong-un declaring a “proud period” for the nation, despite the ongoing ambiguity regarding his successor.

Two Aussies in action today
So, there are six events left in the 2026 Winter Olympics, and Aussies are in action in two of them:
- Rosie Fordham is in the women's 50km mass cross-country skiing from 8pm AEDT.
- And, of course, Indra Brown. The 16-year-old is in the women's freeski halfpipe final from 8:40pm AEDT.
Indra Brown shows us something new, but will miss the medals
Huge love for Indra Brown from Eileen Gu at the end of her run.
The Australian 16-year-old pulls out a 1080 for the first time in competition and scores an 87!
She'll finish in fifth spot, jumping up from 10th with that run.
Gu embraces her at the bottom of the pipe, telling her she "did so well" and praises her with a hailing motion as she walks off.
Indra Brown coming up after another Eileen Gu masterclass
My word, Eileen Gu has pulled out another stunning run.
And she improves on her 94.00 from the second run.
It's a 94.75 just to put an exclamation mark on things.
Meanwhile, in the bobsleigh …
What’s the latest with the four man bobsled?

It's still looking decidedly German at the top.

Top skiers going 'a lot bigger' than Brown
Former aerials gold medallist Lydia Lassila is at Livigno and makes a point that the difference at the moment really is the height of the jumps.
She says "it's very tight at the top" and the likes of Eileen Gu, Li Fanghui and Zoe Atkin are "going a lot bigger" than 16-year-old Australian Indra Brown.
"Indra, you've got be proud of her. She's put down two very clean runs, she just does need that amplitude," Lassila says.
Chinese 1-2 after two runs in halfpipe final
Here are the women's halfpipe final standings after two (of three) runs:
- Eileen Gu (CHN) — 94.00
- Li Fanghui (CHN) — 91.50
- Zoe Atkin (GBR) — 90.50
- Amy Fraser (CAN) — 85.00
- Rachael Karker (CAN) — 79.50
- Mischa Thomas (NZ) — 77.75
- Liu Yishan (CHN) — 70.00
- Indra Brown (AUS) — 65.00
- Kate Gray (USA) — 44.50
- Zhang Kexin (CHN) — 26.25
- Svea Irving (USA) — 17.25
Indra Brown improves, but nowhere near the medals
After a 55.50 in the first run, Brown's second is 65.00.
Her tricks and landings are on point, but the judges seem to be whacking her for a lack of amplitude on the jumps.
An amazing run sends Eileen Gu into the lead
The Chinese superstar, after throwing away her first run after losing momentum on her first landing, has got to be up in the medals after this second run.
Huge air, great execution and smooth as butter on the landings.
SHE'S IN FRONT!
94.00!!
Massive score and good luck touching that.
Indra Brown of Australia is up next.
American missing from second run
We've gone straight from Rachael Karker to fellow Canadian Amy Fraser, which means we're missing American Svea Irving.
She took a fall in the first run.
It didn't look too serious, but she's had knee issues in the past (as basically everyone at these Games has). Maybe she's done for the day, or maybe she'll just come back for the third run.
We've got another lost phone
After watching a few phones go flying in the snowboard slopestyle, Kiwi Mischa Thomas has lost hers on the last hit of her second run.
"My phone?" she cries after her run, covering her mouth as she sees where it ended up in the middle of the pipe on the big screen.
It came flying out as she flicked her hips on the last trick, which begs the question: why don't these pockets have zips?
And she didn't improve on her first-run 77.75 allowing Rachael Karker to pass her with a 79.50.
Standings after first (of three) freeski halfpipe final runs
Australian Indra Brown is sixth after the opening run.
- Zoe Atkin (GBR) — 90.50
- Amy Fraser (CAN) — 85.00
- Li Fanghui (CHN) — 81.25
- Mischa Thomas (NZ) — 77.75
- Liu Yishan (CHN) — 70.00
- Indra Brown (AUS) — 55.50
- Kate Gray (USA) — 44.50
- Eileen Gu (CHN) — 30.00
- Zhang Kexin (CHN) — 24.25
- Svea Irving (USA) — 17.25
- Rachael Karker (CAN) — 5.00
Indra Brown is on the board
A clean first run for Australian 16-year-old Indra Brown.
She is aiming to beat Amy Fraser's 85 in first place, but she's only scored 55.50. She's fourth with two riders to go in their first runs.
You could certainly see a massive difference in amplitude between the small and young Brown after Eileen Gu's towering effort even if it was only one jump of note.
Indra Brown in the pipe after Eileen Gu's stumble
The Chinese defending champion hits a massive 900 to start her final, but loses all momentum and that basically ends her run.
Gu constantly does this, stuffing up her first runs and performing under pressure, so don't be surprised to see her come back with a vengeance.
We have our first falls of the halfpipe final
And it's another Canadian, this time Rachael Karker.
She was pretty shaken up after Cassie Sharpe's big stack in qualifying and looks very sore after landing too low on the pipe and going down awkwardly.
And American Svea Irving follows up with another fall, albeit apparently less painful than Karker's.
Irving was the fifth skier and Australian Indra Brown is ninth, so not far away now.
The women's freeski halfpipe final is underway
The conditions are bright, sunny and stunning.
American 19-year-old Kate Gray is first into the pipe.
She scores 44.50, which won't threaten the medals. But this is why they have three runs.
When is Indra Brown competing?
What time, Australian Eastern SUMMER time, will Indra Brown compete?
- Fred
Hi Fred (and a few other commenters),
If you check that pinned post at the top of the blog, you'll see the freeski halfpipe final is set for 8:40pm AEDT (basically now!).
Brown will be ninth in the order.
A cross-country update
We're just over a fifth of the way through the women's 50km mass start cross-country skiing and Australian Rosie Fordham is a fair way back.
After a hot start, at the 10.6km marker she was 33rd of 45 skiers, almost four minutes behind the leaders
Thicc bois or short kings
I know basically nothing about bobsleigh but there seem to be some “bulky” guys in it . Wouldn’t lightweights fare better?
- Phillip
Hi Phillip,
You need the beefy boys to push hard at the start, and then that extra weight will help in sliding downhill faster.
Obviously you don't want someone so big that the sled digs into the ice too much, but this is the beautiful bobsleigh balance.
Why Indra Brown is the third-best qualifier in the halfpipe final
Australian teenager Indra Brown was in fourth spot after qualifying for the freeski halfpipe final, with Great Britain's Zoe Atkin, China's Li Fanghui and Canada's Cassie Sharpe ahead of her.
But Sharpe crashed hard in her second run and, despite still showing up on the start list thanks to her brilliant first score, will not be competing.
The 2018 champion and 2022 silver medallist spent two nights in hospital and, even with the competition being delayed, is not fit to compete.
She is still suffering concussion symptoms and you can see the nasty shiner next to her right eye in that video.
"I'm OK," she stressed at the start of her video on Instagram.
"It's a tough one to swallow and not the way I wanted to end my Olympic experience but I'm dealing with a heavy concussion, a little face contusion and some lingering dizziness.
"It's just not safe for me to ski tonight, nor am I medical cleared to."
Brown will ski ninth of 11 in the final tonight.
First of final events underway
The women's 50km cross-country skiing is underway, featuring Australian Rosie Fordham.
Meanwhile, the four-man bobsleigh has started heat three at the Cortina Sliding Centre.

Why Harry and Meghan are staying quiet over Andrew’s arrest

Why Harry and Meghan are staying quiet over Andrew’s arrest
London: Amid the noise, the regret and the recriminations, one branch of the royal family has remained uncharacteristically silent.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have opted not to add their voices to the many who seemingly feel obliged to chime in on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s cataclysmic arrest and period in police custody.
Why? Because for all of Prince Harry’s simmering anger and frustration at being endlessly “lumped together” with his errant uncle, he recognises that, for once, no good can come of pitching in on his family’s shame.
The duke made his views on Andrew all too clear in his memoir, Spare.
It was, he indicated, astonishing to him that while he and Meghan were being stripped of their taxpayer-funded security for simply opting out of the institution and choosing to live abroad, Andrew, who had been accused of sexually assaulting a teenager, faced no such ramifications.
“He was embroiled in a shameful scandal, accused of the sexual assault of a young woman, and no one had so much as suggested that he lose his security,” Harry wrote.
“Whatever grievances people had against us, sex crimes weren’t on the list.”
Those two short paragraphs do a lot of heavy lifting. Those bitter rivers run deep.
Harry has long grappled with the fact that Buckingham Palace – both the family and the wider institution – “circled the wagons” on Andrew despite year upon year of tawdry revelations and accusations concerning his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.
By comparison, Harry believes he was unceremoniously cut loose before being torn to shreds for airing the family’s dirty laundry in a slew of extraordinary television interviews.
Since then, the propensity to lump Harry and Andrew under one umbrella as “the Dukes of Hazard” has only served to deepen divisions.
The Duke of Sussex had spent 10 years serving his country with distinction. His biggest crimes amounted to little more than an ill-advised fancy dress costume and a few drunken nights out. Why, then, did the family move so swiftly to cut off his funding and his security while Andrew remained protected by the institution for years?
It is hardly a secret that Harry, like his brother William, had never been much of a fan of his uncle, despite his fondness for his cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.
But he vehemently denied a report that he gave the former Duke of York “a bloody nose” during a fight at a family gathering in 2013.
According to historian Andrew Lownie’s book, Entitled, Andrew also once told his nephew that his marriage to Meghan would “not last more than a month”.
He allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever”.
Andrew is said to have told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before proposing in 2017.
In a carefully worded response to the allegations, made last year, the Sussexes’ spokesman said Andrew and Harry had “never had a physical fight, nor did Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry”.
Whatever has gone before, the Sussexes are under no illusion about the enormity of Andrew’s arrest and what it means for the monarchy’s reputation.
Harry has long railed against injustice. His personal desire for accountability was illustrated by his decision to pursue legal cases against the tabloid press.
His opinions, therefore, speak for themselves.
There is little love lost for Harry and Meghan in Britain. But whichever side of the fence one sits, it will surely come as a relief that they finally recognise there are occasions when it is better to simply say nothing at all.

Can Putin, Trump meet in Budapest? Expert assesses likelihood of new Russia-USA summit

News of the story
"On Point"
MINSK, 22 February (BelTA) - A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S President Donald Trump can still take place in Budapest if negotiators from Moscow and Washington reach certain framework agreements, participant in the Other Ukraine movement and former member of Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada Spiridon Kilinkarov said in a new episode of the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA’s YouTube channel.
“Zelensky understands perfectly well that despite all his resistance, the pressure on him to engage in negotiations will increase. Obviously, the need for an additional meeting between Putin and Trump will arise. This is because the negotiating groups can only solve certain technical tasks,” said Spiridon Kilinkarov. “Of course, this is very important and meticulous work that someone has to carry out. But ultimately, these negotiations could reach an impasse from which only the leaders of the United States or Russia can extract them. And a platform will be needed for that.”
The former MP believes that Budapest could serve as such a platform. Previously, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump had planned to meet in the Hungarian capital, but that meeting was canceled. Spiridon Kilinkarov does not rule out that the regular attacks on Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban by Vladimir Zelensky are precisely related to Kiev’s attempt to hinder such processes in Budapest.
“Relatively speaking, if they manage to reach some kind of framework agreement that would allow the two leaders to meet, then I do not rule out that at the end of March, for example, this meeting could still take place in Budapest. Trump openly declares his support for Orban, and I do not rule out that such a world-scale meeting could yield a certain result,” the former Verkhovna Rada member said.
According to him, the reason a Russia-USA summit in Budapest did not happen before was the lack of a specific topic for Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump to negotiate. However, Spiridon Kilinkarov believes that such a topic could be developed during trilateral talks between Russia, the USA, and Ukraine.

Injury toll from Russian attack on Kyiv region rises, one person killed
Ukraine's State Emergency Service said this in a post on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
Emergency workers also rescued another man while dealing with the aftermath of the Russian strike in a residential area in Sofiivska Borshchahivka.

In the early hours of Sunday, February 22, Russian forces launched a massive attack on Ukraine using drones and missiles. Kyiv city and the Kyiv region were among the targets.
In the Kyiv region, the consequences of the attack were recorded in the Boryspil, Brovary, Fastiv, Bucha, and Obukhiv districts.
Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko also said that two people injured in the attack – a woman and a child – had been taken to Kyiv hospitals from the city's suburbs.

Iran says US talks coming in March, interim nuclear deal possible
Unknown

17:42:21 KST

A senior Iranian official said indirect talks between Iran and the United States are expected in early March and that the possibility of reaching an interim agreement exists, even as significant gaps remain between the two sides over sanctions relief and uranium enrichment.
In comments to Reuters, the official said Tehran and Washington differ over the scope and mechanism of sanctions relief. Iran maintains that its right to uranium enrichment under the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be recognized.
Tehran could seriously consider a mix of exporting part of its highly enriched uranium stockpile, reducing its enrichment purity level and participating in a regional consortium, the official said.
At the same time, the official stressed that Iran would not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources to the United States. However, U.S. companies could participate as contractors in Iran’s oil and gas fields, the official said.
The remarks came as Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, said Saturday that the president is questioning why Iran has not agreed to a deal on its nuclear program.
In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff told Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, that Trump is “curious” about Iran’s position.
“He's curious as to why they haven't ... I don't want to use the word capitulated, but why they haven't capitulated,” Witkoff said.
Witkoff said Trump is asking why, “under this sort of pressure with the amount of naval power that we have over there,” Iran has not approached the United States to state it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline what it is prepared to do.
According to Witkoff, Trump’s red lines require Iran to maintain “zero enrichment” of uranium. He said Iran has enriched uranium beyond levels required for civilian purposes.
Trump has called on Iran to reach a nuclear agreement while maintaining a U.S. military presence in the Middle East in case diplomacy fails.
On Friday, Trump urged Iran to “better negotiate a fair deal.” He also cited a figure of 32,000 protesters killed in Iran, a number advanced by Iranian opposition groups that is significantly higher than other estimates.

US airlines warn over pause in two key travel programmes amid Homeland Security shutdown

US airlines warn over pause in two key travel programmes amid Homeland Security shutdown
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
A grouping of major US airlines said the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) gave travellers scant warning ahead of the temporary suspension of its PreCheck and Global Entry programmes from Feb 22, amid a shutdown of much of the agency.
The halt in the programmes run by the DHS will begin from 6am eastern time (7pm in Singapore), after the partial shutdown began last week following the failure of Republicans and Democrats to clinch a deal on immigration enforcement reforms.
“Airlines for America is deeply concerned that ... the travelling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown,” chief executive Chris Sununu said.
News of the suspensions came at “extremely short notice to travellers, giving them little time to plan accordingly,” he added in a statement, urging Congress to “get a deal done”.
A similar shutdown last autumn caused losses of US$6.1 billion (S$7.7 billion) across the travel industry and related sectors, he said.
“TSA and Customs and Border Protection are prioritising the general travelling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
“We are making tough but necessary workforce and resource decisions to mitigate the damage,” she added in a DHS statement to Reuters.
The pause in programmes is among the emergency measures DHS is taking to redirect staffing more than a week after Congress failed to send it more money, the Washington Post said.
PreCheck had more than 20 million active members, the TSA said in 2024, while total vetted airline passengers in the DHS’ traveller programmes, including Global Entry, exceeded 40 million.
The PreCheck programme allows approved passengers through a dedicated, faster security lane at US airports and is designed to reduce wait times and streamline screening.
Global Entry expedites US customs and immigration clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travellers entering the United States.
The Feb 22 move follows orders from the Trump administration last week to another constituent of the DHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to suspend deployment of aid workers to disaster-affected areas due to the shutdown. REUTERS

Palace ‘working with Government’ to remove Andrew from line of succession
- King Charles will reportedly not oppose plans to remove his brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, from the royal line of succession.
- Royal sources informed The Guardian that the King would not block legislation preventing Andrew from ever ascending to the throne.
- Calls for Andrew's removal are growing due to his association with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, which saw him arrested and questioned for 11 hours this week.
- Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly reviewing plans for an Act of Parliament to enable the removal.
- Defence minister Luke Pollard said the UK Government was working with Buckingham Palace to prevent Andrew from potentially becoming monarch.

Ukraine claims blackmail by Hungary and Slovakia over energy

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry condemned what it described as "ultimatums and blackmail" by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after they threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil.
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since January 27, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in Western Ukraine. Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage.
Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Saturday that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine within two days unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia over Ukraine's territory. Hungary's Viktor Orban made a similar threat days earlier.
The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbors that are members of the EU and NATO but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate warm ties with Moscow.
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine.
"Ukraine rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv."
Hungary, Slovakia are key for Ukraine's electricity imports
Between them, Hungary and Slovakia have been providing around half of European emergency electricity exports to Ukraine, which Kyiv increasingly relies on as Russian attacks have damaged its grid.
"If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine," Fico said in a post on X.
Kyiv said that such actions were "provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region."
Throughout the war that began with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Tuesday, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted.
Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way.
In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed shipments through Ukraine's oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine's main Black Sea port to the EU.
Since October last year, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures.

One police officer was killed, and 24 other people were injured after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called the incident a terrorist act.
Further on, it was also announced on Sunday that Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles overnight, focusing on energy infrastructure, as said by Ukrainian military and local officials.
Overnight strikes hit Kyiv, region around the capital
The overnight strikes hit Kyiv and the region around the capital, the Black Sea port Odesa and central Ukraine, they said.
At least one person was injured in the Kyiv region, with damage reported in five districts where more than a dozen houses were damaged, regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on the Telegram messaging app.
Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram that a nighttime drone attack on the energy infrastructure of the region caused fires that had been extinguished.
Russia attacks the Ukrainian energy system almost daily, striking thermal power plants and electrical substations.
Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector are important elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.

New documents show JPMorgan cut ties with Trump businesses

JPMorgan Chase told President Donald Trump and his hospitality business in February 2021 it was closing their accounts at the bank, according to new documents released Friday as part of a $5 billion lawsuit Trump has filed against the bank and CEO Jamie Dimon.
Several businesses cut ties with Trump after the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by his supporters, including two law firms that represented him and the Trump Organization, and the PGA of America, which stripped Trump's club in Bedminster, New Jersey, of the 2022 PGA Championship.
The bank did not list any specific reason for the account closures in its Feb. 19, 2021 letters to Trump and the Trump Organization. In one letter, the bank said it can sometimes "determine that a client’s interests are no longer served by maintaining a relationship with J.P. Morgan Private Bank."
A spokesperson for JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the bank's attorneys at Jones Day. The bank has previously said that Trump's suit is meritless.
A spokesperson for Trump's legal team said the disclosure of the letters are "a devastating concession that proves President Trump's entire claim."
Trump says bank intentionally de-banked family
The bank has "admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm," the Trump legal team spokesperson said.
Trump has accused JPMorgan, the largest US bank, of violating its own policies by singling him out to ride the "political tide."
The account closure letters were filed on Friday as part of a motion JPMorgan is seeking to move Trump's lawsuit from Miami federal court to New York.
"The overwhelming connections this dispute has to New York reinforce this result," the bank said in its motion.

DHS agent killed US citizen in March last year, records reveal
Texas shooting appears to be the first known instance of a US citizen being killed during Trump’s immigration crackdown.
A federal immigration agent shot dead a citizen of the United States in March 2025, months before the Trump administration began its deportation surge in Minnesota that led to the shooting deaths of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti.
According to records released this week, Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, was killed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents, lawyers for his family said in a statement.

A DHS agent fired multiple rounds at Martinez, who allegedly hit another DHS agent with his car as the agents assisted local police in South Padre Island, Texas, with traffic control following an accident on March 15, 2025, according to the records obtained by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group.
The records are part of a tranche of heavily redacted internal documents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that the nonprofit obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
The agents were conducting immigration enforcement, records show.
Martinez, who worked at an Amazon warehouse, had never had any prior run-ins with law enforcement, his mother, Rachel Reyes, said. “He was a typical young guy,” she told The Associated Press news agency. “And he wasn’t a violent person at all.”
Martinez, who was identified as a US citizen in the redacted records, was taken to hospital in nearby Brownsville, Texas, where he was later pronounced dead. The agent who was hit by a car went to the hospital for a knee injury and was later released, according to the report.
“These records paint a deeply troubling picture of the violent methods used by ICE,” Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, said in a statement.
“In just the first months of this administration, ICE’s own data shows a dramatic spike of nearly 400 per cent in use-of-force incidents – with people hospitalised, bystanders swept up in operations, and even the death of a US citizen.”
A DHS spokesperson said in a statement that Martinez “intentionally ran over” an agent with DHS’s Homeland Security Investigations, and another agent “fired defensive shots”. The nearly year-old incident is under investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Ranger Division, a DHS spokesperson said.
Call for investigation
Martinez’s shooting appears to be the first known instance of a US citizen being killed during US President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown. Federal agents in the operation shot at least five people in January alone, including Pretti and Nicole Good in Minnesota.
Martinez was trying to comply with instructions from local law enforcement when he was shot, Charles Stam and Alex Stamm, lawyers for his family, said in a statement. They called for a “full and fair investigation”.
“Ruben’s family has been pursuing transparency and accountability for nearly a year now and will continue to do so for as long as it takes,” the lawyers said.
The mounting death toll has increased scrutiny of Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown, driving a backlash among lawmakers and the public. The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement, with $170bn budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

South Korea protests Japan’s Takeshima Day event over disputed islands

South Korea on Sunday protested a Japanese government event commemorating a cluster of disputed islands between the two countries, calling the move an unjust assertion of sovereignty over its territory.
In a statement, the foreign ministry said it strongly objected to the Takeshima Day event held by Japan's Shimane prefecture and to the attendance of a senior Japanese government official, urging Japan to immediately abolish the ceremony.
The tiny islets, known as Takeshima in Japan and Dokdo in South Korea, which are controlled by them, have long been a source of tension between the two neighbors, whose relations remain strained by disputes rooted in Japan's colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945.
"Dokdo is clearly South Korea's sovereign territory historically, geographically and under international law," the ministry said, calling on Japan to drop what it described as groundless claims and to face history with humility.
The ministry summoned a top Japanese diplomat to the ministry building in Seoul to protest.
Seoul objects to Japan’s sovereignty claim over islets
A person at Japan's foreign ministry said no one was available on Sunday to comment. A call to the Prime Minister's Office went unanswered. The government sent a vice-minister from the Cabinet Office, not a cabinet minister, to the ceremony.
Seoul has repeatedly objected to Japan's territorial claims over the islands, including a protest issued on Friday over comments by Japan's foreign minister during a parliamentary address asserting Tokyo’s sovereignty over the islets.
The territory lies in fertile fishing grounds and may sit above enormous deposits of natural gas hydrate that could be worth billions of dollars, Seoul has said.

A Russian passport, a mother's vigil for Ukraine's children

A Russian passport, a mother's vigil for Ukraine's children
When her kids aren’t watching, Olga devours every piece of news she can find about the war in Ukraine. The Russian mother forces herself to look at photographs of the Ukrainians who have been killed, trying to remember the face of every child lost in her country’s four-year aggression. Speaking out has cost her friends – and left her wary of every new Russian she meets in her self-imposed exile in France.
Already in 2010, Olga* knew that she would have to leave Russia sooner rather than later. “Even back then, I didn’t feel I was living in a free country.”
Olga grew up in Moscow – a modern, privileged “bubble” where Western-style cafes buzzed with life and several flights were leaving for Europe every day – but under Vladimir Putin’s rule, she felt things were changing.
“You could feel the power of the state behind you,” she recalls. “I never expressed my opinions in public. Even sharing my thoughts with friends didn’t feel safe.”
Less than a year later, she was living in Paris, enrolled at a university as part of an exchange programme. “Officially it was for a brief period, but I already knew I was going to stay.”
She applied for French citizenship as soon as she could. Her closest friends in France were Ukrainians.
Then, in 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea.
“Before that we considered ourselves to be almost the same, that Russians and Ukrainians were one people. But after 2014 that wasn’t something you could say anymore.”
‘The Motherland’
When Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February, 2022, Olga was shocked, but she wasn’t surprised. Her stomach turned in fear for her Ukrainian friends because deep down she knew what Putin’s imperialistic regime would be capable of.
By then, Olga had also become the mother of two little boys. And somewhere in Moscow, she had a brother who risked being mobilised.
“I called my mother to help me convince him to leave Russia. I thought she would understand, as a mother.”
The response punched the air out of her lungs.
“She said: ‘If the Motherland asks your brother to fight for her, why would he refuse?’”
Since then, Olga doesn’t discuss the war with her family anymore, and conversations stay superficial, focused mainly on the children or the weather – just like they do when she speaks with others from back home.
In the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion, she noticed how her Facebook friend list dwindled after every anti-war message she posted. Some of them were childhood friends.
“People in Russia are either brainwashed or afraid –I don’t know which,” she says, and describes their unquestioning loyalty “to the Motherland” as some kind of emotional dependency. “Almost like children who defend their alcoholic father, just because he’s their father.”
Still, Olga knows that her mother is, at least partly, acting out of fear.
“She deletes all my voice messages. She thinks everything is being listened to, even if it’s just about the weather. She told me ‘it would be better for everyone’.”
Feeling watched
The war is impacting her life in France, too.
Since 2022, Olga has avoided Russian events – “I never went to them very much anyway, but now I only go if it’s a very good friend’s birthday or something” – and she stays clear from Russian institutions, like the embassy and the Russian Orthodox church in Paris.
“There are cameras that monitor you – you feel it as you approach,” she says. “And I don’t want anyone trying to recruit me.”
This is also one of the reasons she is cautious whenever she meets new Russian people in France.
“I feel very uncomfortable. You never know what they think. I avoid new Russian acquaintances as much as I can.”
She has already severed contact with at least two Russian friends in Paris. One of them started sending her pro-war propaganda, “saying Ukraine wasn’t a real country and that the Ukrainian language was fake”, and refused to stop even though Olga repeatedly told her to.
“Now, if we meet in the street, we say hello. Nothing more.”

In the first weeks following the invasion, Olga also dreaded the children’s school run. The French parents did not yet know she opposed the war. She almost wanted to carry a large sign.
“I felt like all eyes were on me, and that everyone was like: ‘What is she thinking? What side is she on?’”
The curse of a Russian passport
Over time, this feeling has hardened into something more permanent.
Olga says she no longer recognises the country printed on her passport, and plans to renounce her Russian citizenship at the first opportunity. But it involves a lot of paperwork, and would most likely require her to travel to Russia – a country she hasn’t set foot in in the past eight years.
She recently learned that her two sons are considered Russian nationals by default from birth.
“It’s horrible. I don’t want them to have any link with Russia under this regime,” she says. “They’ve never been to Russia, and I don’t know if they ever will.”
The thought weighs on her, however. "My parents are not getting younger, and as I don’t know today when and where I can meet them due to travelling challenges and the growing risk of conflict in Eastern Europe, I sometimes wonder whether I will actually see them again. This is the pain that permanently sits inside of me, and I have not yet figured a way out yet."
In the meantime, she tries to shield her children the best she can from the horrors her country is causing. But at night, when she has tucked both of them into bed, she opens up the Ukrainian-sourced YouTube and Telegram news channels she subscribes to, forcing herself to scroll through the faces of the many children killed.
“I can’t do much to help. But I think we should remember them. We owe them at least this one second.”

Police officer fired for ‘offensive’ texts about Traveller community
- Detective Constable Mark Luker of the British Transport Police has been dismissed for gross misconduct.
- The officer used derogatory terms, including “p*key”, in WhatsApp messages when referring to Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller people.
- He also made comments linking the community to theft, which the panel deemed deliberate and discriminatory.
- Luker claimed that the language was a coping mechanism after being a first responder to the 2017 London Bridge terror attack and that he did not intend to cause offence.
- Despite accepting he was not 'inherently racist', the misconduct panel concluded that Luker likely knew the language was “offensive” to a minority community.

Opinion | Why the Fed credibility crisis will hit emerging markets harder
As confidence in US monetary stewardship falters, inflation risks rise and capital flows become more volatile. Emerging markets with fewer policy buffers will bear the brunt
This reassessment – marked by quiet “sell America” trades – is beginning to surface.
The damage extends far beyond Washington. It creates long-term risks to inflation trajectories and could push the global financial system towards greater fragmentation and inefficiency, leaving emerging markets and developing economies in Asia, Latin America and Africa most exposed. To be sure, these consequences stem from multiple factors, but doubts over the Fed’s independence are undoubtedly one of the key drivers.
Yet the renewed accumulation of gold also carries macroeconomic trade-offs. Unlike reserve currencies, gold does not provide liquidity backstops or support crisis-era funding mechanisms. When more global savings flow into non-yielding assets, the international financial system becomes less flexible to shocks over time. A widespread flight to safety may undermine the efficiency of capital allocation and weaken the resilience of the global financial system.
These effects weigh heavily on emerging markets. Constrained by shallow financial markets and lower gold shares in official reserves, emerging markets have experienced a dual shift towards gold for private investors and central banks.

Sarah’s experience while hiking alone has women taking safety into their own hands

Sarah’s experience while hiking alone has women taking safety into their own hands
Sarah Gibbs wanted to show women that they were just as capable of trekking alone as men.
The psychology student, 30, had watched men’s YouTube videos on overnight hiking, and had seen much older women bush camping alone.
She decided to film her first multi-night trek to show other young women it was wrong to assume that, because of the risk, “there are lots of things men can do that we can’t”. She chose the 210-kilometre Goldfields Track from Bendigo to Ballarat.
What happened after she had walked 160 kilometres through bushfire smoke and extreme heat has caused such an outpouring of fury from women in Daylesford that some believe they must take safety into their own hands.
“I’ve been an avid day hiker all my life,” Gibbs said. “I would go to really remote areas and hike, and all these women would say to me, ‘Oh, is that safe?’ I would literally say, ‘Yeah, I’ve never felt safer.’”
But while on a single-lane track near Daylesford on January 27, Gibbs heard what sounded like “something falling down a cliff or like someone was sliding down” behind her.
Soon after, on a water stop, she saw a man jogging down the track towards her. He sat next to her, started asking questions and placed his hand on the underside of her thigh while pretending to admire her shoes.
Gibbs said he touched her hair, grabbed her hand and held it to his face, and used sexually explicit language such as, “Do you want to f--- a prince?”
When he grabbed her hand, Gibbs said, “his whole demeanour and face just went blank; it scared me to death. I felt, ‘Oh my god, this is it, this is the end.’”
He stuck to her side when she got up and was “swaying into” her so heavily on the narrow track that “it felt like he was contemplating if he could nudge me into the bush”.
Gibbs recorded what she could with her camera at her side and cajoled him as she diverted towards Lake Daylesford. When he stopped to rifle through others’ belongings at a campsite, she sprinted off. She reached the lake terrified and shaking.
‘Are police seriously interviewing people outside a pub and saying, “Good luck, take care”?’Daylesford woman Tessa Gardiner, on the police response to Sarah Gibbs
Gibbs called police intending to make a statement that she expected would lead to the man (whose image she captured) being spoken to by police. She told them he was still in the area and knew her intended route.
When an officer met her about three hours later, she said, he asked to see her footage in the busy street outside the pub but did not take a statement, a response that has outraged women in the region.
They say that, especially given high-profile attacks on women exercising alone, police should have acted.
Sexual Assault Services Victoria chief executive Kathleen Maltzahn, said that without early intervention such as Gibbs had hoped for, perpetrators are often emboldened.
“We know that getting away with less clearly criminal acts gives men permission to go on to escalate their behaviour,” she said. “The message should have been, “You have absolutely done the right thing. We are extremely concerned and will take this seriously.’”
Gibbs said the officer told her: “There’s not much we can do. Keep your wits about you and if you see him again on the track, call us back.”
Concerned that no statement had been taken, she posted on a Daylesford Facebook page hoping to learn if the man was local and whether she risked another encounter. Her post drew ABC media attention in Ballarat, and when it was shared on Daylesford pages, dozens of women reported similar experiences.
Daylesford shop owner Jo Sheppard told the ABC she had to pull a woman into her store for safety after a man matching the description allegedly assaulted her on the street. Sheppard alleged he had also harassed her daughter in the main street, and said she had made a police statement.
Victoria Police issued a media statement on February 12 stating that a thorough investigation had been conducted into Gibbs’ incident and no offence was detected. After a public outcry police have since shown some renewed interest.
Daylesford woman Tessa Gardiner said dissatisfaction with the police response had grown so high that she would establish a private local Facebook group for women to share information to protect themselves.
“[Gibbs’ story] just blew up so fast: there were so many other stories, it just felt like we could all identify with that post straight away,” Gardiner said. “There’s a sadness about the response she received from the local police. I wouldn’t even classify it as mediocre – it sounds like a failure of policing. Are they seriously interviewing people outside a pub and saying, ‘Good luck, take care’?”
Local resident Liv Brown said she had recently bought hiking gear planning to walk the Goldfields Track, but that Gibbs’ experience and its handling had discouraged her from going alone. She has offered to help Gardiner create the safety page.
Sissy Austin, also a local, was attacked and knocked unconscious with a rock by a man who was never found, while she was jogging in Lal Lal State Forest in February 2023. She invited Gibbs to speak on February 15 at a local rally for her national movement to raise awareness of assaults on women exercising outdoors, Take Back the Track.
Austin timed the annual event to mark the anniversary of incidents including the attack that left her with shocking facial injuries.
Victorian Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas spoke at the Castlemaine Take Back the Track event with Gibbs and Austin. Gibbs said she was grateful that Thomas offered her help to have a statement taken.
Thomas told this masthead that every woman, girl and gender diverse Victorian should be able to feel safe and enjoy the environment without fear. That they could not “is really distressing to me”, she said.
Mount Alexander Shire Mayor Toby Hayden, told the rally that Gibbs had been failed by local authorities.
Gibbs said on Friday that after the rally she had been invited to give a police statement, and had gone to Ballarat to do so.
A Victoria Police spokesman said contrary to its original media statement, an active and ongoing investigation was now under way.
“The details of the incident have also been recorded for the awareness of local police,” the new police statement said.

Revealed: Hundreds of school-leavers with ATARs of less than 50 offered teaching spots

Revealed: Hundreds of school-leavers with ATARs of less than 50 offered teaching spots
Almost 500 school-leavers across the nation with an ATAR of less than 50 were offered places to study teaching at university in 2025 amid fears the “concerning” trend will damage teaching standards, student learning and the economy.
Last year’s cohort was the highest number of low-achieving students offered a teaching place since 2017, when 443 students with an ATAR under 50 were offered places. While the number of teaching students is growing, so too is the proportion of students with an ATAR of less than 50, which grew to more than 2 per cent of people offered teaching places for the first time since 2017.
University admissions data released by the federal government show that 499 students who achieved between 0 and 50.00 were offered an undergraduate teaching place in 2025. There were also 666 students with ATARs in the 50s who were offered teaching places. At the other end of the spectrum, there were 450 students with an ATAR of more than 90 who were offered a place to study teaching.
“I do find it concerning that the proportion of students with an ATAR below 50 is rising. It’s an awful lot,” said UTS academic Rachel Wilson, author of a seminal 2022 report on teaching called The Profession At Risk: Trends in standards for Admission to Teaching.
A decade ago, there were 562 school-leavers with an ATAR between 0 and 50 offered teaching places. That number has been as low as 226 in 2019.
“There is a clear downward trend in the academic attainment of students [studying teaching]. Australia’s academic standards for entry to teaching are neither stable nor assured. This situation poses a serious threat … negatively impacting on the esteem of the teaching profession, Australian students’ outcomes, and national educational and economic progress,” Wilson said.
The average ATAR for a teaching student across the country was 71, compared to 78 for the average ATAR of a uni student, according to the data.
Research has repeatedly shown the aptitude of a teacher has a significant impact on student performance. In the decades since the 1980s, teacher quality and Australia’s standing in international league tables have both declined. Australian 15 year olds are 2.5 years behind their counterparts in the Baltic states.
“The risks are high if [students with low ATARs] get through their degree and get to teach in schools. We still have major challenges in meeting national benchmarks for NAPLAN and similar challenges in the international benchmark,” said Wilson.
Asked if hundreds of would-be teachers achieving an ATAR of less than 50 was acceptable, federal Education Minister Jason Clare pointed to the literacy and numeracy tests they need to pass.
“All teaching students must pass the [Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education] test. You can’t graduate without it,” he said.
Before the 2019 election, Labor said it wanted to lift the minimum ATAR to about 80. It did not take the policy to the 2022 election, but rather offered $10,000 scholarships to a select number of teaching students with an ATAR of at least 80.
“We’ve introduced scholarships for high-achieving school leaders and we have tripled the number of participants entering the High Achieving Teachers Program,” said Clare, declining to comment on the impact a low-achieving teacher might have on students.
The NSW Education Standards Authority said the state “maintains one of the strongest Initial Teacher Education frameworks in the country, to attract and prepare the best and brightest teachers for our schools”.”
NSW teaching students must achieve a minimum of three HSC Band 5 results, including one in English, as well as at least a Band 4 in HSC mathematics, although there are alternative pathways for students who do not meet those marks.
The data also shows a 23 per cent increase in teaching offers last year in NSW, which NSW Teachers Federation president Henry Rajendra attributed to the historic pay rise won by the state’s teachers in late 2023.
“We now have a good pipeline of teachers coming into the system. Over time, this means ATAR entry scores will trend higher,” he said.
The Department of Education said the pay rise and other factors, including lessened workloads, reductions in mandatory training, streamlined accreditation procedures and fewer policy changes meant more school-leavers were attracted to teaching.

How GPs plan to end Medicare politics and change bulk billing for good
Australia’s GPs want the federal government to butt out of Medicare funding, saying decisions about rebates and prices should be delegated to an independent body to avoid the politicisation of healthcare.
The call from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners would dampen future political fights over Medicare, ruling out such initiatives as the $8.5 billion boost to Medicare that became the centrepiece of Labor’s 2025 re-election campaign as well as previous government policies to freeze Medicare rebates.
Data from the office of Health Minister Mark Butler shows that the federal government’s Medicare investment is turning around GP bulk-billing rates: since November, when the Albanese government began paying doctors incentives not to charge patients out-of-pocket fees, 1300 extra clinics have become fully bulk billing.
For general adult patients targeted by the measure, bulk-billing rates have risen 7 percentage points in that time – the largest quarterly rise on record. They are up 6.4 points in NSW and 9.2 points in Victoria. The national bulk-billing rate for all patients sits at 81.4 per cent, up 4.3 points in the year since the promise was first made.
However, in its pre-budget submission, the college of GPs has said that an independent body should advise on Medicare rebates. These stipulate what the government pays doctors for certain services; doctors can then choose to charge patients a gap fee on top.
“Recent Medicare investments have shown the value the current federal government places on primary healthcare, but support from the current government doesn’t guarantee the same level of commitment from future governments,” said college national president Dr Michael Wright.
“Governments on both sides of politics have set rebates based on short-term political imperatives, rather than from a sound evidence base.”
The Albanese government is offering GP clinics additional lump-sum payments if they bulk bill all of their patients, in a bid for them to change their funding models.
But Wright said the key issue for GPs as they considered changing their business practices was the risk that the policy would not endure under future governments.
“For many practices, moving to become a fully bulk-billing practice is not just a financial decision – it is about trust,” he said.
“An independent authority enshrined in legislation would provide the certainty many GPs need when making financial decisions about the future of their practices. It would provide transparent, evidence‑based decision-making that directs funding where it’s most effective and most needed.”
Several of the college’s budget ideas in previous years – tripling bulk-billing incentives, and extending them to adult patients – have eventually become government policy as Labor has looked to restore the accessibility of primary care.
Health economist Stephen Duckett, a former secretary of the federal Health Department, said he had previously recommended the idea, as had recent reviews commissioned by the government.
“If you look at any GP comments, they say you can’t trust governments – by which they mean Liberal governments, but they don’t make that explicit – because they went ahead and froze the rebate,” Duckett said.
“My own view is that you can’t expect practices to change everything they do when it is at the whim of the government what the rebates are. If we want Medicare to be well accepted by the medical profession, as well as consumers, then fair fee-setting would have to be part of that.”
Both hospitals and aged-care facilities have independent pricing bodies. The college of GPs has highlighted recent data from the Report on Government Services that shows spending on hospitals rose 30 per cent over a decade, while spending on general practice had risen 13 per cent.
It also pointed out that the Medicare rebate for a standard consultation had risen 22 per cent since 2010, while health inflation had risen 62 per cent. A significant reason for the discrepancy was a freeze on Medicare rebates, introduced in the dying days of the Labor government in 2013 and maintained by the Coalition until 2018.
Wright said Medicare rebates had “failed to keep pace with inflation and rising operational costs, driving up out-of-pocket expenses and creating barriers to access”.
Duckett said the biggest barrier to introducing an independent pricing authority would be the Treasury, which would not want to lose any levers to control spending. Health spending is one of the most expensive budget items.
He suggested another way to bake in certainty would be legislating that Medicare rebates must rise with inflation – this would be more difficult, politically, for governments to change.
Butler, meanwhile, said his Medicare changes “are helping ease cost‑of‑living pressures, strengthen primary care, and ensure Australians can access reliable, high‑quality health services close to home”.
There are now 126 urgent care clinics across the country, with four more due to open this week. Australians have saved $2.2 billion on pharmaceuticals too, as the government has lowered the maximum co-payment for scripts to $25.

Qantas, union at loggerheads over job security in AI-era

Qantas, union at loggerheads over job security in AI-era
Qantas and a key union are at odds over job security amid a round of job cuts linked to the adoption of new technology at the airline’s Sydney headquarters.
The Australian Services Union said workers were told they would be replaced by AI, though the union did not provide details of that claim, which the airline denies.
On Monday, Qantas and the union are scheduled to meet for consultation following the termination of 30 roles at company headquarters last week.
While the 30 roles have been eliminated as Qantas simplifies its management structure, the consultation will determine whether staff who held those positions can be relocated to other roles, and what redundancy payments are on offer. The jobs were at Qantas’ headquarters in Mascot, NSW.
The ASU also wants to know whether the reductions are the first round of a multi-tranche redundancy plan. Under the terms of the EBA signed in January, Qantas has an obligation to consult on jobs, the union said.
“Unless Qantas is prepared to immediately back away from this announcement and commence genuine consultation with the union and our members, we see no alternative other than to lodge a dispute with the Fair Work Commission,” the union’s NSW ACT secretary, Angus McFarland, said.
The affected jobs include freight, crew support, finance and airport services, among other roles.
“Our members need to know that their jobs are safe and secure,” McFarland said. “If their jobs are redundant, they need to know that their entitlements will be paid, or they will be offered training to apply for new jobs.
“Just six months ago, when we bargained for a new agreement, Qantas refused to provide any protections for our members against job losses due to AI – now we know why.”
Qantas denied the job losses were related to AI, but it did not dispute that other technology played a role. It said the company continues to grow in other areas. It also said no further jobs should be cut as part of the restructure announced in December 2025.
“We advised the Australian Services Union on Wednesday last week of the changes and are meeting with them on Monday to discuss ways to reduce the impact on affected employees,” a company spokesperson said.
“This includes considering redeployment opportunities into one of the newly created roles resulting from these changes, or into other roles across the group.”
The union also questioned whether the redeployment of laid-off staff was “genuine” – with appropriate work, pay, responsibility and shifts.
McFarland said: “Our members turned up for work on Wednesday, were taken aside and told effectively that their job had been replaced by AI and they have four weeks to find another job.”
When asked for more detail, the union would not say what AI tools it claimed Qantas was using to replace the staff.
The job cuts followed Qantas’ December 3 announcement that it would trim the size of its group leadership team while elevating the role of a technology-focused executive.
In December, QantasLink chief Rachel Yangoyan was named chief technology, AI and transformation officer to oversee “AI strategy, data and analytics and enterprise technology-driven transformation programs”.
At the time, chief executive Vanessa Hudson said the company was recruiting a group chief AI officer “to lead implementation and scaling of AI across the organisation” and that recruitment was under way.
Qantas is establishing a product innovation centre in Adelaide to sharpen its delivery of “world-leading digital experiences” for the millions of customers who travel with the airline each year.
Hudson has worked to improve morale and industrial relations within the company since taking over from Alan Joyce in 2023, amid bitter recriminations between staff and management. The company was later found to have unlawfully sacked nearly 1800 ground crew in 2020.
Hudson ordered a $1000 one-off “thank you” to 23,000 non-executive staff, praising employees’ “fantastic” efforts in 2024. Last year, she followed up by outlining a non-executive employee share plan that provides staff with $1000 worth of shares every year, linked to Qantas’ financial performance.
Despite efforts to rebuild trust between management and staff, the aviation sector as a whole is not immune to the impact of technology reshaping workflows and employment.
Innovations in ticketing, marketing and operations are flowing through the aviation industry, even as the air carriers seek to manage costs by refreshing their fleets with newer, more efficient planes, which can dramatically affect costs.
Anxiety about the impact of artificial intelligence has become a recurring theme across industries as varied as education, financial services and programming.
Qantas is scheduled to release its half-year financial results on February 26.
The airline is coming off a strong performance last year, where underlying earnings climbed 15 per cent to $2.39 billion – a boost driven by a surge in vacation travel, significant expansion from Jetstar, and a positive future forecast.

‘It’s really unfair’: Leo’s Supermarket Heidelberg to close in weeks
Leo’s Supermarket in Heidelberg will close earlier than planned, with shoppers reporting flagging customer numbers and dwindling stock.
But the new owner of the site, in Burgundy Street, revealed that a new supermarket and five shops will replace it.
Customers on Sunday said they were sad that after 25 years of trading, Leo’s Fine Food and Wine supermarket in Heidelberg, which is known for its gourmet produce, will shut for good on March 13.
Mario Lo Giudice, managing director of the new owner of the site, Banco Group, confirmed the closure date was correct but emphasised refurbishment plans, which will include a new supermarket, were under way.
A planning permit had been obtained to refurbish the building, retaining a supermarket and creating five new shops along Burgundy Street.
“We are negotiating with a number of independent supermarket operators,” he told this masthead.
In June last year, when this masthead reported the Burgundy Street store had been sold, its management indicated that the Heidelberg supermarket and its sister store in Kew would close at the end of 2026.
On hearing news of the March 13 closure, customer of 16 years Sandra Andary, of Rosanna, said: “I’m devastated, like everybody else. It’s really unfair. The strip, the community needs this.
“It’s like a hub. A guy just said ‘hi’ to me, he met me during COVID and remembered my name. There’s a beautiful community that come together around Leo’s.”
She said Leo’s sold items that you can’t get elsewhere and she had favourite brands like Green Nation Life multipurpose cleaner, and Earth Taste Life Himalayan Pink Salt.
“I buy the frozen berries, I buy good quality meat from here and nice brands of bread and milk.”
Andary said since the closure was announced last year she had noticed customer numbers were down and she herself had shopped there less, feeling it was harder to stay attached to the place, knowing it was closing.
Lifelong Heidelberg resident and Leo’s fan since it opened in 2001 Gerald Sheahan said he was disappointed about the closure and having to shop at Coles now.
Another regular Steve Caddy, from Heidelberg, said, “I’m very sad about it closing.”
Caddy said while he gets staple groceries at Woolworths he gets “all the good stuff” at Leo’s such as Sergio Valentino durum wheat semolina pasta, Irrewarra sourdough bread, and Ivan’s chunky Angus beef pies.
“The herbs like dill, thyme and tarragon are always fresher here, and they’re in bigger batches, than in other places.”
In addition, he said Leo’s had been a community hub. “There are always interesting people shopping here, there’s a more interesting vibe because there are unique foods, and everything’s a bit fresher.”
He said there were always old Italian songs playing on the sound system.
“It’s something that makes Heidelberg unique,” Caddy said.
It’s not known whether Kew Leo’s will close at the end of 2026 as originally planned.
In June last year, developer Orchard Piper announced that the Leo’s block in Princess Street, Kew, which it had bought, would be turned into luxury housing in a joint venture backed by billionaire James Packer.
The new Kew building will also include shops and a fine-produce offering.

Iran rocked by fresh protests, as Trump threatens strikes over nuclear deal

Iran rocked by fresh protests, as Trump threatens strikes over nuclear deal
Iranian university students have resumed protesting against the regime on the first day of a new semester, as US President Donald Trump considers limited military strikes to pressure the Islamic republic into signing a new nuclear deal.
The Pentagon has orchestrated a massive deployment to the region that includes two aircraft carriers, fighter jets and refuelling planes, giving Trump the option to launch limited, or extended, operations against Iran.
Trump has also reportedly been briefed on options to assassinate the son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and various mullahs.
The campus demonstrations came a month after a deadly government crackdown that killed thousands of people. While the government has not acknowledged the latest protests, state-affiliated news media reported on the tension on university campuses.
A video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran’s Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a “murderous leader”, and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah, to be a new monarch.
State-affiliated news agencies such as SNN carried videos of clashes, with protesters allegedly injuring volunteer student Basij militia by throwing rocks at Iran’s top engineering university. Pro-government Basij members often assist security forces in quelling protests.
Protests were also held in Beheshti and Amir Kabir universities in the capital Tehran and Mashhad University in the northeast, according to unverified videos published by rights group HAALVSH.
In the western town of Abdanan, a hotspot for protests, demonstrators chanted “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the dictator” after the arrest of an activist teacher, according to rights group Hengaw and social media posts.
The protests coincided with ceremonies traditionally held after 40 days to mourn those killed by security forces during last month’s anti-government demonstrations, which saw thousands lose their lives in the worst domestic unrest since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Activism by students and Tehran shopkeepers grew into a nationwide protest movement that appeared to threaten the regime before it was violently suppressed.
The Iran government acknowledges more than 3000 people were killed in January, but rights groups such as the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency say at least 7000 were killed, with more to come as numbers are verified.
Iran experts argue that bombing the country in the middle of negotiations might derail a deal, and could prompt a deadly cycle of retaliation.
Tehran would likely suspend participation in talks if the US launched a strike, according to a senior government official in the region, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.
“He’s not going to get a diplomatic agreement out of the Iranians if he attacks them again,” said Barbara Slavin, a fellow at the Stimson Centre in Washington. The military threats alone — even if the US doesn’t ultimately act on them – “is going to make them less willing to make a deal.”
While Trump has given a deadline of between 10 and 15 days, it also remains unclear what a new round of airstrikes – limited or otherwise – would actually achieve.
Israel and the US bombed the country’s nuclear sites and air defences extensively last June, with the president saying at the time that “key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated”.
The US and Israel could target Iran’s ballistic missiles, but the danger there is Tehran could be spurred to fire them off at US or allied targets before it loses them, according to Slavin.
Asked during a Friday news conference about what his message would be to the Iranian people, Trump said: “They better negotiate a fair deal. They better negotiate.”
Speaking on Fox News Saturday, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said “zero enrichment” is non-negotiable for any deal with Iran. “And we have to have the material back.”
“They’re probably a week away from having industrial-grade bomb-making material and that’s really dangerous, so you can’t have that,” he said. “This is something they have to stick with until they prove to us that they can behave.”
He added that Trump is “curious” why Iran hasn’t capitulated to the demands in the face of US military power.
The shifting US rationale for talks – and strikes – makes deciphering US intent even more difficult. Trump’s initial threat of airstrikes was in support of the protests in Iran in December and January rather than a nuclear deal.

Russia carried out a large-scale combined drone and missile attack across Ukraine overnight on Feb. 22, killing one person and injuring at least 15 others in the Kyiv region as explosions were reported in multiple cities.
The Ukrainian Air Force said the night initially began relatively calmly before waves of drones entered Ukrainian airspace around 2 am (00:00 UTC), according to RBC-Ukraine. The first were detected over the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad and Donetsk regions, with their numbers increasing over time.

By approximately 4 am (02:00 UTC), air raid alerts were issued in Kyiv and across roughly half the country as ballistic missiles were launched. Targets were reported approaching from the north and later from the south.
Monitoring channels indicated that Zircon missiles may have been launched from occupied Crimea, though this was not officially confirmed.
At around 4:30 a.m. (02:30 UTC), Russian forces scrambled Mikoyan MiG-31K aircraft, which are capable of carrying Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missiles. No confirmed launches were reported. Strategic bombers – Tu-95MS and Tu-160 – were also airborne overnight. Monitoring channels suggested launch maneuvers may have taken place around 4:30 a.m., potentially placing cruise missiles over Ukrainian airspace around 6 am.
Kyiv targeted multiple times
Kyiv was among the first cities to come under attack. Between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. (02:00-02:30 UTC), explosions were heard in the capital during ballistic missile launches. Enemy drones were also detected in the Kyiv region.
UK Should Send Non-Combat Troops to Ukraine ‘Now’ – Boris Johnson
By 5:12 am (03:12 UTC), explosions were reported in Kyiv for the third time overnight, with Russian forces again attempting a ballistic strike.
One hour later, another series of explosions was heard amid what was described as a cruise missile attack on the capital. The Air Force reported targets flying directly toward Kyiv, while monitoring channels warned that drones were entering simultaneously.
Initial reports indicated that a multi-story residential building in the Sviatoshynskyi district had been damaged, with a fire on the roof.
“At 05:33 [03:33 UTC], as a result of the attack, a residential multi-story building in the Sviatoshynskyi district was damaged. There is a fire on the roof of the building. We are clarifying information about the injured,” Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, wrote on Telegram.
However, around an hour later, Tkachenko posted an update stating: “The information was not confirmed.”
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko later reported that a woman and a child from the capital’s suburbs were hospitalized after being injured. Preliminary information suggested debris had fallen in a private residential area.
Casualties reported in Kyiv region
The head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, Mykola Kalashnyk, later reported that one person was killed and 15 others injured as a result of the attack in the Kyiv region.
“Currently, we have confirmed information about 15 injured people, including four children. Unfortunately, one person died from the injuries sustained,” Kalashnyk said in a Telegram update.
He said the largest number of casualties was recorded in the Fastiv district, where rescuers pulled eight people from beneath the rubble of a destroyed building. Seven sustained injuries of varying severity.
“Despite all efforts by doctors, one man died from his injuries,” Kalashnyk said.
Five people were transported to medical facilities, including the deceased man. Four injured individuals remain under treatment. Three are in serious condition, including two undergoing surgery.
Additional injuries were reported in the Boryspil, Vyshhorod, Obukhiv and Bucha districts. Victims suffered shrapnel wounds, lacerations, fractures, smoke inhalation and acute stress reactions.
Rescue services, medics and police continue working at the sites of impact.
Kropyvnytskyi and other regions hit
In Kropyvnytskyi, local media reported at least two explosions around 4 am (02:00 UTC). Shortly before the first blast, the military had reported a high-speed target heading toward the city before changing course toward Kyiv.
At 5:33 am (03:33 UTC), further explosions were heard. Monitoring channels suggested a possible ballistic strike, though no official confirmation was provided.
Explosions were also reported in Mykolaiv at approximately 5:22 am (03:22 UTC), with the cause unclear.
In Poltava, explosions were heard as cruise missiles were reported flying over the region.
Poland scrambles tactical and strategic aircraft
Poland scrambled fighters and strategic aircraft overnight due to Russia’s overnight attack on Ukraine, according to the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces in a post on X.
“Due to the activity of long-range aviation of the Russian Federation, which is carrying out strikes on the territory of Ukraine, Polish and allied aircraft have begun operations in our airspace,” the command said.
On-duty fighter pairs and an airborne early warning aircraft were scrambled, while ground-based air defense systems and radar reconnaissance units were placed on heightened alert.
The command described the measures as preventive and aimed at ensuring security in areas adjacent to the Ukrainian border. It added that forces remain ready for immediate response as the situation continues to be monitored.
Pattern of combined strikes
The Feb. 22 attack followed another combined Russian strike on Feb. 17, when drones, ballistic and cruise missiles were also used.
At that time, the primary targets included the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions and the city of Burshtyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region.
In Dnipro, enterprises, administrative buildings, residential houses and vehicles were damaged. In Odesa, an infrastructure facility, civilian buildings, a store and a service station were hit, and a high-rise building caught fire. In Burshtyn, Russian forces attempted to strike a thermal power plant.
The full extent of damage and casualties from Saturday night’s strike was still being clarified as of the morning.

Lionel Messi, Inter Miami routed by LAFC in MLS season opener
The Inter Miami player began his club’s MLS Cup title defence with a crushing away loss to rivals Los Angeles FC.
David Martinez scored in the first half, Denis Bouanga scored and added an assist in the second and Los Angeles FC completed a 3-0 victory over Lionel Messi and visiting Inter Miami in the teams’ season opener on Saturday night.
Substitute Nathan Ordaz added the final goal for the hosts, who moved the match to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and drew a crowd of 75,673, the second-largest in Major League Soccer (MLS) history for a regular-season game that was not part of a double-header.

Son Heung-Min provided the final assist on Martinez’s opener for the Los Angeles-based football club, who have lost only twice in 16 games since signing the South Korean star last summer.
Hugo Lloris made three saves for the hosts, who held Messi’s Herons scoreless in a match he played for the first time in 15 matches in all competitions, a stretch that dates back to a 3-0 regular-season loss at Charlotte on September 13.
Mexican-Argentinian striker German Berterame made his debut for Miami, which held 63 percent of the possession.
But LAFC threatened constantly in transition, especially during the first half, and finished the night leading 16-13 in shots and 6-3 in efforts on target.
Martinez put LAFC in front in the 38th minute on one such moment.
Timothy Tillman began the attack when his dogged defensive work turned over Messi’s national team teammate Rodrigo de Paul in midfield.
The ball fell to Stephen Eustaquio, who played a first-touch pass to Son above the box. Son played it on into the run of Martinez down the left, and Martinez finished crisply past Dayne St Clair for his eighth career MLS goal.
St Clair created trouble for himself on Bouanga’s tally in the 73rd minute, racing outside the box in an attempt to reach Tillman’s diagonal ball.
But Bouanga was first by a healthy margin and headed the ball beyond the goalkeeper before finishing into a stranded goal.
Bouanga then set up Ordaz to seal it in the fourth minute of second-half stoppage time, beating his defender down the left flank before driving in a low cross.

Should I worry about how much water my AI chatbot conversations are using?
As AI advances at rapid rates, concerns are growing over the vast amount of water it is using. Harriette Boucher takes a look at how people’s AI usage is consuming water, and whether or not it is a problem
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Artificial Intelligence (AI)’s thirst for water has sparked widespread environmental fears, with many concerned that the rapidly advancing technology is putting further strain on the world’s resources.
Each prompt or question a person feeds AI will require energy and water to cool the data centre containing the software. The estimates of how much water AI is using have been widely debated, and different AI companies report varying numbers.
Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, has said ChatGPT uses less than 1/15 teaspoon for an average query. A Google Gemini study claims an average AI prompt uses less than 0.3ml of water.
But other estimates suggest it uses far more. Research from the University of California in 2023 calculated that ChatGPT “drinks” roughly 500ml of water for every 10 to 50 medium-length responses.
A report by the UK Government Digital Sustainability Alliance predicts that AI could drive global water usage up from 1.1 billion to 6.6 billion cubic metres by 2027, an amount equivalent to more than half of the UK’s total water usage.
Why does AI use water?
Data centres, which power software like ChatGPT or Google Gemini, rely on water to cool the systems and prevent them from overheating.
They also use water for electricity generation, and during the manufacturing of the hardware they run on.
The Lincoln Institute of Conventional Policy said a mid-sized data centre will consume as much water as a small town, and a larger one, which requires up to 5 million gallons of water every day, will use as much as a city of 50,000 people.
Why are people concerned about it?
People are concerned about AI’s water consumption as they fear it is putting growing demand on already limited supplies.
By using local water supplies, data centres are putting pressure on surrounding communities, which people fear will only worsen as AI expands, especially in areas where water is already scarce.
Members of the Government Digital Sustainability Alliance Planetary Impact working group said that almost 68 per cent of data centres were near protected or key biodiversity areas, where the ecosystems rely on clean water supplies, and whose communities depended on them.
As the demand for water increases, water scarcity and water stress are becoming more prevalent issues.
The group said: “Demand for fresh water is expected to exceed supply by 40 per cent by the end of the decade and 55 cent of global data centres are in river basins with high risk of water pollution, meaning much of the local water may be unsafe for use, increasing the pressure on clean water supplies and worsening the overall water scarcity in the regions.”
Is it a problem?
Many experts say the amount of water AI is consuming is a global crisis. However, others say that fears have been overstated.
Andy Masley, the director of Effective Altruism DC, a not-for-profit focused on improving the community through research, claims that the amount of water used by an individual is far smaller than most assume.
He said that hundreds of thousands of ChatGPT “prompts” would require less water than your pair of jeans, which the UN says takes around 7,500 litres of water to produce.
“That's incredibly small by the standards of how most people use water in their day-to-day lives,” he told The Independent. “Almost all of our water footprint is actually invisible to us because it happens off-site and in other places.”
Mr Masley estimates a person would need to submit more than 1,000 prompts in a day to increase their daily water footprint by just one per cent.
Staying home and generating that many prompts could actually result in a smaller water footprint than going out and using electricity, he said.
A water footprint measures the total amount of freshwater used to produce a product. The European Union now requires data centres to report their annual freshwater consumption.
Sam Gilbert, a researcher at the University of Cambridge’s Bennett School of Public Policy, said the issue is not individual consumption but the impact that centres have on their immediate environment, and the demand they place on local water supplies.
He said there needs to be more transparency from companies that build and use these data centres around what the real environmental footprint of them is going to be.
Mr Gilbert said that the estimate that ChatGPT uses 500ml of water for every 10 to 50 responses is “probably overstated”.
“But even if it was correct, that's just not very much water in the context of the amount of water that people use in their everyday lives,” he said.
However, Nick Couldry, a sociologist from the London School of Economics, said: "Whatever the rival calculations on water use, we have to consider the sustainability of the massively increased data processing that an economy and society largely dependent on AI will require.”
He said even if water usage can be reduced, technology companies “want and need us to use AI constantly for even more of our lives”.
“It is hard to see how this addictive business model won't lead to unsustainable demands on the physical environment and rival versions of AI development will demand even more energy,” he added.
Shaolei Ren, an engineering professor at the University of California, said one of the main issues is that many data centres have a high peak water usage over the summer, which is putting immense pressure on the public water system.
Thames Water has previously warned data centres that could face restrictions on use during the hottest and driest times of the year.
Mr Ren said: “Water is a local and seasonal resource. There’s plenty of water in total, but just not everywhere or every time we need it. Only looking at the total volume without considering locational or timing contexts can miss the important nuances.
“The water infrastructure must be sized to support the peak demand. But expanding the water infrastructure capacity is extremely costly for public water systems.”
Can AI help save water from other processes?
Mr Ren said that AI can also help save water from other processes. Some of the ways in which it is already doing this is through technology that is able to detect leaks and improve energy-efficient water distribution.
In 2024, a water company in Surrey began using AI to reduce leaks across its network. The World Economic Forum reported that once AI-enabled water solutions in the United States are fully implemented, they will be able to reduce water use by 15 per cent.
Google’s data centre in Waltham Cross uses air-cooling to limit the amount of water it uses. A spokesperson told The Independent: "As a pioneer in computing infrastructure, Google’s data centres are some of the most efficient in the world.
“Beyond our operations, Google is committed to improving local watershed health where it operates office campuses and data centres and replenishing 120 per cent of the water it consumes, on average.”

Modi’s Israel visit: Timeline of India’s relations with Israel, Palestine
From Mahatma Gandhi’s support for Palestine to Modi’s Netanyahu embrace, we trace how India’s ties have evolved over the decades.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to begin his two-day visit to Israel on February 25, nine years after his first trip to the country.
His 2017 trip was the first ever by an Indian prime minister to Israel.

His upcoming visit also comes just days after India, together with more than 100 other nations, condemned Israel’s de facto expansion in the occupied West Bank after New Delhi initially appeared to hesitate about adding its name to the criticism.
From defence and security to trade and technology, India and Israel have forged tight ties in recent years, even as New Delhi has turned cool towards the plight of Palestinians, despite decades of support for their struggle for a sovereign nation.
While multiple Western leaders have visited Netanyahu in Israel since the October 7, 2023 attack, very few Global South leaders have, making Modi’s visit more significant, say analysts.
Addressing the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations in Jerusalem on February 15, Netanyahu said the two prime ministers were going to discuss “all sorts of cooperation”.
“Tremendous alliance between Israel and India, and we are going to discuss all sorts of cooperation. Now, you know, India is not a small country. It has 1.4 billion people. India is enormously powerful, enormously popular,” he said.
But India’s ties with Israel were not always this cosy. Here is a timeline of how their relations have evolved — from hostility and suspicion, to secret weapons trade and now open embrace — and what that means for India’s relations with Palestine.
1930s and 40s: India opposes the creation of Israel
Under British colonialism, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Between 1920 and 1948, Palestine was under British administration, and the United Kingdom, through the Balfour Declaration of 1917, had promised Jews, who had been displaced from Europe due to Adolf Hitler’s oppression, a homeland in the British Mandate in Palestine.
This was opposed by many nations, including India, which were also fighting British colonialism at the time.
“Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English, or France to the French,” Mahatma Gandhi, India’s most prominent freedom fighter, revered as the Father of the Nation, wrote in an article in his weekly newspaper Harijan, on November 26, 1938.
While he also sympathised with the Jews in his article and said “the German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel in history”, Gandhi stressed that it would be “wrong and inhumane to impose the Jews on the Arabs”.
“It would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home,” he wrote.
In 1947, India became an independent nation, and that same year, it voted against the United Nations Partition Plan of Palestine into the Jewish state of Israel and the state of Palestine, comprising Palestinian Arabs. According to the book, Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru, Volume 5, the first Indian prime minister’s sister, Vijaylaxmi Pandit, who was India’s envoy to the UN, received death threats to pressure New Delhi to vote in favour of the division. But the Nehru government did not buckle.
Instead, India, erstwhile Yugoslavia and Iran advocated for a single federated state with — per Nehru — “the largest possible autonomy to respected regions where the Jews and Arabs are in majority”.
“We have maintained that Palestine should be independent and free from the control of any single power; that no solution can be lasting unless it is based on the consent of both Arabs and Jews; and no lasting solution is possible which is imposed and maintained by force,” Nehru said in 1948.
In 1949, India also voted against Israel’s UN membership.
1950s: India recognises Israel, but refuses to set up diplomatic ties
But Israel was keen for recognition and sent many envoys to meet Indian officials.
Renowned scientist Albert Einstein was among those nudged by Israel to help convince India to recognise the Jewish nation.
In a letter to Nehru in June 1947, Einstein told him to end “the rivalries of power politics and the egotism of petty nationalist appetites” and support “the glorious renaissance which has begun in Palestine”.
At the time, Nehru was not convinced, but eventually, on September 17, 1950, India recognised Israel. “We would have [recognised] long ago, because Israel is a fact. We refrained because of our desire not to offend the sentiments of our friends in the Arab countries,” Nehru said, post recognition.
However, India steered clear of establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. For four decades to follow, India even forbade the use of its passport for travel to Israel.
1960s: Pro-Palestinian, with an opening for Israel
India’s political and diplomatic sympathies continued to lie firmly behind the Palestinian cause. In May 1960, Nehru visited UN troops stationed in Gaza.
But when war broke out between India and China in 1962, then Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion wrote to Nehru, offering his sympathies and weapons.
India accepted Israeli weapons and munitions, but requested that the ships supplying them not bear Israeli flags, so as not to antagonise New Delhi’s Arab allies. These details have been revealed in documents held in archives in Jerusalem, and India has not disputed them. This marked the beginning of a decades-long covert relationship between India and Israel.
Israel again supplied India with munitions during its 1965 war against Pakistan.
1970s: Secret Israeli weapons and a historic Palestinian recognition
As tensions between India and Pakistan spiked in 1971, DN Chatterjee, India’s ambassador to France, wrote to the Ministry of External Affairs, advocating for New Delhi to seek Israeli assistance.
The then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, accepted the proposal, scholar Srinath Raghavan wrote in his book, 1971. Through India’s external intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), the country began the process of procuring Israeli arms via Liechtenstein.
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir wrote to Indira, seeking diplomatic recognition for Israel in return, but India demurred.
Instead, despite the military help it had sought and received from Israel, India grew even closer to the Palestinian movement diplomatically through the 1970s. In 1974, it became the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) as the sole representative of the Palestinian people. The following year, the PLO opened an office in India. Thousands of Palestinian students came to India for their higher studies.
1980s: ‘My sister’ and a planned attack on a nuclear facility
By the 1980s, India’s relations with Palestine and Israel had fallen into a familiar pattern. New Delhi overtly, loudly declared its support for the Palestinian cause, and PLO leader Yasser Arafat made frequent visits to the country. But covertly, Israel and India had established security ties.
In 1983, when Arafat visited India for a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, he described Indira, the prime minister, as his “sister”, underscoring the personal and nation-to-nation affinity that existed at the time between India and Palestine.
But the early 1980s also saw Israel propose to India a joint operation to attack a Pakistani nuclear facility, which New Delhi turned down.
In 1988, India became among the world’s first non-Arab nations to recognise Palestinian statehood.
1990s: India and Israel establish diplomatic ties
With the Cold War over and a unipolar world emerging, India adjusted several of its diplomatic positions. Domestically, India opened up its economy starting in 1991. Externally, it reached out to the United States and, in January 1992, turned its long-hidden relationship with Israel into the establishment of formal diplomatic ties.
In a September 2022 report for the Indian think tank Observer Research Foundation, retired Indian diplomat Navdeep Suri wrote that New Delhi took decades to establish diplomatic ties with Israel because of India’s “support for anti-colonial movements and its close ties with Arab countries”.
In fact, India’s prime minister in 1992, PV Narasimha Rao, announced the decision to set up diplomatic ties with Israel just weeks after Arafat had visited New Delhi and said he would respect India’s decision on the matter.
India and Israel set up their embassies in Tel Aviv and New Delhi, respectively.
In 1999, Israel helped India during the Kargil war when its troops were trying to force out Pakistan’s military and Kashmiri rebels who had occupied strategic positions on the Indian side of the de facto border between them, known as the Line of Control or LoC. Israel aided India militarily by supplying laser-guided bomb kits and missiles.
2014 onwards: An open embrace
In the early 2000s, India became one of Israel’s largest buyers of defence equipment.
But in 2014, when Modi came to power, India’s ties with Israel witnessed a sharp upturn; the hesitancy of the past was shed once and for all.
Under the Modi government in 2015, India’s president at the time, Pranab Mukherjee, became the first Indian president to visit Israel, seeking to strengthen bilateral economic and defence ties.
In July 2017, Modi visited Israel, becoming the first Indian prime minister to visit the country. During that visit, according to Indian media reports, Modi and Netanyahu said they “visualised that the two countries will become close partners in development, technology, innovation, entrepreneurship, defence and security”. A year later, in January 2018, Netanyahu also visited New Delhi.
In 2021, under Modi, the Indian Air Force participated in a multilateral air force exercise called Blue Flag-2021 in Israel. Israeli defence companies like Elbit Systems and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems have also established partnerships with Indian firms, such as Adani Group and Tata Advanced Systems.
Trade relations between the two nations have also strengthened under the Modi government. India is currently Israel’s second-largest trading partner in Asia, after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.
India’s main exports to Israel include pearls, precious stones, automotive diesel, chemicals, machinery, and electrical equipment, among others, while imports include petroleum, chemical machinery and transport equipment, etc. The two countries also signed a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) last September.
At a time when many Western countries, including allies of Israel, have sanctioned far-right members of Netanyahu’s cabinet, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, these ministers have been welcomed in India.
Israeli companies have also sought to hire more employees from India in recent years. After Israel suspended work permits for thousands of Palestinians following the October 2023 attack by Hamas and other Palestinian groups, Israel hired thousands of Indians to work in their place.
Meanwhile, India has been a tourist destination for Israelis, with many of them holidaying in the country after serving their mandatory time in the Israeli army.
Kfir Tshuva, a lecturer in economics at the Ramat Gan Academic College in Israel, said, under Modi, India and Israel’s relationship has become more visible and politically open.
However, he noted that India’s approach in the Middle East was also one of strategic balancing — in which New Delhi maintains separate and independent relationships with multiple actors that may have conflicting interests, rather than framing its policy as a zero-sum choice.
“This allows India to deepen cooperation with Israel in areas such as defence, technology and economic integration, while also sustaining diplomatic engagement with the Palestinian leadership and strong ties with Arab states,” he said.
“Modi’s visit to Israel [next week] should therefore be understood within this broader strategic calculus. It reflects New Delhi’s effort to integrate stronger bilateral cooperation with Israel into its wider regional strategy without undermining its commitment to peace, its support for a two-state solution, or its substantive relationships with Arab partners,” he added.
Kadira Pethiyagoda, author and geopolitical strategist, told Al Jazeera that there are currently multiple countervailing forces at play.
“On one hand, India’s short-term interests are advanced by defence trade and investment, and remittances from Israel; on the other, India’s long-term goal of becoming a ‘great power’ with a strategic footprint in the Middle East, invariably involves reducing US regional hegemony,” he said.
“This requires that Israel is balanced by other regional powers, like Iran, which have closer ties to India than the US. India would not want to contribute to Israel achieving complete dominance in the Middle East,” he noted.
What does this mean for India’s relations with Palestine?
Under Modi, India has officially maintained its support for a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel — backing the two-state solution — even as he has embraced more publicly warm ties with Netanyahu.
But India has been cautious in criticising Israel’s actions on Gaza, even before the genocidal war that began in 2023.
In 2016, India abstained from a UN vote which sought to bring Israel before the International Criminal Court (ICC) for its alleged war crimes during its conflict with Gaza in 2014. When Israel began its genocidal war on Gaza, India condemned the humanitarian crisis in the enclave but repeatedly abstained from UN resolutions which called for a ceasefire. In 2024, India also abstained from a UN Human Rights Council resolution which called for an arms embargo on Israel.
India has, however, been critical of Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank. Last week, India joined more than 100 nations in condemning Israel’s recent plans to occupy more territory in the region.
A joint statement issued by the nations rejected “all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem”.
“Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardize the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict,” the statement added.
But India joined that statement only a day after the first batch of 80 countries and organisations signed it, drawing criticism from the domestic opposition.
Modi’s visit to Israel, too, has drawn condemnation from the opposition Congress party and others, who have accused him of reversing decades of Indian support for the Palestinian cause.
In a post on X after India condemned Israel’s actions in the occupied West Bank, Congress party’s general secretary in charge of communication and media, Jairam Ramesh, said: “This is sheer hypocrisy and cynicism since the PM will be going to Israel early next week. If he is really serious – which of course he is not – he should call out his good friend Mr Netanyahu, and publicly express India’s grave concern at what Israel is executing in the occupied West Bank.”
Analysts have told Al Jazeera that Modi will likely be “highly diplomatic” with respect to discussing the Palestine issue during his Israel trip.
According to Pethiyagoda, India has had a fairly unique position among large powers in maintaining cordial ties with both sides in most of the world’s major conflicts.
“But the timing of the [Israel] visit, when the US is likely to strike Iran, is not ideal in terms of maintaining this image,” he said, referring to soaring tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Trump administration has amassed warships and jets close to Iran, in preparation for a potential attack, even as the US and Iran also engage in diplomatic talks.
He added that during his visit, Modi will likely make reference to the Gaza conflict but “in a neutral, highly diplomatic way”.
Tshuva said beyond India’s engagement with the Palestinian leadership, its ties with Arab states remain strategically significant.
“Gulf countries are vital to India’s energy security, trade flows, investment partnerships and the welfare of millions of Indian nationals working in the region,” he said.
“These economic and geopolitical considerations form an essential part of New Delhi’s Middle East policy and shape its careful approach to the Israeli-Palestinian issue,” he added.

The Finnish men's ice hockey team defeated Slovakia by a score of 6–1 in the bronze medal match at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, bringing Finland's medal tally to six.
That number was the Finnish Olympic Committee's medal goal – a modest target set following the 2024 Paris summer games, when Finland for the first time ever failed to win a single medal.
Finland’s northern neighbour, Norway, has won the most medals at the Italian games, scooping up 40 as of Sunday morning, 18 of them gold. Another neighbour, Sweden, has racked up 16 medals.
The hockey medal is Finland's eighth in Olympic men's ice hockey, but its first medal in any men's international tournament since 2022.
The Lions won gold in Beijing 2022, silver in Calgary 1988 and Turin 2006, collecting bronze medals in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014.
Most medals in NHL-powered Olympic tournaments
This was the sixth time that NHL professionals took part in the Olympics, with Finland winning the most hockey medals at these Games, five. The Lions only went home empty-handed from the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics.
The Finnish men’s hockey team has never lost an Olympic bronze medal match.
It narrowly missed a spot in this year's final, having led 2–0 in the semi-final against Canada, but falling to a 2–3 defeat in the last minute on Friday.
On the final day of the Olympics, Canada and the United States play the all-North-American final, broadcast on Yle TV2 and Areena starting at 3pm Sunday.
Before that, three Finns take part in the women’s 50km classic cross-country ski race. They include Kerttu Niskanen, who won a bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics four years ago.
The closing ceremony starts at 9.30pm.

Trump curious why Iran hasn’t capitulated under US pressure

In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff says Trump is questioning why Tehran has not “capitulated” despite what he describes as significant US naval and sea power deployed in the region.
“The president asked me that this morning, and he’s — I don’t wanna use the word frustrated… because he understands he’s got plenty of alternatives, but… he’s curious as to why they haven’t, I don’t wanna use the word capitulated, but why they haven’t capitulated.”
Witkoff suggests that Washington expects Iran to formally state that it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline concrete steps to prove it.
Witkoff’s remarks come as Iranian officials have repeatedly stressed the peaceful nature of the country's nuclear program. Iran has constantly declared that it is not seeking nuclear weapons, stressing that its nuclear technology is solely for civil purposes. Also, there is a Fatwa by the Leader of the Islamic Revolution, which bans any possession and use of weapons of mass destruction.
Elsewhere in his remarks, Witkoff said that the US insists Iran give up uranium enrichment, adding that this is a red line in negotiations for Washington.
This is while Iranian officials have time and again stressed that they would in no circumstances accept any deal that demands zero enrichment inside the country. Also, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi recently said in an interview with MSNBC that the United States did not demand "zero uranium enrichment" from Iran in recent talks in Geneva. Iranian officials have repeatedly criticized American officials for their contradictory statements in negotiations and in media statements.

Blizzard warnings blanket US East Coast, including New York City
Nearly 30M people under alert as powerful northeaster expected to dump up to 2 feet of snow
ISTANBUL
Blizzard warnings have been issued across a wide stretch of the US East Coast as a powerful winter storm threatened to unleash heavy snow, strong winds, and coastal flooding from the Mid-Atlantic to New England.
The US National Weather Service said early Saturday that nearly 30 million people were under blizzard warnings from Sunday morning through Monday afternoon, including residents of New York City, where forecasters said snowfall could reach up to 18 inches, with as much as 2 feet possible in some areas.
The warnings span from Delaware to southern Connecticut, with the heaviest snowfall expected Sunday night into early Monday. Snowfall rates could exceed 1 to 2 inches per hour at times, according to the Weather Service.
It marks the first blizzard warning issued for New York City since 2017. The city last experienced a record-breaking snowfall in 2016, when 27.5 inches were recorded in Central Park, the highest total since record-keeping began in 1869.
Forecasters warned that sustained winds of 25-35 mph could reduce visibility to near zero and increase the risk of power outages and coastal flooding, according to The New York Times.
Travel conditions are expected to become “dangerous, if not impossible,” particularly during Monday morning and evening commutes in major cities, including Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.
Washington, DC, is forecast to see a mix of rain and snow early Sunday, transitioning to all snow by midday, with accumulations of up to 5 inches expected.
Philadelphia could receive up to 12 inches, while New York City and surrounding areas – including Long Island, northeastern New Jersey, and coastal and southern Connecticut – may see 15-20 inches or more, depending on the storm’s track.
Meteorologists described the system as a classic nor'easter, expected to develop off the coast of the Carolinas before rapidly intensifying as it tracks northward offshore.
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said sanitation crews were preparing more than 700 salt spreaders and outfitting 2,200 vehicles with plows ahead of the storm. A workforce of 2,600 employees, including 1,000 emergency snow shovelers, is scheduled to begin operations early Sunday.
The city is also inviting residents to sign up as paid emergency snow shovelers at local sanitation facilities as the storm begins.

NASA delays Artemis II moon mission to April over rocket system issue
Space agency rules out March launch window, targets early or late April for crewed lunar flight
ISTANBUL
NASA has delayed its Artemis II mission to the moon until at least April after engineers identified a new issue with the rocket’s helium system, the agency said Saturday.
The mission, initially scheduled for March 6, would have marked the first crewed lunar flight in more than 50 years. However, the problem detected during routine testing led mission managers to rule out the March launch window.
NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said the issue may involve a faulty filter, valve or connection plate. He said the only way to inspect and repair the affected area is to roll the 322-foot (98-meter) Space Launch System rocket back to its hangar at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
“We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration,” Isaacman said in a post on US-based social media platform X. He added that the next available launch opportunities would be in early or late April.
NASA said the latest issue is not related to previous hydrogen fuel leaks that delayed earlier launch attempts. A recent fueling test had cleared the mission for a possible March launch before the new problem emerged.
Artemis II is planned to send astronauts around the moon and back, marking the first such mission since NASA’s Apollo program ended in 1972. The Artemis program completed its first uncrewed lunar mission in 2022.

Ancient church frescoes and gilded gold: Exploring Polotsk Art Gallery's rich legacy

Today, the Art Gallery, one of the popular cultural institutions of ancient Polotsk, celebrates its 45th anniversary since founding. It is part of the National Polotsk Historical and Cultural Museum-Reserve and is housed in a building that was once part of the former Jesuit Collegium, an example of the 18th century architecture. Originally called the City Picture Gallery, it opened on 20 February 1981. On the eve of this milestone, BelTA reached out to the museum to talk about the rich legacy of the musuem.
Forty-five years ago, the building of the Epiphany Cathedral was given over to the Picture Gallery. In 1992, the cathedral was returned to the Polotsk Diocese, and the cultural institution moved to the nearby Museum of Belarusian Book Printing. The gallery found its current home in 2002, and the head of state participated in its opening. Now, across three floors of the former Jesuit Collegium building, visitors can see both permanent and rotating exhibitions. It also has its own art salon
Both Belarusians and international visitors come here to explore the rich cultural heritage of the past and the works of contemporary masters. Some visitors are interested only in archaeological finds, but there are also those who prefer guided tours of all the exhibition halls. The gallery has an influx of visitors in the summer. Here, you can use an audio guide to independently explore the gallery's collections or wander through the halls with a tour guide. Additionally, detailed information is posted at the entrance to each hall, describing what is on display - art movements, authors, historical features, and painting styles. According to the staff, a full examination of the exhibits typically takes up to three hours on average.To mark the gallery’s 45th anniversary, an exhibition of contemporary artists has been mounted. “The First Quarter” exposition presents a collection of 50 works created between 2000 and 2025, i.e. the first quarter of the 21st century.
The gallery’s second floor showcases an exhibition of paintings by 20th-century Belarusian artists. The collection spans Realism, Socialist Realism, the so-called severe style of the 1950s and 1960s, as well as individual collections of works distinguished by their own unique techniques.
The first floor features specimens of the 19th-century ancient iconography and murals uncovered during the restoration of the Transfiguration Church on the grounds of the St. Euphrosyne Convent.
The oldest artifact and one of the gallery’s most valuable archaeological items is the icon “Saints Constantine and Helena.” It dates back to the 12th century. The stone icon is made of soapstone and was discovered in 1967 during excavations at the St. Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk. The icon depicts Saint Constantine the Great, Equal-to-the-Apostles, the Roman Emperor during whose reign Christianity became the dominant religion in the empire, and his mother, Helena, canonized for her work spreading Christianity. During his lifetime, the emperor venerated the Holy Cross and provided funds for his mother’s pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Helena, along with Macarius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, recovered the True Cross from Mount Golgotha, and thus, in 326, the Christian world acquired this relic.
Another example of ancient church art is a 12th-century engolpion cross, intended to hold the relics of saints. It was also found during archaeological excavations in Polotsk.
The icon collection includes items donated by residents of Polotsk and Polotsk District. The best-preserved icons are those cast in copper, typically used in Old Believer communities, where they sought to create images from materials that could travel well and were relatively lightweight. According to their belief, anything that had been treated with fire was considered consecrated. In the gallery, one can also find examples of icons with wooden covers, which could easily be mistaken for metal ones due to being overlaid with gold leaf. This openwork carving, characteristic of Belarusian craftsmen, has brought them fame beyond the country’s borders. In addition, works by local amateur masters are also on display here.

The most popular exhibit among visitors is the 19th-century mural
painting. “It was removed during the restoration of the Transfiguration
Church, a 12th-century structure. Initially, the church walls were
completely covered with frescoes, applied using water-based paints. They
had to be applied to wet plaster so the paint would be fully absorbed.
Over time, these frescoes darkened, and in the 19th century, it was
decided to repaint them, covering them with new paintings. Since it was
impossible to replicate the frescoes in their original form, they were
repainted using oil paint, which creates a kind of film. In 1885, the
first layer of painting was done, meaning all the 12th-century
monumental art was covered, and then, 50 years later, a second stage of
restoration took place,” the gallery staff explained.
When
restoration work began in 1992, the question arose of how to preserve
the impressive 19th-century wall paintings. For this project, Belarusian
specialists, together with a team of Russian restorers, developed a
special technique that made it possible to detach the oil paint and
transfer it onto a prepared backing. Today, the fruits of this
meticulous, 20-year endeavor are on display at the Art Gallery, offering
visitors a chance to appreciate the truly monumental work done by these
masters of their craft.
“There is no other exhibition like this anywhere in Belarus,” the cultural workers assured. It is for its uniqueness that visitors, both residents and visitors of Polotsk, value it most of all.

Hong Kong official warns of lower payout if Tai Po fire victims reject buy-back plan
Deputy finance chief Michael Wong urges Wang Fuk Court flat owners to ‘make a wise decision’ or face lower compensation under possible legislation
The acquisition price for properties damaged in Hong Kong’s deadly Tai Po fire will be “far lower” if homeowners reject the government’s buy-back offer and authorities are forced to use legislation to acquire the remaining properties, a senior official has said.
Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun on Sunday dismissed claims that the government was using public funds to cover its responsibility for the Tai Po tragedy, following online criticism that taxpayers’ money was being used to support individual property owners.
The government is expected to spend about HK$6.8 billion (US$870 million) to buy back damaged flats at Wang Fuk Court, offering HK$8,000 or HK$10,500 per square foot. Of that total, HK$2.8 billion will come from a dedicated support fund, with the remaining HK$4 billion drawn from public coffers.
Wong said the proposal was a compassionate arrangement aimed at helping owners purchase a new home, warning that otherwise they might lose their investment without significant government intervention.
“Society should look at it comprehensively,” he said on a radio show.
In a separate television interview, Wong added the proposal represented an “appropriate use” of public money, stressing that the Wang Fuk Court case was “exceptional” and would not set a precedent.

Chef, 34, arrested for allegedly spraying unknown liquid on 3 women in Hong Kong
Suspect apprehended on Saturday over three separate incidents near Tai Wai MTR station during Christmas and Lunar New Year holidays
A 34-year-old chef has been arrested for allegedly dripping an unknown liquid on three female pedestrians near Hong Kong’s Tai Wai MTR station in separate incidents during the Christmas and Lunar New Year holiday periods.
The first incident took place on Christmas morning, when a woman crossing a footbridge on Mei Tin Road felt liquid dripping on her hair and saw a man running away from her soon after.
Police arrested the man on suspicion of common assault on January 8 and later released him on bail.
Another woman reported that her hair and jacket were found to be wet with an unknown liquid after she walked past Sin Sam House in Lung Hang Estate on the first night of Lunar New Year on Tuesday.
On Thursday morning, a third victim discovered liquid on her hair at Che Kung Temple Road Playground. She, too, saw a man fleeing the scene.
The chef, a Sha Tin resident, was again arrested – this time for loitering – on Saturday morning.

US, South Korea postpone announcement of date for major springtime military drills
It comes due to coordination issues over on-field exercises, as Seoul seeks to minimize on-field training while Washington reportedly expressed disapproval
ISTANBUL
The US and South Korean militaries have decided to postpone announcing a date for their major springtime exercise for this year due to differences over the scale of on-field drills, the Seoul-based Yonhap News reported on Sunday.
The two militaries had planned to make the announcement in a joint press briefing Wednesday, but it was postponed after the US military expressed reluctance over Seoul's proposal to minimize field training during the Freedom Shield exercise, the news agency reported, citing security sources.
The Freedom Shield drill takes place every spring under an all-out war scenario as the allies seek to enhance readiness against North Korea's "advancing nuclear and weapons programs."
President Lee Jae Myung's administration has sought to scale back the allies' on-field drills in an apparent reconciliatory gesture to Pyongyang, which has long denounced them as preparations for an invasion against it.
The announcement was postponed due to coordination issues over on-field exercises as Seoul seeks to minimize on-field training.
The US military, however, has reportedly expressed disapproval of South Korea's proposal, as additional troops and equipment have already arrived in the country to take part in the drills.
The two sides plan to coordinate further and announce the exercise later this month or in early March.
According to Seoul's Defense Ministry, the Freedom Shield exercise, planned for March, "will take place normally."

It's on: US and Canada face off for Olympic gold in men's hockey as Winter Games come to a close
The U.S. and Canada meet in the men's gold-medal hockey game at the Winter Olympics after each went 5-0 to advance
- Bookmark
It had to be the U.S. and Canada for Olympic gold.
As the 4 Nations Face-Off a year ago showed, the North American powerhouses are atop the hockey world on the international stage. They proved it at this tournament, with the U.S. going through Sweden and Canada getting past Czechia and Finland to make the most-anticipated final possible happen.
A gold medal would still mean everything to the players and coaches involved, but it feels right to have the two border rivals as the last teams standing in Milan.
“If you’re going to get through to your goal, you’re going to probably have to go through them at some point," U.S. winger Matthew Tkachuk said. "They’ve had the success in pretty much all the Olympics that NHL players have been going to. Two great teams, and I can only speak for ourselves, we’re just so excited for this opportunity, honored to represent our country and honored to be in this position.”
Canada won the past two Olympics where NHL players participated, in 2010 and 2014. The U.S. has not taken home gold in men's hockey since the 1980 “Miracle on Ice" team.
That's ancient history. These countries have more recent history from two epic 4 Nations games, including the first one that opened with three fights in nine seconds. Fighting is not allowed at the Olympics, though Canada's Tom Wilson didn't care about the automatic ejection when he dropped the gloves against France.
“There’s no fighting (but) I expect a hard-fought game, the same as it was the last two times we played them,” U.S. forward J.T. Miller said.
Canada may be shorthanded: Captain Sidney Crosby left the quarterfinal game against Czechia with an apparent right knee injury and did not play in the semifinal against Finland, when his teammates rallied from a two-goal deficit to advance to the final.
The U.S. should be at full strength after winger Tage Thompson — tied for the team lead in goals with three — left the semifinal against Slovakia after blocking a shot. Thompson is expected to be good to go for what is the biggest game of a lot of players' careers.
“Everybody that’s playing is going to be 50 years old one day, not playing in the NHL anymore and playing thousands of games hopefully, and you’re going to remember start to finish a handful of games,” Tkachuk said. "This is probably one of them.”

Missiles Pound Kyiv Ahead Of Russian Invasion Anniversary
Unknown

17:10:02 KST

Explosions rocked Ukraine's capital Kyiv early on Sunday with officials warning of a ballistic missile attack, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion.
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4:00 am, shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert warning nationwide citing the threat of missiles.
"The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons," the head of Kyiv's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram, urging people to remain in shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that two wounded people, a woman and a child, were rushed to hospitals from the suburbs.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults on energy and military infrastructure.
Temperatures had plunged to nearly minus 10 degrees Celsius when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
Tkachenko said the attacks had caused a fire on the roof of a residential building.
The bombardment prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Poland's Operational Command said early Sunday it was scrambling jets after detecting "long‑range aviation of the Russian Federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine."
It also came hours after blasts in Lviv, a western city near the Polish border that rarely sees deadly attacks.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and injuring 15 people after officers responded to a reported break‑in.
"This is clearly an act of terrorism," Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
Ukraine 'not losing'
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia's assault on February 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine was "definitely not losing" the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometres of territory in recent counter‑attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv's most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Elon Musk following a plea from Kyiv, have enabled the push, according to Zelensky.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.
Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, said on X on Saturday he planned consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wanted deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Turkey.
A Message from The Moscow Times:

Poppy thieves steal thousands of plants from Victorian farm, sparking health warning

Poppy thieves steal thousands of plants from Victorian farm, sparking health warning
Thieves stole about 1700 alkaloid poppy plants from a farm in the Ballarat area earlier this month prompting health experts to warn the plant’s products could kill people.
Ballarat detectives are investigating the thefts that happened sometime between February 14 and 16.
Police have “strongly discouraged” anyone from handling, transporting or experimenting with the plants due to the life-threatening levels of toxicity.
The plants were grown for pharmaceutical use only, and at least 40 people were hospitalised with life-threatening conditions after drinking tea made from this type of poppy in recent years.
A drug alert from the Victorian Department of Health on Saturday said these poppy plants only have tiny trace amounts of opioids and can cause seizures and other issues.
“These poppies are very different from traditional opioid poppies and contain dangerously high concentrations of thebaine and oripavine, with risk of life-threatening toxicity. They contain only tiny (‘trace’) amounts of traditional opioids like morphine and codeine,” the alert said.
“Thebaine is very different from the opioids in traditional opium poppies.
“Thebaine does not produce pain relief, sedation or euphoria. Thebaine stimulates the nervous system and can lead to seizures, high body temperature, and life-threatening toxicity. Any exposure to thebaine may cause toxicity.”
Thebaine is used in the industrial manufacture of some drugs, among other uses.
The alert further warns people that the toxicity caused by these plants will not be reversed by the life-saving Naxolone that is used for treating opioid overdoses.
“Oripavine can produce opioid-like effects such as sedation, slowed breathing, and small pupils. However, oripavine is not used medically because it can also cause severe toxicity (agitation, seizures) and life-threatening complications at high doses,” it read.
“The effects may be unpredictable, particularly when combined with thebaine.
“Naloxone will reverse the opioid effects of oripavine but will not reverse the toxic stimulant effects. Naloxone will not reverse thebaine toxicity.”
At least 40 people experienced life-threatening symptoms from these kinds of products in 2022-2023.
“Poppy plant products may include dried flower heads (without petals), ground poppy-plant material, or liquid preparations derived from poppy plants. These products may contain high concentrations of thebaine and oripavine that lead to life-threatening toxicity,” the alert said.
“In 2022-2023 at least 40 people experienced life-threatening effects following consumption of thebaine-contaminated poppy seed ‘tea’ – including agitation, muscle twitching, high body temperature and seizures.”
Police continue to investigate the thefts and they have urged anyone who may have witnessed the thefts or has vision or information to contact them anonymously at crimestoppersvic.com.au or phone 1800 333 000.

Terrorist attack in Lviv: Police officer killed, 24 people injured
The Lviv regional police announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
The officer killed in the attack was 23-year-old Viktoriia Shpylka.
"She was originally from the Volyn region and later moved with her parents to Kherson. She chose the path of serving people – she graduated from Lviv State University of Internal Affairs and joined the patrol police. She first served in the Kherson region and, since 2023, in the Lviv region," the police said.
A patrol police service vehicle and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
Preliminary reports indicate that improvised explosive devices detonated.
"At around 00:30 today, a report was received on the 102 emergency line about a break-in at a store on Danylyshyna Street. After a patrol police crew arrived at the scene, an explosion occurred. Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off," the statement said.
According to Maksym Kozytskyi, head of the Lviv Regional Military Administration, some of the injured are in serious condition.

Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday.
The overnight strikes hit Kiev and the region around the capital, the Black Sea port Odessa and central Ukraine, they said. At least one person was injured in the Kiev region, with damage reported in five districts where more than a dozen houses were damaged, regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on the Telegram messaging app.
Odessa Governor Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram that a nighttime drone attack on the energy infrastructure of the region caused fires that had been extinguished.
Russia attacks the Ukrainian energy system almost daily, striking thermal power plants and electrical substations.
Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector are important elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.
"Russia continues to undermine diplomacy with terrorist mass strikes," Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said on X.
"This terror cannot be normalised; it must be stopped. Russia cannot wag the world, just as the tail cannot wag the dog," he said, calling on the international community to impose tough sanctions against the Kremlin.

Explosion in Lviv
Separately, one police officer was killed and 24 other people were injured after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called the incident a terrorist act.

China amps up electric ships in push to decarbonise waterways, leverage EV prowess
Twin strengths, battery technology and shipbuilding, are being fused to electrify maritime transport, moving beyond short-haul passenger vessels to commercial cargo
Having electrified its highways, China is mobilising its shipbuilding prowess and battery giants such as CATL to overhaul some shipping fleets, betting that the revolution in green transport can float as well as it drives.
The shift towards clean energy underscores Beijing’s broader decarbonisation commitment – vowing to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve neutrality by 2060. These goals have spurred substantial strides in renewable capacity installation, end-use revamps, new technology development and carbon trading.
More than 1,000 vessels powered by electricity or alternative fuels are currently operating on China’s vast network of inland waterways, including 485 e-vessels, most of which are river passenger ships, according to data from the Ministry of Transport.
However, some governments and companies are pivoting towards the development of electric cargo vessels, moving beyond short-haul passenger ships but largely confining this shift for now to domestic waterways rather than international deep-sea freight.
Fujian Shipbuilding Industry Group launched a pure-electric cargo ship on February 7. Designed to transport up to 1,000 tonnes of freight on the Min River, the vessel boasts a 200km (124-mile) range on a single charge.
Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world’s largest EV battery producer, has partnered with Jining Energy, a state-owned firm in Shandong province, to develop electric vessels with a 2,000-tonne load capacity and a range of up to 270km (158 miles) on a single charge. Five units were launched in December, with Jining Energy placing orders for an additional 50 ships.

Japan youth share photos to show before and after cosmetic surgeries, raise copycat concerns
AI-generated before and after images posted online raise fears about promoting risky procedures; warping youngsters ideas about beauty
Young people in Japan are using artificial intelligence (AI) to make before-and-after cosmetic surgery photographs which look like they are two “different” versions of themselves in a single setting.
Data suggests the country is relatively relaxed about cosmetic procedures, but the latest trend is raising concerns about the effect it might have on youngsters.
According to the Japan Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the country logged about 3.3 million aesthetic medical procedures in 2022, making it one of the world’s biggest markets.
Compared with South Korea, known for cutting-edge, trend-led treatments, Japan’s industry is often associated with precision and subtle, natural-looking results.
This month, a Japanese online user called @rori_bb went viral after posting an AI-made “two-shot” that placed her current face beside her pre-surgery self. She captioned that she compared the two and ended up crying.
The post racked up 15.8 million views and sparked a wave of copycat images across social media.

Many cleaning products contain harmful ingredients

According to the Christian trade union ACV, many cleaning agents that we use every day contain chemical that could be harmful to our health. The union commissioned research into the risks posed to the health of domestic cleaners by the use of cleaning agents.
The research concludes that domestic cleaners in particular have an increased risk of lung and heart problems. The Leuven University (KU Leuven) Professor of Occupation Medicine Lode Godderis told the VRT’s consumer team ‘WinWin’ that “The impact is often underestimated”. ‘WinWin’ examined which chemicals are used to make the products we use every day to clean our homes.
Karolien from Minderhout (Antwerp Province) works as a domestic cleaner. She told ‘WinWin’ that she suffers health issues such as skin irritations.
"I only started wearing gloves once my fingers had completely dried up in the evening”. She find that the smell of the products is too strong and she tries not to inhale it. “But I don’t know exactly what is in them”. Karolien is not the only domestic cleaner that has issue. Many other have similar medical complaints. They don’t always have a say in the products that they have to use in their work.
Skin complaints and lung problems
A large-scale study conducted in 2023 by the Christian trade union ACV shows that shows that a strikingly large group of domestic cleaners suffer from health issues that are directly linked to their daily exposure to cleaning products.
33% of the domestic cleaners surveyed reported having skin problems. In addition to this 28% said that they suffer from lung and respiratory problems. Coughing, tightness of the chest, shortness of breath, and even headaches are remarkably common among those employed as cleaners and complaints of this nature are more common than among those with other kinds of job.
Professor Lode Godderis (KU Leuven) told the VRT that
Many traditional cleaning products contain a mixture of chemical ingredients that have an impact on our health. “It is this that causes irritation to the lungs, making you cough or become short of breath. It can also cause allergies and even asthma,” says Professor Godderis says. According to Mr Godderis, aerosol cleaning products are particularly harmful: “With these products you inhale more. It is better to add a cleaning product to a bucket of water than to spray it.”
Endocrine disruptors
But what exactly is in the cleaning products? Solvents ensure that a product evaporates quickly. Detergents and disinfectants are designed to combat dirt and bacteria and foam boosters make the whole thing look more effective and give us the impression that a floor or other surface is clean more quickly even if this is not always necessarily the case.
In addition to this, there are preservatives that extend shelf life and fragrances that make the room that has been cleaned smell nice. It is these fragrant components, such as limonene that can be particularly irritating, especially to people that are exposed to them on a daily basis.
Protect yourself, your family and your cleaner
ACV has provided a list of tips to help protect yourself, your family and if you have one your clear from the harmful effects of overexposure to cleaning agents.
Provide gloves for your cleaning assistant
Avoid aggressive products and sprays
Consider using alternative cleaning products, such as vinegar, ecological soap (Marseille soap) and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
Use eco-friendly products that don’t contain harmful chemicals.

Are indoor cats less happy than outdoor cats?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

17:00:00 KST

A question that many cat-owners ask themselves is whether or not to allow their pet outside. But is it necessary to allow a cat out to explore with the risks this entails not only for cat itself (traffic, fights with other cats…), but also for the local fauna? Is a cat as happy living its live indoors as it would be if it were an outdoor cat?
The cat behaviour therapist Anneleen Bru says that every cat is different.
"Not every cat is by definition an animal that needs to go outside”. Anneleen Bru adds that we shouldn’t assume that an indoor cat is less happy than an outdoor cat.
"Each cat is unique and not every cat would preffer to be outside rather than indoors. You also can’t just turn an outdoor cat into an indoor cat. It always depends on the individual situation”.
Nevertheless, Anneleen Bru told VRT Radio 2 that there are some telltale signs in a cat’s behaviour that show its owner whether they have taken the right decision by keeping their pet indoors or allowing it out.
Beware of “the zoomies”
There’s a thing that exists that is known as locomotor play. This is when your cat plays with its surroundings and, for example, literally flies back and forth over your furniture or runs up and down the stairs.
This is also known as “the zoomies”. Cats that really engage this type of play benefit from being able to go outside, climb trees and explore their surroundings”, Anneleen Bru explains. “You really see them blossom. When they’re allowed out"
Read your cat’s body language
You can also learn a lot from your cat’s body language. “Look at your cat’s whiskers. If they are pointing forwards, your cat is happy. If they are pointing back your cat feels ill at ease”.
A cat’s tail also tells you a lot about its mood. “If the tail is upright or like a question mark, you have a happy cat. Your cat is not happy if its tail is pointing down it is not happy. You can learn a lot by looking at a cat’s whiskers and its tail.
If you notice that your cat often hides or seeks solitude or that it often acts afraid. “Then this is a sign of chronic stress. In this case it would be a good idea to look and your cat’s living quarters”.
Always take your cat’s behaviour into account
Annelene Bru stresses that ultimately the decision lies with the cat owner “This also differs from person to person. Consider where you live and to what extent it is feasible or safe to let your cat outside.
If you live near to a busy road, you may be more inclined to keep your pet indoors. Other cat owners, however, cannot bring themselves to deprive their cat of its freedom. Whatever you decide, should always take your cat's behavior into account.

The reason you don’t exercise – and the best way to overcome it
In the latest Well Enough newsletter, Harry Bullmore explores why we struggle to turn good intentions into regular exercise – and how ‘exercise snacking’ and other small, expert-backed habits can deliver meaningful health gains without the all-or-nothing overhaul

The article below is an excerpt from my newsletter: Well Enough with Harry Bullmore. To get my latest thoughts on fitness and wellbeing pop your email address into the box above to get the newsletter direct to your inbox.
In today’s newsletter we’re going to attempt to solve one of the biggest health and fitness conundrums going: “We know exercise is good for us, so why don’t we do more of it?”
My inspiration came from a PureGym survey that fell into my inbox a few days ago. It found that “76 per cent of adults aspire to be fit and healthy”, but “only three in 10 people in the UK meet recommended weekly activity levels”.
Few, if any, people set out to live an unhealthy life – I’d wager most actively chase the opposite. But there’s a significant disconnect between wanting to be fitter and actually doing the things we know will get us there. Why?
To answer this, I like to look at exercise like a detective in a crime drama – people need motive, means and opportunity. It requires enough gumption to get out of the door; the time, energy and resources to take part; and a conducive environment to keep going.
These criteria are hard to hit in 2026, courtesy of a cost of living crisis, increasingly busy schedules, and alternatives to exercise (phones, social media, streaming services and so on) being specifically engineered to steal your time.
There’s no absolute solution to this, but we can shrink the obstacles standing in our way to make them easier to overcome. To do this, the best expert-backed method I’ve encountered is exercise snacking.
The premise is simple: short bursts of equipment-free activity that can test your muscles and get you out of breath, spread throughout the day in digestible chunks lasting no more than five minutes. For example, climbing a few flights of stairs at a brisk pace or performing a series of squats and press-ups at your desk – this article has plenty of ideas to help you get started.
For most, this no-cost approach tends to be more palatable than a string of hour-long gym trips or lengthy runs. Exercise snacking also breaks up lengthy periods of sitting down, which can have bonus health benefits, according to recent research from Brunel University London.
“The concept of ‘exercise snacks’ has genuine research support,” Jack McNamara, clinical exercise physiology course leader at the University of East London, told me in a recent interview.
“The evidence suggests those snacks are most effective when they’re vigorous enough to elevate heart rate meaningfully and when they’re part of a broader pattern of regular physical activity. For the many who cite lack of time as their main barrier to exercise, knowing that a few minutes here and there genuinely counts could be transformative.”
This advice is less for seasoned exercise veterans and more for those who struggle to squeeze movement into their regular routine.
If you are in this latter group and can factor three or more five-minute bursts of exercise into each day, you will have strengthened muscles across your entire body and accumulated 105 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (exercise that gets you breathless) by the end of the week.
This is in excess of the NHS physical activity guidelines of “at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity a week”. If you can accumulate a decent number of daily steps too, you could transform your health.
To what extent? For this query, I spoke to University of Sydney researchers Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis and Dr Nicholas Koemel. Their work confirms that small positive changes can have a disproportionately impressive impact on how you look, feel and function.
Their large-scale study found that, for those with poor sleep, diet and exercise levels, an extra half-portion of fruit or vegetables, 96 seconds of exercise and 15 minutes of sleep per day could measurably improve health and longevity.
“These are accessible and manageable changes that can make a significant difference if people incorporate them, ideally simultaneously, into their lives in the long term,” says Professor Stamatakis.
Much of his research revolves around finding accessible pathways to better health for those who don’t currently exercise. This group, he says, “is at the highest risk of chronic disease and compromised lives”
“It’s about giving options to the 80 or 85 per cent of the population who are not keen on doing regular, structured exercise,” he adds. “It’s not an optimal fitness solution – if you want to become fully fit, of course structured exercise is the best way to go, but it comes with major commitments.
“We want to lower the bar of participation and lower the bar of getting benefit from movement.”
In summary: if you’ve already built a regular exercise habit, you are pulling one of the biggest levers available for better health. If you struggle to squeeze gym sessions and other beneficial behaviours into each week, just know that the threshold for making meaningful changes to your health is likely far lower than you think. Or, to nick an old Tesco slogan: “Every little helps.”

Lithuanian teenager builds record-breaking snowman
Unknown

17:00:00 KST

A 10th-grade student from the small town of Semeliškės has built what is believed to be Lithuania’s tallest snowman, reaching a height of 6.9 metres after weeks of work in freezing winter conditions.
Rokas Rulevičius, 16, from Semeliškės in the Elektrėnai municipality, spent hours each day since January constructing the massive snowman in his family’s yard. After returning from school, he would head straight outside to continue building before starting his homework. On some days, he worked four to five hours, and up to eight hours on weekends.
Even on a day when schools were closed due to record-low temperatures, Rulevičius continued working outdoors.
The idea of building a colossal snowman had been on his mind for years. In 2019, he tried constructing one with his family, reaching about 2.5 meters before melting snow halted the effort. He made another attempt on his own in 2022, but said the conditions – or perhaps his enthusiasm – were not sufficient for an impressive result.
This winter, however, brought unusually cold and snowy weather, and Rulevičius decided not to miss the opportunity.
At first, when the snow was sticky enough to hold its shape, he carried it in buckets, building the structure layer by layer. Each circular layer required 24 buckets of snow, with each bucket holding 25 litres. He built at least a dozen such layers.
As the base grew taller and the snow became less adhesive, he adapted his approach. Rulevičius constructed a frame from a metal fence and filled it with snow, watering it with a watering can to help it freeze into place. While refining his technique, the structure developed a slight lean.
As the snowman rose higher, he needed a ladder to continue. Recent icy conditions also made the work more challenging. Although there was plenty of snow, he had to clear a large area of nearby fields to gather enough material.
His parents did not discourage him, though they occasionally asked whether the snowman might already be tall enough. Rulevičius persisted until he surpassed the previous national record.
The tallest snowman previously recorded in Lithuania was built in 2019 and measured 6.7 metres. Rulevičius’ creation exceeds that mark by at least 20 centimetres. The new record has not yet been officially registered but is expected to be submitted soon.
The towering snowman now stands as tall as the roof of a nearby farm building. While it is not clearly visible from the town centre, visitors have already begun stopping by to see and photograph it.
“I’m happy that I managed to achieve this result and that I did it all with my own hands,” Rulevičius said. “I think it was more useful than sitting at a computer.”

Beijing monitors Australian frigate HMAS Toowoomba’s passage through Taiwan Strait
Anzac-class frigate “conducted a routine transit through the South China Sea”, Australian defence department says
The Global Times, a nationalist newspaper affiliated with the Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily, reported the vessel’s passage on Saturday, citing a Chinese military source.
“[The Toowoomba’s] shipborne helicopter approached the median line of the strait in the afternoon, and the Taiwan military immediately issued a radio warning to drive it away,” the report said.
Reuters on Sunday quoted an unnamed Australian government source as confirming that the warship sailed through the strait on Friday and Saturday.
The transit drew criticism from military enthusiasts on mainland Chinese social media.
A day earlier, the Australian Department of Defence said the Toowoomba, an Anzac-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy, had “conducted a routine transit through the South China Sea in accordance with international law”.

Israeli members of Trump’s Board of Peace vow Hamas will disarm 'one way or another'

Senior political and security figures in Israel are expressing skepticism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s vision for Gaza, even as details unveiled at the first meeting of a newly formed Board of Peace point to an ambitious international effort to link reconstruction to the full disarmament of Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union.
Some officials have described the initiative as naïve, particularly regarding the roles assigned by Trump to envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. But participants in the inaugural gathering said the plan reflects months of coordination among American, Israeli, Arab and European figures and could represent what they call a historic opportunity to reshape Gaza if security conditions are met.
The Board of Peace includes U.S. officials such as Witkoff, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as well as retired American generals and international figures including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Representatives from most Arab states are involved, alongside Palestinian representatives selected with the backing of regional governments, including Israel. Organizers said those Palestinian factions have no direct or indirect ties to Hamas.
The Israeli contingent includes businessman Yakir Gabay, technology entrepreneur Liran Tancman and investor Michael Eisenberg, who serves as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s representative at a U.S. coordination headquarters in Kiryat Gat and is described by participants as a full partner in the board’s work.
Gabay, described by colleagues as hawkish on security matters, said reconstruction funds would not be released unless Hamas fully disarms.
“Not a single dollar can be transferred and no valve can be opened unless Hamas lays down its weapons. That is nonnegotiable,” he said in closed forums, according to participants.
A key element pressed by Israeli representatives is reform of school textbooks in Gaza to promote tolerance and halt incitement against Israel, a condition they describe as no less important than dismantling Hamas’ weapons.
In remarks at the board’s opening session, Gabay outlined what he called a comprehensive rebuilding plan.
“Gaza is destroyed. We have gathered here on a historic day with a shared vision to build Gaza for future generations,” he said. The plan calls for clearing and recycling an estimated 70 million tons of rubble and unexploded ordnance, dismantling hundreds of kilometers of tunnels, providing rapid temporary housing and beginning permanent infrastructure projects.
According to Gabay, proposals include modern hospitals, schools, factories, agricultural zones, roads, rail lines, energy facilities, water infrastructure, data centers, a seaport and an airport. He said contractors who have built millions of homes across the Middle East would be recruited at competitive prices and that funding commitments are already in place.
He added that Gaza’s coastline could be developed into a “Middle Eastern Riviera” with up to 200 hotels and potential artificial islands, with profits directed to Gaza residents. All development, he said, would remain conditional on demilitarization and the disarmament of Hamas.
Kushner told participants the initiative is structured like a private-sector board meeting, with members reporting on opportunities and challenges.
“We cannot change the past, but we can change the future if we focus the right way,” he said. “Failure is not an option.”
U.S. investor Marc Rowan presented financial projections, saying the reconstruction effort would begin in Rafah with a goal of rebuilding the city within three years. Plans include constructing 100,000 homes for 500,000 residents in the first phase, with $5 billion invested in infrastructure. Over time, he said, 400,000 homes would be built across Gaza, alongside $30 billion in infrastructure investment.
Rowan estimated the total potential value of real estate and infrastructure at $115 billion, arguing that the main obstacle is not funding but security and political stability.
Organizers said $6.5 billion has already been pledged, including $1.2 billion from the United Arab Emirates, $1 billion from Qatar, $1.25 billion from the United States and additional funding from Kuwait and the World Bank. Trump announced that the United States would contribute an additional $10 billion. European Union representatives attended as observers but have not yet committed funds.
Central to the plan is a proposal for Hamas to surrender its weapons in stages — first heavy weaponry, then tunnel infrastructure and finally small arms. Under the proposal, individual Hamas members who turn in weapons would receive financial compensation and amnesty. Board officials said they expect a decision from Hamas in March, with disarmament potentially beginning in April.
An International Stabilization Force is expected to deploy initially at the Rafah crossing in May. U.S. officials said 20,000 troops have been pledged by five Muslim-majority countries: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania, with the possibility of expanding the force if needed.
In parallel, organizers are establishing a new Palestinian police force that would begin with 2,000 officers and eventually expand to 12,000. Officials said recruits are being trained in Jordan and Egypt and will not include individuals with a background in terrorism. The goal, they said, is “one weapon and one authority.”
A senior board official said the timeline envisions rebuilding Rafah within three years and completing Gaza’s broader reconstruction within a decade. Plans include a rail network, potentially a monorail or tram system, and linking Gaza as a logistics hub to the Gulf, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel, with trade routes extending to Europe.
The official emphasized that progress depends entirely on Hamas’ response.
“It is very binary,” he said. “On the positive track, everything moves forward. On the negative track, nothing happens.”
He added that the Palestinian Authority would not play a direct role in Gaza’s reconstruction but remains a relevant entity that could potentially integrate in the future if it meets governance benchmarks.

Brazil’s Lula urges Trump to treat all countries equally
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW DELHI - Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva urged US President Donald Trump on Feb 22 to treat all countries equally after the Republican leader imposed a 15 per cent tariff on imports following an adverse Supreme Court ruling.
“I want to tell the US President Donald Trump that we don’t want a new Cold War. We don’t want interference in any other country, we want all countries to be treated equally,” Mr Lula told reporters in New Delhi.
The conservative-majority Supreme Court ruled six to three on Feb 20
Mr Lula said he would not like to react to the Supreme Court decisions of another country, but hoped that Brazil’s relations with the United States “will go back to normalcy” soon.
The veteran leftist leader is expected to travel to Washington in March for a meeting with Mr Trump.
“I am convinced that Brazil-US relation will go back to normalcy after our conversation,” Mr Lula, 80, said, adding that Brazil only wanted to “live in peace, generate jobs, and improve the lives of our people”.
Mr Lula and Mr Trump, 79, stand on polar opposite sides when it comes to issues such as multilateralism, international trade and the fight against climate change.
However, ties between Brazil and the United States appear to be on the mend after months of animosity between Washington and Brasilia.
As a result, Mr Trump’s administration has exempted key Brazilian exports from 40 per cent tariffs that had been imposed on the South American country in 2025.
‘Affinity’
“The world doesn’t need more turbulence, it needs peace,” said Mr Lula, who arrived in India on Feb 18 for a summit on artificial intelligence and a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Ties between Washington and Brasilia soured in recent months, with Mr Trump angered over the trial and conviction of his ally, the far-right former Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro.
Mr Trump imposed sanctions against several top officials, including a Supreme Court judge, to punish Brazil for what he termed a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison
Mr Lula said that, as the two largest democracies in the Americas, he looked forward to a positive relationship with the United States.
“We are two men of 80 years of age, so we cannot play around with democracy,” he said.
“We have to take this very seriously. We have to shake hands eye-to-eye, person-to-person, and to discuss what is best for the US and Brazil.”
Mr Lula also praised Mr Modi after India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths and signed a raft of other deals on Feb 21.
“I have a lot of affinity with Prime Minister Modi,” he said.
Mr Lula will travel to South Korea later on Feb 22 for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum. AFP

Trump's envoy Witkoff says Zelenskyy-Putin meeting possible in coming weeks
US President Donald Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has suggested that "good news" on ending Russia's war against Ukraine could emerge in the coming weeks and has not ruled out a summit between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Source: Witkoff in an interview with Fox News, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Witkoff said Ukraine and Russia are engaged in a "silly war" over territory.
"You know, everyone throws the word 'dignity' around. But what does dignity get you if you have that amount of killing?"
"They [Ukraine and Russia – ed.] don't seem like they really want to fight with one another, and I don't think they do," Witkoff said.
He suggested that the main difficulty in reaching peace lies "at the leadership levels" of the two states.
Quote: "We are hopeful, Jared [Kushner] and I, that – we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between Zelenskyy and President Putin." [N.B. Ukrainska Pravda does not recognise Putin as president – ed.]
Details: Witkoff did not rule out that Donald Trump could join such a meeting but added that the US president "does not want to come to a meeting unless he feels that he can consummate this thing and get the best result".
"And he uniquely has that power to do it. So hopefully you will be hearing some good news in the coming weeks," the envoy added.
Background:
- Following trilateral meetings in Geneva on 17-18 February, Zelenskyy said he sees progress in the military area of the talks but not in the political one.
- On 20 February, Zelenskyy said another round of talks with Russia and the US on ending the war could take place before the end of the month.
- He also accused Russia of dragging out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage.

Rondale Moore, Vikings NFL receiver, dies aged 25
Police say the ex-Purdue University star died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound in his hometown in Indiana.
Rondale Moore, the National Football League (NFL) receiver who suffered season-ending training camp knee injuries in each of the last two years after a standout college career at Purdue and a promising start with the Arizona Cardinals, was found dead on Saturday, authorities say.
Police said Moore, aged 25, died of a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound. Moore was found dead in the garage of a property in his hometown of New Albany, police chief Todd Bailey said. The death remains under investigation.

Floyd County Coroner Matthew Tomlin confirmed Moore’s death. He said an autopsy would be conducted on Sunday.
After being traded to the Atlanta Falcons in 2024, Moore dislocated his right knee during training camp and never played for them. He signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2025, but he injured his left knee while returning a punt in their first exhibition game and spent another full season on injured reserve. Moore was so distraught after immediately realising the seriousness of that injury that he slammed his hand down on a cart so hard the sound was audible throughout the stadium.
The Vikings said they had spoken with Moore’s family to offer condolences and support.
“I am devastated by the news of Rondale’s death. While Rondale had been a member of the Vikings for a short time, he was someone we came to know well and care about deeply,” coach Kevin O’Connell said in a statement distributed by the team.
“He was a humble, soft-spoken, and respectful young man who was proud of his Indiana roots. As a player, he was disciplined, dedicated and resilient despite facing adversity multiple times as injuries sidelined him throughout his career. We are all heartbroken by the fact he won’t continue to live out his NFL dream, and we won’t all have a chance to watch him flourish.”
In a statement, the Cardinals said they were “devastated and heartbroken”.
“Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family, friends, teammates, and everyone who loved him and had the privilege of knowing such a special person,” the team said in a social media post.
Moore grew up in New Albany, just across the Indiana border from Louisville, Kentucky, and was a first-team All-American as a freshman at Purdue in 2018.
Drafted in the second round by the Cardinals in 2021, Moore had 1,201 receiving yards and three touchdowns, plus 249 rushing yards and one score over three seasons. He served as their primary returner for kickoffs and punts as a rookie before injuries pushed him away from that role.
“Can’t even begin to fathom or process this,” former Cardinals teammate JJ Watt said on social media. “There’s just no way. Way too soon. Way too special. So much left to give. Rest in peace Rondale.”

Envoy says Trump ‘curious’ why Iran has not ‘capitulated’ under US pressure
Steve Witkoff said Trump can’t understand Tehran’s refusal to yield despite Washington’s military build-up in the region
US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Saturday that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington sent two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to the region to back its warnings.
In a Fox News interview with Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated’ because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t … I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated’, but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of sea power and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”
The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy.
“I met him at the direction of the president,” he said, without providing further details.

AfD leader calls for return to energy imports from Russia

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. Co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party Alice Weidel believes it is necessary to resume energy supplies from Russia.
Germany urgently needs reforms, she noted. "The Alternative for Germany party has a plan for Germany, and we are absolutely clear that Germany must return to an affordable and reliable energy supply to be internationally competitive. This, of course, includes a return to nuclear energy, and we must purchase energy resources, oil and natural gas, where it is cheapest, which is Russia," Weidel said speaking at a party event broadcast on the AfD YouTube channel.
It is for this reason that the AfD party has always advocated for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, she noted. Weidel emphasized the need for a swift end to the conflict in Ukraine. "Where is the strategy here? Why did Western countries, and especially the UK, prevent the Istanbul Moratorium in 2022? This would have been a better peace agreement for [Vladimir] Zelensky than what we have today," she said.
Germany began giving up Russian energy supplies in February 2022. The country is also not receiving gas via Nord Stream as both pipelines were damaged in 2022 as a result of sabotage in the Baltic Sea, one of which had not previously been certified by the German government. In the current situation, the government is relying on the construction of LNG receiving terminals.

Ultimatum
Witkoff's comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days.
Trump said on Thursday that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday said that Trump would not succeed in destroying Iran.
Western countries accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December.

The UAE's national cybersecurity system foiled organized cyberattacks described as having a "terrorist nature" targeting the country’s digital infrastructure and vital sectors, the UAE's Cybersecurity Council confirmed on Saturday.
The attacks were intended to destabilize the country and disrupt essential services, the council said.
According to a post shared by the council on social media, the attacks included attempts to breach networks, deploy ransomware, and conduct organized phishing campaigns targeting national platforms.
Terror groups also used AI as an offensive tool
Attackers also exploited AI technologies to develop complex offensive tools, a significant advancement in terrorist groups' methods and capabilities.
With the start of Ramadan, when many Muslims in the UAE and worldwide make charitable donations, the council urged citizens to adopt "safe practices" online and shared techniques to protect data and prevent fraud.
It has urged the public to report any cyber threats or suspicious attempts through officially approved channels to help safeguard the country’s digital security and ensure the continuity of institutions under all circumstances, according to the report.

At least five bodies of migrants including two women have been washed ashore in َQasr al-Akhyar, a coastal town in the east of Libya's capital Tripoli, a police officer told Reuters on Saturday.
Hassan Al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr Al-Akhyar police station, said that according to people in the area, a child's body washed ashore and because of the waves' height the body returned to the sea, and the coast guard was asked to search for it.
Ghawil said the bodies are all dark-skinned people. The bodies were found on Emhamid Al-Sharif shore in the western part of the town by people who reported to the police station.
Conflict and migration in Libya since 2011
Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean since the fall in 2011 of dictator Muammar Gaddafi to a NATO-backed uprising. Factional conflict has split the country into western and eastern factions since 2014.
Qasr al-Akhyar is a coastal town some 73 kilometers (45 miles) east of Tripoli.

Investor Shani Zanescu launches resilience tech push amid global instability - interview
Unknown

07:43:13 UTC
16:43:13 KST

When Shani Zanescu arrived in Davos two years ago, she found herself less captivated by the swirl of panels and receptions than by the underlying patterns connecting the world’s crises.
Geopolitical shocks, extreme weather, social fragmentation, and economic instability: Each seemed to erupt from a different fault line, yet she saw a common thread.
“I realized I wanted to focus on resilience and technology,” she told The Jerusalem Post. “The world is changing faster than our systems can adapt. So I started mapping the challenges and the meeting points between them.”
That moment became the foundation of Universe Partners, an investment house dedicated to what Zanescu calls “resilience tech,” a field she believes will define the next decade of global innovation to prepare societies to withstand future challenges.
“We know it’s going to happen,” she explains. “So let’s prepare, de‑risk, and be efficient about it.”
The Universe Partners board reflects the scale of that ambition. It includes Philipp Rösler, Germany’s former vice chancellor and minister of economics and technology; Cameron Geiger, who previously led supply chain operations at Walmart; Dr. Laura Segafredo, who headed sustainable product and portfolio research at BlackRock; and Julia Diament, a senior figure in Microsoft’s CTO office and a former lieutenant colonel who led artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in the IDF’s unit 8200.
Additional members come from the World Economic Forum, and last year, Universe Partners announced a collaboration with the Clinton Global Initiative to build and invest in various technologies.
Zanescu herself brings a broad background to the table. Before entering the deep‑tech investment world, she spent a decade in foreign policy and national security roles across Israel, Europe, and the United States.
At Israel’s Defense Ministry, she led collaborations with the Benelux countries, the European Union, and NATO. She later headed the UK‑Israel Foreign Relations Department, overseeing bilateral cooperation in science, technology, and innovation at the British Consulate. Her military service also centred on foreign relations.
In the private sector, Zanescu has invested more than $100 million and managed roughly $400 million in deep‑tech assets through roles including venture partner at Jibe and investment manager at Consensus Business Group, a family office overseeing about $1 billion. She has served as chairwoman and board member for multiple companies and initiatives.
Alongside her professional work, she founded philanthropic organizations such as Israel’s Children’s Fund, which supports children orphaned by the October 7, 2023, attacks, and Plantech, which backs climate‑tech ventures.
Issues of national security
Universe Partners is now raising $20-$30 million in capital for 10-12 early-stage companies working on challenges that Zanescu believes will shape the next era of global stability. These include early prediction of earthquakes, supply‑chain vulnerabilities, tariff disruptions, and energy instability. She is also eager to invest in technologies that counter misinformation.
All of these, she describes, are “a matter of national security.”
Her goal is not only to fund these companies but to help them reach the scale required to make a global impact. “I want to bring these start-ups to the level they can achieve,” she says. “And connect them to the right people.”
Zanescu argues that resilience is better understood in the US and Europe than in Israel, where the term is often interpreted narrowly through a security lens.
Her vision is broader and more systemic. “Resilience tech isn’t about solving one issue,” she explains. “It strengthens many layers of society, and even future issues we haven’t encountered yet.”
She believes that the past five years have been a preview of what’s coming.
“Everything that happened will continue to happen, but at a much faster pace,” she says. “We have predictions, especially around extreme weather. We don’t have the privilege of taking our time. We know what’s coming, so let’s not be surprised.”
Zanescu also sees an opportunity to expand Israel’s innovation ecosystem outward, particularly toward Abraham Accords countries facing acute challenges in energy and food security.
Other venture capital firms, she notes, are beginning to acknowledge that the only constant is change. But she believes resilience tech will soon become a category of its own, one that governments, corporations, and investors will increasingly prioritize.
Zanescu’s message is ultimately pragmatic rather than alarmist. “Instead of being afraid of change, let’s handle it,” she says. “Let’s make sure society can withstand what’s coming.”

FIFA president Infantino joins Trump at Board of Peace for Gaza sports rebuild

FIFA president Gianni Infantino's presence at the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace this week, alongside United States President Donald Trump and other heads of state, does not violate any Olympic Charter rules on political neutrality, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
The boss of global soccer's governing body, who is also an IOC member, took part in Thursday's meeting of The Board of Peace, which is focusing on reconstruction work in Gaza and aims to rebuild the territory once Hamas disarms.
"The IOC has been in contact with FIFA," an IOC spokesperson said. "We understand that FIFA is supporting, through football, a comprehensive sport recovery investment program in Gaza, by providing sporting infrastructure, education and elite development proposals."
"This is entirely in keeping with the role of an International sport federation. The IOC, through Olympic Solidarity, which is our development vehicle, has been and continues to support sport development in the region," the spokesperson said.
The Olympic Charter states that members must always act independently of commercial and political interests. They also cannot accept "from governments, organizations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote," the Charter says.
IOC confirms Infantino’s participation in Trump meeting
Trump's Board of Peace has been controversial. It includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives, and Trump's suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the UN's role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
Infantino appeared on stage with several heads of state, sported a red hat with 'USA' on the front and the numbers 45-47, for the two non-consecutive presidencies of Trump.
Infantino also displayed the FIFA collaboration agreement with The Board of Peace, which includes building 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy and a new 20,000-seat national stadium.
Trump has met Infantino several times, with the United States set to co-host this summer's soccer World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.
The US President was also awarded FIFA's inaugural peace prize in December for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world's biggest hotspots, the soccer body said at the time.

India-Israel tech synergy will define the next decade of defense strategy - opinion

On February 1, 2026, New Delhi formally codified a fundamental shift in its security paradigm: With the unveiling of the Union Budget for fiscal year (FY) 2026-27, the Indian Ministry of Defense received a historic allocation of approximately $93.5 billion (₹7.85 lakh crore). This 15.2% increase is not merely an inflationary adjustment but also serves as the strategic financial roadmap for the post-Operation Sindoor era – reflecting an India that has moved from strategic ambiguity to assertive clarity.
For Israel’s defense establishment and the broader Western alliance, this budget is a seminal document. Against the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Israel in late February, this allocation signals the final transition from a traditional supplier-customer model to a deep industrial partnership.
The India that Modi represents in 2026 is no longer a security consumer; it is a security provider seeking to shape the regional environment through technological self-reliance.
The strategic legacy of Operation Sindoor
The budget must be viewed through the lens of Operation Sindoor (May 2025), which validated India’s shift toward "precision statecraft." The operation demonstrated that integrated intelligence, armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and AI-driven intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) could impose costs on adversaries while remaining below the threshold of full-scale nuclear escalation.
The FY27 budget represents the "Sindoor dividend," with a 21.8% surge in capital expenditure, totaling over $26.1 billion (₹2.19 lakh crore). This funding is now also strategically funneled into hi-tech "force multipliers" rather than traditional heavy platforms alone.
A critical 30% increase in the "other equipment" – approximately $9.8 billion (₹82,217 crore) – is specifically directed at artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous ISR systems, and network-centric warfare. India is no longer purchasing hardware in isolation; it is investing in the "digital brain" of the force to ensure operational fusion between its services.
Structural imbalance: A shared Indo-Israeli challenge
A granular analysis of the budget reveals a structural imbalance mirroring the Israeli defense dilemma. Both nations grapple with manpower-heavy models that constrain technological maneuverability. The 2026 budget indicates that, despite the modernization push, fixed costs remain a significant burden.
There are fixed budgetary commitments as India dedicates approximately $20.4 billion (₹1.71 lakh crore) to pensions (21.84% of the budget) and $24.7 billion to pay and allowances (26.40%). Combined, nearly half of the defense outlay is consumed by personnel costs, a reality that parallels the Israeli challenge of legacy budgetary pensions and high personnel maintenance.
AI is the strategic escape velocity, and in order to overcome this fiscal rigidity, India is betting on extreme efficiency. AI serves as a strategic solution, enabling "more security with less manpower." This resonates deeply with the IDF’s "small and smart" doctrine. By automating ISR, logistics, and border management, India aims to maximize its "teeth-to-tail" (combat personnel to support personnel) ratio.
There are also parallel reform trajectories. India’s Agnipath scheme (reforming recruitment for a tech-savvy force) and the SPARSH project (digital pension delivery) are direct responses to this structural weight. These efforts mirror Israeli initiatives to modernize military HR and reduce the pension drag on modernization funds.
The AI revolution and the Israeli advantage
The FY27 budget makes it clear that the Indian market for conventional, off-the-shelf platforms is shrinking while the market for intelligence-on-board (integrating AI, edge computing, and smart systems for autonomous decision-making) is exploding. India's counter-drone architecture, which successfully destroyed hundreds of hostile drones during Sindoor, is now the baseline requirement.
This is where the Israeli sector has a unique advantage. Israeli defense firms are not just equipment vendors; they are providers of battle-proven algorithms.
As India seeks to integrate AI across its three services, from underwater domain awareness to high-altitude surveillance, the Israeli "combat-proven AI" has become the preferred currency.
The upcoming visit of PM Modi is expected to focus on creating joint AI centers of excellence, where Israeli software is embedded into Indian-manufactured hardware, satisfying both India’s technical needs and its political mandate for self-reliance.
The Atmanirbhar Bharat policy framework: Redefining the partnership
The reservation of 75% of the capital acquisition fund, approximately $16.5 billion (₹1.39 lakh crore) for the domestic industry, is a mandatory requirement for future engagement. Israeli firms must move from exporting to co-production. The budget provides several specific entry points. Among them are MRO and sustainment hubs (the exemption of customs duties on raw materials for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) is a direct invitation for Israel to establish regional service hubs in India. This ensures India's strategic autonomy while maintaining an Israeli technological presence.
Private sector synergy is also one of the points; partnering with Indian giants, such as Tata, L&T, and Bharat Forge, is no longer optional. As the private sector’s share in defense production hits record levels, Israeli firms must embed their sensors, radars, and AI suites within owned-by-India platforms.
There is also the drone ecosystem, which follows the performance of autonomous systems in recent regional conflicts. India is accelerating its indigenous counter-drone and swarm-drone programs. The missing piece of the Indian puzzle is Israeli expertise in electronic warfare and AI-driven target tracking.
The road to Jerusalem
Modi’s visit, slated for late February, will be the moment when India’s fiscal planning meets its diplomatic execution.
The FY27 budget has set the stage: India is willing to spend nearly $94 billion, but it demands technology that is not only-combat proven but also "Made in India."
The synergy between Israeli AI expertise and India’s industrial scale is the only viable path for the next decade of their strategic partnership.
For the Israeli defense community, the message is clear: The opportunity is vast, but the entry price is a willingness to share technology and build local capacity. Those who align with India's goal of sovereign crisis management today will shape tomorrow’s hard-power equation.

MOSCOW, 22 February (BelTA) - A new “Belarusian Village” opened in St. Petersburg, Russia on 20 February, BelTA learned from the press service of the Belarusian Embassy in Russia.
“Another 'Belarusian Village' has opened in the very heart of St. Petersburg - in the Gallery shopping and entertainment center on Ligovsky Prospekt. Ahead of the spring holidays, Belarusian goods became even closer and more accessible to residents and guests of the northern capital of Russia,” the diplomatic mission noted.
The Belarusian Village project was launched last year on the initiative of the Minsk Dairy Plant No. 1 trading house and was supported by the Belarusian government, the Belarusian Embassy in Russia and Russian retailers. The concept of the Belarusian Village suggests bringing various Belarusian producers from food products to light industry goods in one space.
The project will be scaled up, Irina Novikova, director of the Minsk Dairy Plant No. 1 trading house told BelTA earlier. In Moscow, cooperation with the Auchan hypermarket chain will continue, with new “Belarusian Villages” opening in three of their stores by April. In addition, negotiations are underway to create such retail spots in Yekaterinburg, Severodvinsk, and Ulan-Ude where “Belarusian Villages” may be set up by the end of this year. The "Belarusian Village" brand has become very popular and Irina Novikova did not rule out future work with Russian partners in the regions under a franchise model.

Stockpiling food, sealing windows: Iranians brace for possible war

Nearly eight months after Israel and the United States carried out strikes in Iran last summer, residents of Tehran say they are again bracing for the possibility of a broader conflict as the United States expands its military presence in the Middle East.
The recent deployment of additional U.S. forces, including aircraft carriers in the region, has fueled anxiety in the Iranian capital, where memories remain fresh of the 12-day conflict in June that ended in a fragile ceasefire.
“I sleep badly at night, even with medication,” said Hamid, a retiree in Tehran, speaking to Agence France-Presse. Others described similar fears as speculation grows that another round of fighting could erupt in the coming days.
On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was “considering” a strike against Iran, prompting many in the Islamic Republic to recall the night of June 12-13, when Israel launched a surprise attack as Tehran was preparing for renewed nuclear negotiations with Washington.
“I think a war between Iran, the U.S. and Israel is inevitable,” said Mina Ahmadvand, an information technology worker in Tehran. “Everything changes by the hour.”
Haniyeh, a 31-year-old jeweler, said she has struggled with anxiety since the previous round of fighting.
“I can’t sleep at night anymore. I have nightmares where I am being chased and I die,” she said. “I go to bed late, wake up late and I am depressed.”
A recent nighttime thunderstorm in Tehran and fireworks marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution were enough to alarm some residents, who initially feared fighting had resumed.
Iran has warned that in the event of an attack, Israel would be considered a legitimate target, along with U.S. bases in the Middle East.
Concerns have also been heightened by domestic unrest. Trump has cited a figure of more than 30,000 protesters killed during demonstrations in January, a claim that differs from other estimates. Human rights groups have accused Iranian security forces of deliberately targeting protesters, while Iranian authorities have said many of those killed were security personnel or bystanders slain by what they describe as terrorists backed by Israel and the United States.
“Since the protests, my life has been on pause,” Haniyeh said. “Now with this situation, we are waiting to see what happens. I think war will break out within 10 days.”
Despite the tense atmosphere, daily life in Tehran — a metropolis of about 10 million people — has continued largely as usual. Traffic congestion remains heavy and pedestrians weave through crowded streets lined with motorcycles carrying goods.
Behind the outward routine, however, some residents are taking precautions.
“I bought about 10 cans of food, including tuna and beans, as well as cookies, bottled water and spare batteries,” Ahmadvand said. “I don’t wish for war, but we must not take the situation lightly.”
She said she had stocked enough supplies for a week and sealed her windows in preparation for a possible emergency.
“I am applying the lessons I learned from the 12-day war,” she said.

The West: From sexual slavery to Epstein Island
Unknown

16:35:18 KST

Since the 15th century, when the followers of liberalism in Europe set out to discover new areas in the world and the colonial period was formed, along with the plunder of Africa's natural resources, the slave trade was also formed.
During this period, thousands of Africans were "hunted" and sold in European and American markets, and the economies of countries such as England, France, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, and then the United States, flourished from this trade. During this period, slaves did not only become a means of production, but were also sexually abused by Westerners, and sexual abuse, especially against children and adolescents, was added to the suffering of slaves.
James Walwin, a historian and professor at New York University, has presented a vivid picture of sexual slavery during the colonial period in his research and in his book "Black Ivory" says: "Any type of sexual operation with female slaves was permitted, and the first sexual intercourse of white boys who reached puberty was usually with black women who had raised them or even breastfed them. Thus, a generation of congenital slaves emerged; Humans who had white fathers and worked as slaves in the homes of their paternal brothers and relatives. For a long time, Europeans prevented the formation of a family center in black society because they thought that they lacked the instinct to form a family; creatures lower than animals! Many years passed before slaves were finally allowed to have a family life."
Sexual abuse of slaves, which gradually became known as sexual slavery, transformed the inhabitants of colonial countries, especially in Africa, into uneven societies lacking a balanced demographic and cultural structure, and destroyed their political and social structures. Men, especially young men, were generally enslaved and separated from their families, and the female population was disproportionately dominated by the male population and, worse, exposed to the pleasures of their Western European masters. Colonialism in Africa added new concepts such as the sex industry and "slave prostitution" to the Western vocabulary and extended it to other parts of the world, and thus a new type of slavery was formed that held millions of women in captivity and spread prostitution throughout the world.
In 1991, at a conference of the Southeast Asian Women's Organization in Malaysia, it was said that from 1975 to 1991, that is, in a period of 16 years, at least 30 million women were sold into brothels worldwide. Ms. Vasilia Tamzali, head of UNESCO's Women's Division, said at the conference: "The sex industry is a huge market with its own driving forces. These global slavery networks are run by powerful Western mafia gangs that control the sex market, from Japan to the United States." (Time Magazine, June 1993)
In the 21st century, the events of Epstein Island, which became known as a hideout for the trafficking of young women and underage girls for sexual slavery and child abuse, and sexual harassment, were another nail in the coffin of liberal democracy after the tragedies of the colonial era. Jeffrey Edward Epstein, an American financier, child molester, and human trafficker, committed suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York in 2019. He bought the island of "Little St. James" in 1998 and turned it into a place of pleasure for senior officials of Western countries, especially the United States and Britain. On this island, a modern system was created to lure and attract underage girls who were transported to the island on private planes with the promise of work and earning money. They, along with a number of children, were sexually abused and molested by Epstein's high-ranking guests. To prosper in his business, Epstein asked his victims to lure other girls and bring them to the island in exchange for money.
He had relationships with influential figures in politics, economics, and the media in the United States, Europe, and Israel, and with their support, he was not afraid of the consequences of his crimes.
After Epstein died in prison in 2019, the FBI raided the island and seized hundreds of gigabytes of files and images. Subsequent targeted leaks revealed a much larger and more dangerous network than previously thought. These leaks revealed that guests on the island included prominent Western figures.
The Epstein Island scandals, which are beyond description, have shown how liberal systems that present themselves as the cultural axis of the world and supporters of human rights, women and children, nurture networks of sexual abuse in their hearts with the participation of influential political and economic figures.
Today, it is the duty of the UN Human Rights Council and other international institutions to break their silence and take a firm stand against the transnational dimensions of this tragedy. Institutions such as UNICEF, which is responsible for protecting children's rights, and the international police (Interpol) must carry out their duties as quickly as possible. ofcourse the continued silence of governmental and non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and similar institutions will show their participation in the tragedies of Epstein Island.

Pakistan launches airstrikes on Afghanistan killing and wounding dozens
Taliban vows to give ‘measured response’ after cross-border firing
- Bookmark

Pakistan has carried out airstrikes on what it described as militant hideouts inside Afghanistan, saying it was a response to cross-border attacks that have killed members of its security forces and civilians.
Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said the strikes hit a religious school and several residential homes, killing and wounding dozens of civilians.
The Taliban-run defence ministry described the action as a “blatant violation of national sovereignty” and said an “appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time”.
They added that they considered the act a “a clear breach of international law, the principles of good neighbourliness, and Islamic values”.
Pakistan said it had targeted hideouts belonging to the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed militant network responsible for a surge in attacks in Pakistan’s north-west. The military described the operation as “intelligence-based” and said it was aimed at camps used to plan and launch assaults across the border.
The strikes followed a suicide vehicle bombing in Bajaur district on Tuesday that killed 11 Pakistani security personnel and a child, an attack claimed by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
A statement from Pakistan's ministry of information and broadcasting said the country had “conclusive evidence” that militants behind the recent attacks were operating under the direction of “Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
It said the operation targeted seven militant camps and that the Taliban regime “failed to undertake any substantive action” despite Pakistan’s urging.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of its citizens was its priority.
Issuing a strong condemnation of the strikes, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid wrote in a post on X: “Pakistani special military circles have once again trespassed into Afghan territory.”
He said dozens of “civilian compatriots” were injured and killed, including women and children, in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
“Pakistani generals compensate for their country's security weaknesses through such crimes,” he wrote.
Since the Taliban forcibly seized control of Kabul in August 2021, Pakistan has repeatedly accused it of failing to curb TTP fighters who use Afghan territory as a base to organise and launch attacks. Kabul has consistently denied allowing any group to use its soil to threaten other countries.
Hours before the strikes, a suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in Pakistan's northwest, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel.
Pakistan's military warned after Saturday’s attack that it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”.
Relations between the two neighbours have been strained since October, when clashes along the border left dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants dead. The escalation came after explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan.
Although a ceasefire brokered by Qatar has largely held, negotiations held in Istanbul in November 2025 failed to produce a formal settlement, leaving ties fragile and tensions unresolved.

Our women in Syria should have support they deserve

Our women in Syria should have support they deserve
I applaud the PM’s view that if they make the bed they should lie in it (“Road to Damascus”, February 21). It completes his transition from left-wing table thumper to national leader. It has a much wider application, though. Smokers with lung cancer, or drinkers with liver disease? No Medicare for you. Speeding and hit a tree? Get yourself to the nearest private hospital. Finally, tell the abusive boss to stick it? No JobSeeker payments for you. Go to a conflict zone and get injured or imprisoned? Suck eggs, sister. Imagine the savings: money that could be better used. David Neilson, Uralla
As a private citizen, Anthony Albanese is entitled to feel “contempt” for the Australians languishing in an increasingly dangerous Syrian camp. But having sworn an oath to “serve the Commonwealth of Australia, her land and people”, he does not have the right to deny procedural fairness and access to the rule of law to these Aussies. No amount of political posturing and tough-speak can cloud his responsibility. Mark Paskal, Austinmer
Our “nothing but contempt” PM, Angus Taylor and Pauline Hanson have finally achieved “cohesion” in beating down on the Australian women and children stuck in Syria. But Australia has, of course, form in this: only five years ago, during COVID-19, we threatened our own citizens in India with imprisonment and hefty fines if they dared to come home to Australia. What a timid and fearful country Australia has become. With the current “leadership”, there is not much hope for improvement. Dierk Mohr, South Turramurra
I fear our PM, Anthony Albanese, is disappointing many of those who put faith in him and his government. With a thumping majority, and the opportunity to prove that his government values kindness and decency, he has stigmatised these unfortunate women and blameless children. Instead of offering them friendly asylum, he has followed the hard right in condemning them. It seems obvious that he has done this in order not to be out of step with the noisy popularist right, who he fears might take some votes away from Labor. The Australian electorate is better than that. Rather than join in the baying throng, he should be endorsing principles contained in a progressive Labor agenda. You’ve failed us, PM. Shame on you. Derrick Mason, Boorowa
Is Australia’s public security so frail that it cannot manage the assessment and support of 11 Australian women and 23 Australian children wishing to return to the country whose passports they hold? Does the prime minister’s expressed contempt for these women extend to the titans of the gambling industry who wreak such destruction on the lives of thousands of Australians and who access the halls of Parliament House with easy confidence? Does this contempt fit with his previously avowed view that kindness is not weakness? Or does it suggest a scurrying to the right, to shore up perceived voter threat? This has been a bleak episode; the moral compass crushed under the marching heel of political expediency. Jon Fogarty, North Avoca
My mother used to say, “You learn from your mistakes.” Paree Hartley, North Sydney
So, when Anthony Albanese says that the girls who went to Syria made their own bed and should therefore lie in it, isn’t he basically saying that women who end up in violent relationships should not try and leave those relationships because they made a foolish choice in going into the relationship? I notice that Tony Burke has expressed similar uncaring, judgmental views about this group of teenage girls who were groomed or coerced into travelling to Syria. And here I was, thinking that this was going to be a nicer, more compassionate government than the other lot. How wrong I was. Catherine Rossiter, Fadden (ACT)
The current leaders of the Labor, Liberal and National parties all profess to hold strong Christian values and morals. Regarding the dire circumstances of the ISIS brides and their children, a simple question: what would Jesus do?Paul Soares, Bardwell Valley
Gutted by rejection
Much of the community is gutted by the UNESCO rejection of the Parramatta Female Factory for World Heritage (“UN rejects Parramatta heritage bid for precinct”, February 21). This is after 15 years of advocating for it with support by amazing Australians including Jack and Judy Mundey and Tom and Meg Keneally, 20,000-plus petitions from all over Australia and internationally, as well as significant state and government support. The reason, we believe, is that its assessment focus was on the institutional care of the submission, not the thousands of women who went through it, or the fights for rights by hundreds of women against military, police and the system, including the first women’s workers action. We are pleading that the state and federal government continue the good work and submit an extension of the 11 world heritage sites to 12, as was done for the Tasmanian wilderness; make it a museum with management by museum experts with appropriate funding. The Parramatta Female Factory Friends have fought for this place. We submitted a successful National Heritage Listing because we believed it worthy, just as we believe in the world heritage value. Gay Hendriksen, president, Parramatta Female Factory Friends
Off to the Tower
There are suggestions that the scandal surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor could be a catalyst for revisiting the question of changing our head of state (“A duke reduced: arrest, prints, cell”, February 21). However, as long as the king of a constitutional monarchy prioritises national duty over family loyalty and reputation, insisting that the “law must take its course” while the president of a democratic republic blatantly flouts justice and disregards all personal responsibility, I reckon that any increase in support for an Australian republic would now be unlikely. Col Burns, Lugarno
Surely there is a traditional and practical solution to the problems raised by the behaviour of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor: have His Majesty the King lock him in the Tower, as has happened with previous royal transgressors. Not only will it give those splendidly uniformed Tower jailers a real purpose in life, it should also vastly increase tourism numbers and easily pay for any costs involved. Irving Warren, Riverview
While it is embarrassing in the short term, I believe that Andrew’s arrest demonstrates the strength, importance and ongoing value of the monarchy. Not a single president, elected politician, government official, business magnate, charity advocate or star celebrity has been arrested for their entanglements with Jeffrey Epstein – yet royalty has been prepared to step ahead before all of them to see justice done. Supposedly “progressive” institutions have been put to shame by the monarchy’s meaningful gesture. Robert Frazer, Campbelltown
If Andrew does get sentenced to jail at his brother’s pleasure, we can only hope he isn’t sent to the colonies to serve out his time.Jenny Coote, Woonona
I have great respect for King Charles. One gets the sense that he is a decent human being: a good King. Prince William seems to be cut from similar cloth. So we condemn the behaviour of Mountbatten-Windsor and we keep monarchy. But suppose Andrew had been the firstborn? I imagine that if nothing else we’d regret not having become are public. Gerianne Rudd, Toowong (Qld)
I wonder if he’s sweating now? Patrick McGrath, Potts Point
Put endangered fauna before cats
Every cat owner should be required to read Antone Martinho-Truswell’s article (“Don’t bell the nation’s cats. Make it illegal to own one”, February 21), which is a common-sense blueprint for state and federal governments. Local councils need suitable laws to eliminate cats outside owners’ properties. The killing of 3 billion of our native animals by cats each year cannot rationally be acceptable. Since 1788, immigrants to this country have failed to protect our environment. As custodians, we have a duty to leave this country in a better condition then we found it, for our future generations. Is it time to consider breeding our endangered fauna for pets? Regardless, it is time to protect what fauna we have left by stopping the import and breeding of cats, and thus for our politicians to use their common sense to control and eradicate existing cats found in the public domain. Brian McDonald, Willoughby
Oh, Antone! Think of those poor lonely people whose pet cat gives them a reason to live. I agree, though, that pet cats should definitely be indoor pets and neutered. Where I live, huge feral cats roam the bush and there are thousands of rabbits running around unchecked. They are frequently seen grazing the nature strips and don’t even bother to move when you drive by. This is 20 minutes from the CBD. Baits were put down a while ago to eradicate the foxes, which has helped the rabbits to proliferate. It’s not unusual to see a group of bush turkeys marching down the street. At least the foxes kept the cat, rabbit and bush turkey numbers down. Judith Rostron, Killarney Heights
Antone Martinho-Truswell describes a very alarming picture of feral and domestic cats decimating, if not eliminating, Australia’s native fauna. It’s an emotional, misleading article. Feral cats are referred to with domestic cats. The estimated population of feral cats is 6.3 million, with another 700,000 living in urban areas. Domestic cats number about 5 million to 6 million. Over 90 per cent are neutered. According to Antone, pet cats kill almost 200 animals per cat, per year. What are these animals killed by domestic cats? Because many of the native species under threat live in the regions and the national parks near the cities, we don’t see them in city streets and parks. In fact, in urban areas, cats kill mostly mice and rats, as well as skinks and little lizards.
What we don’t have are bilbies, numbats, bandicoots or quolls – the native species most at threat by feral cats. So before we ban domestic cats, perhaps we could address the problem of feral cats roaming the countryside and killing native animals. Rodney Crute, Hunters Hill
Good luck with that, Antone. Alicia Dawson, Balmain
Another environmental advantage of banning cats would be reduced resource use and less waste through the elimination of their single use plastic, single serve dinners and associated plastic paraphernalia. Karen Joynes, Bermagui
I have to ask; “Why pick on cats?” There are many other sources of threat to native wildlife. For instance, dogs. The biggest threat to our wildlife is land clearing, which destroys habitat. What about the effect on habitat of farm animals? Should we ban cars, which are responsible for many deaths of native animals? Domestic cat ownership provides many benefits to families and individuals, so let’s not foster a pathological hatred of them. Robin Douglas, Cherrybrook
In response to the call to outlaw cat ownership, please note that the inner west, at least, is indeed alive with roaming mammals, but unfortunately, those mammals are rats. The rats are now largely resistant to poison and are no longer taking bait. Cats are an effective line of defence against the rats and should most certainly not be banned until there is an alternative and equally effective method for eradicating rats. Patricia Loughlan, Glebe
Yes, cats need to be contained indoors or in secure areas where they cannot roam. That could be a requirement to owning a cat. Not hard to do, but perhaps harder to enforce. Stray or wandering cats could be rounded up and, if not possible to identify and returned to the legal registered owner, be euthanised. Legal owners who do not contain their cats need to be fined. Yes, I am a cat lover and own one cat, who has never been outside. My cat is affectionate and part of our family. She brings joy and happiness into our home. I think a less emotional approach needs to be taken to resolve this issue. Stephen Wilton, Ettalong Beach
Fear of violence
I understand the trauma of break-in and burglary in the Kempsey region (“The towns where kids wear balaclavas and carry machetes”, February 21). Recently, while working at the Aboriginal medical service in Kempsey, and staying in Crescent Head, I had a late-night break-in. My bag, with cash, keys, phone, and two cars were stolen – video surveillance showed it was four balaclava-covered youths. I was fortunate, as tracking software enabled police to locate my phone and one of the cars. I was only significantly traumatised when I learnt there were golf clubs in the cars, stolen elsewhere, that could have been used if my husband or I had woken, as the burglary occurred in the next room. The burglary was not the traumatic fear – it was the fear of violence. These young people have often suffered repeated episodes of violence in their lives. This is what needs to be addressed. Where are the old police boys clubs where young men are occupied and taught life skills and other ways of dealing with emotions and boredom? Where are the older men leading by good example? Katriona Herborn, Blackheath
Australia-wide request
A wonderful letter about Lakemba (Letters, February 21). Whether we visit Lakemba or not, surely your correspondent’s request not to bring anger and racism with you should apply Australia wide. Lynne Poleson, Kingsford

A Personal Tribute to a Friend, Courageous Opponent of Soviet Political Abuses of Psychiatry

I had the privilege of knowing Semon Gluzman, who died this week. I do not claim to have known him well. But, all the same, there was an indirect and direct connection.
I’d like to recall this as part of my tribute to this courageous individual, who initially became a symbol of independent thought and ethical professionalism and paid a price for it as a Soviet political prisoner, but who also, as a freethinker, subsequently contributed to the development of the notion of a Ukrainian political nation.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
My first memories of Gluzman are from the mid-1970s. At the time, I was both a postgraduate at the London School of Economics and Political Science and already involved with those in London who were campaigning for the release of Soviet political prisoners, and especially the victims of the Soviet abuse of psychiatry for political purposes.
Gluzman, as a young psychiatrist, made his name by courageously opposing punitive psychiatry as applied by the Soviet authorities against dissenters. One of them was the Ukrainian former Soviet general, Petro Hryhorenko, who had turned against the system. Gluzman dared to refuse to recognize that this “patient” was indeed insane and made his findings public.
Born in Kyiv, he served as a psychiatrist in the notorious Dnipropetrovsk Special Psychiatric Hospital, where numerous political dissidents were held. He was probably the first Soviet psychiatrist to break ranks and expose the truth about what was happening.
Hundreds Rally in Paris to Support Ukraine After Four Years of War
He was arrested in May 1972 and subsequently sentenced to seven years in a strict-regime labor camp and three years in Siberian exile for “anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.” While imprisoned, he continued his defiance, notably co-authoring “A Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents” with Vladimir Bukovsky between 1973 and 1974
Following his release from exile in 1982, Gluzman remained in Ukraine, continuing his fight for human rights despite ongoing harassment. With the fall of the Soviet Union, he became a pivotal figure in reforming Ukrainian psychiatry. In 1991, he founded the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association, serving as its president and working to integrate Ukrainian psychiatry into the international professional community and establish ethical standards.
I recall taking part in large public meetings in London, especially in Trafalgar Square, when a host of well-known public figures called for the release of Soviet prisoners of conscience. They included many Ukrainians, such as the mathematician Leonid Pliushch and physician Mykola Plakhotniuk. And Gluzman’s name figured prominently.
At that time. I was not even aware as a young student that Gluzman was from Kyiv. He was depicted simply as a brave “Russian” psychiatrist who had opposed the imprisonment of dissenters in Soviet psychiatric hospitals.
It was only later that I discovered that, after he had been arrested and detained in Kyiv, not Moscow or any other large Russian city, for his courageous position in refusing to do what the Soviet authorities demanded of him, that as a Soviet Ukrainian Jew, he had undergone a transformation in his view of things.
Time as a political prisoner
While awaiting trial in a Kyiv KGB cell, he met the prominent Ukrainian poet and defender of Ukraine’s national rights, Vasyl Stus.
I was subsequently impressed to learn how the two diverse personalities with different priorities but united by their defense of human rights had interacted in the prison cell. They bonded and opened up to one another.
The Russian-speaking psychiatrist Gluzman gave Stus tips on how to act before his KGB interrogators. For his part, Stus explained to his temporary cellmate what Ukrainian patriots were struggling for, interested him in learning basic Ukrainian, and even shared some of his poems with him
So, Gluzman, preoccupied with opposing political abuses of psychiatry, was won over to the Ukrainian cause that hitherto he had not been particularly interested in.
Subsequently, in the labor camps in which he served his sentence, Gluzman felt at home with Ukrainian political prisoners. Including those national freedom fighters from the late 1940s and early 1950s that the Soviets had branded as Nazis.
After completing his sentence and Ukraine becoming independent, Gluzman returned to his psychiatric profession, eventually becoming the head of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association, which he founded.
He maintained a very open and balanced perspective. As a former “Soviet” Jew, after his experience in the Soviet labor camps and his meetings with Ukraine’s leading national rights defenders, he developed his own views on what an independent Ukraine should be.
A former dissident and political prisoner, Gluzman did not try to capitalize on this politically. He worked and advanced within his profession and, from time to time, shared his thoughts about where Ukraine was heading.
We know that he supported the Maidan protests, or rather the Revolution of Dignity, which occurred at the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014.
But it is clear that he became very disillusioned with what followed under President Petro Poroshenko. He became increasingly critical of what he saw as the failure to uphold the principles of the Revolution of Dignity.
He also questioned, and then opposed, the approach to the reform of the country’s health care system launched under Poroshenko.
I met Gluzman several times, the last just before Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine. It was on a terrace on Khreshchatyk Street close to the Maidan.
We had an intense discussion about the way Ukraine was heading. He was not happy with what he was seeing. This was towards the end of the Poroshenko era, but before Zelensky emerged on the political scene and before he was elected president of the country.
Corruption, broken promises, cheap patriotic populism, and incompetence in managing reforms, especially in the health sphere—these were among issues he raised.
But he was also concerned that the project to build a new, modern, inclusive Ukraine was faltering because of what he saw as the wrong, populist, and inherently divisive, motivations from the top.
I don’t know what he felt and believed subsequently, as Zelensky replaced Poroshenko, and Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine.
Suffice to say, he remained on the fringes and did not seek the limelight for himself.
So, in this short tribute, I want to pay my respects to a courageous psychiatrist who risked, or rather invited, imprisonment for opposing the barbaric Soviet ways of treating dissenters.
But also as a figure who embodied the movement in Ukraine towards genuine democracy and the crystallization of an authentic political nation.
Gluzman maintained his dignity and principles throughout and had the guts to express his views on the state of affairs, whether during Soviet despotism or the complex period of independent democratic statehood that followed.
We are fortunate that he was with us and did what he did. He will not be forgotten.

US envoy Steve Witkoff says Trump questioning why Iran has not ‘capitulated’
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Feb 21 that President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The United States and Iran this week resumed Oman-mediated talks in Geneva aimed at averting the possibility of military action, after Washington dispatched two aircraft carriers
In a Fox News interview with Mr Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara, Mr Witkoff said the president was “curious” about Iran’s position after he had warned them of severe consequences in the event they failed to strike a deal.
“I don’t want to use the word ‘frustrated,’ because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he’s curious as to why they haven’t... I don’t want to use the word ‘capitulated,’ but why they haven’t capitulated,” he said.
“Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven’t they come to us and said, ‘We profess we don’t want a weapon, so here’s what we’re prepared to do’? And yet it’s sort of hard to get them to that place.”
The US envoy also confirmed in the interview that he had met with Mr Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy.
“I met him at the direction of the president,” he said, without providing further details.
US-based Mr Pahlavi last week told a crowd in Munich that he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future” after Mr Trump said regime change would be best
Mr Witkoff’s comments come after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days.
Mr Trump said on Feb 19 that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear programme.
As talks between the two nations continued in Geneva, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Feb 17 said that Mr Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic.
Western countries accuse the Islamic Republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy, which played a role in sparking anti-government protests in December. AFP

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he is going to dispatch a hospital ship to Greenland, the Arctic island Trump has said he wants to acquire.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Trump said in a post on social media alongside an illustration of the U.S. hospital ship the Mercy.
Trump appointed Landry as his special envoy to Greenland just before Christmas, as the U.S. president continued his push for control of the self-ruling Danish territory, which he has said is vital for American national security.

New peace talks on ending Ukraine war will take place within three weeks – Witkoff
U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said this in an interview with Fox News, Ukrinform reports.
"We're hopeful, Jared [Kushner] and I, that we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky and President Putin. It might end up being a trilateral at some point with President [Donald Trump]. We'll have to see," he said.
According to Witkoff, Trump does not want to attend a meeting unless he feels that he can achieve the best result.
Witkoff also expressed hope that the world could hear "good news" on this issue in the coming weeks.
Zelensky earlier said that the next round of peace talks should take place in Geneva within ten days.
On February 18, talks in a trilateral format involving representatives of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia concluded in Geneva.

Four Years of Heroic Resistance: Ukraine Will Not Be Broken

Four years ago this week, on Feb. 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion, expecting Kyiv to fall within days and sovereign Ukraine to disappear within weeks.
He had begun his military aggression against Ukraine back in 2014 when his unidentified “green men” seized Crimea and plunged the Donbas into a bloodbath.

He was confident Russia’s might and the West’s hesitation. would allow him to get away with his criminal goals.
He was wrong.
Ukraine still stands. Its flag flies over Kyiv. Its military fights on. Its people endure, remaining defiant and hopeful.
The cost has been brutal. Tens of thousands of soldiers are dead. Thousands of civilians killed. Millions displaced. Cities reduced to rubble. Some 18 percent of Ukraine’s territory occupied by the Russian invaders.
Yet Ukraine has not broken.
Whatever his domestic shortcomings, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has provided the necessary wartime leadership and become a Churchillian figure on the international scene.
Ukraine’s armed forces have held the line against a larger enemy. Citizens have kept the country running through blackouts and air raids. Western military aid and financial support have been crucial.
But US President Donald Trump’s approach has created grave uncertainty about his country’s commitment. Europe has stepped up instead. Britain, France, Germany, Poland, the Nordics, the Baltics, and Canada – a Coalition of the Willing – are filling the void.
UK Should Send Non-Combat Troops to Ukraine ‘Now’ – Boris Johnson
Russia has paid a staggering price. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed or wounded. Its economy buckling under war costs and sanctions. Internationally disgraced and isolated, Moscow depends on China, North Korea, and Iran for survival.
Western support has been vital, but it hasn’t reached decisive levels. Ukraine needs more – not just to survive, but to force Russia to the table on terms that respect sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Talk of peace negotiations is hollow without real pressure. Putin won’t negotiate in good faith. He respects only force. Appeasement has never worked with Moscow, and it won’t work now. Every delay, every half-measure, and every attempt to accommodate the Kremlin only emboldens further aggression.
Remember, this is not a neighborhood dispute. This is a genocidal war against Ukraine and a direct threat to Europe and the free world. If aggression succeeds here, autocrats worldwide will take note.
The West must act. Expand sanctions. Increase military aid. Isolate Moscow completely. Guarantee Ukraine’s future in a democratic Europe with a clear path to EU and NATO membership. Pressure Russia to retreat – not merely hope it will.
This is a struggle between authoritarianism and freedom, old-style imperialism and national self-determination.
Four years ago, Putin sought to erase Ukraine. Instead, he forged a nation more united than ever. That is his failure – and Ukraine’s strength.
Putin has also woken Europe up to realities, and even as the US steps back and its leadership appeases the Kremlin, Ukraine has been reassured that it will not be abandoned and left to fend for itself.
There is no more time to waste!

Bodies of 9 backcountry skiers recovered in California
Victims include 6 close friends, 3 professional guides as authorities launch investigations into deadly avalanche in Lake Tahoe,
ISTANBUL
The bodies of nine backcountry skiers killed earlier this week were recovered Saturday after an avalanche struck the California side of Lake Tahoe, according to officials.
Authorities said the group was on a day-trip skiing expedition Tuesday when the avalanche struck.
Six of those killed were close friends described as “passionate, skilled skiers,” along with three professional guides.
Relatives identified the victims as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt.
The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that three employees from the Blackbird Mountain Guides-- Michael Henry, 30, Andrew Alissandratos, 34 and Nicole Choo, 42 -- also died in the avalanche.
“We are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Shannan Moon, the sheriff of Nevada County, California, as reported by NBC News.
Five of the victims were recovered and airlifted Friday by helicopter.
Fifteen skiers were caught in the avalanche. Six survived, including two who sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Multiple agencies have launched investigations into the avalanche. The Sierra Avalanche Center will prepare an incident report, Cal/OSHA is examining possible workplace safety violations, and the sheriff’s office is conducting its own inquiry.

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff has said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was always straight with him during their meetings.
"He’s never been anything other than straight with me, and I say that and I get attacked, but that’s an accurate statement. He’s told me that this is what his red lines are," Witkoff said in an interview with the Fox News TV channel.
He indicated that it was important for him to understand Russia’s position. "I got attacked for going to meet him eight times. How would you make a deal with someone on the other side unless you knew where the other person was coming from? I needed to understand what his motivations were, his goals and so forth. And I actually think that a lot of those meetings now are becoming very relevant," Witkoff said.
"So I think those meetings were important, and hopefully we’re going to consummate this whole thing," the official noted.

Orthodox Church celebrates Forgiveness Sunday

MINSK, 22 February (BelTA) - Orthodox believers celebrate Forgiveness Sunday today. This holiday concludes Maslenitsa week, after which Great Lent begins.
The Orthodox Church teaches: first reconcile with people, and only then seek the opportunity to be reconciled with God. Since ancient times, on this day people have asked each other for forgiveness for all visible and invisible offenses, and in response it was customary to say: “God will forgive” as if expressing the hope that in heaven the Lord will not hold it as a sin against a person for what they were forgiven for on this sinful earth. The Gospel of Matthew states: “For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.”
On this day, during the evening service in churches, the Rite of Forgiveness is performed in memory of the ancient custom of Egyptian monks. Before the start of Great Lent until Easter, they would disperse into the desert for 40 days to devote themselves entirely to prayers. Some of them never returned: some were torn apart by wild animals, others perished in the lifeless desert. Everyone understood that their meeting on the eve of Great Lent might be their last. Therefore, as they parted, the monks asked each other for forgiveness for all their wrongs, voluntary or involuntary, as if before death. Over time, this became a tradition among all believers.
On Forgiveness Sunday, believers attending the liturgy have the opportunity to hear the Gospel reading, which speaks of the forgiveness of sins, fasting, and storing up heavenly treasures. The Church provides guidance to believers on proper conduct during Great Lent and calls upon parishioners to repent to one another for all trespasses, to reconcile, and to forgive. One of the rules states, “judge not thy neighbor”. The priests themselves set a good example and are the first to ask forgiveness from their flock.
On this day, it is customary to visit the graves of deceased relatives and loved ones to mentally repent for any offenses ever caused to them.

Attacked in India, Kashmiri shawl sellers choose between safety, livelihood
A surge in attacks has forced many Kashmiris to return home. Others are devising survival strategies, such as WhatsApp groups where they alert each other about places to avoid.
Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir – Ayaz Ahmad stares at his screen, fingers moving rapidly as he types in a group chat on his mobile phone.
Ahmad, 28, goes around houses in Hisar, a city in northern India’s Haryana state, selling shawls and other handicraft items – like thousands of other itinerant traders from Indian-administered Kashmir, who crisscross the country on foot or bicycles.

But a spate of hate attacks faced by the shawl sellers in recent weeks has forced them to rethink and strategise what was once a common, winter-time sight across Indian cities: Kashmiris lugging large wraps holding shawls and other wares.
Ahmad now runs a WhatsApp group in which nearly two dozen members share information as they guide each other on areas to avoid.
“I guide them on where to go and where to avoid because some areas are fine, but others have seen harassment against our members,” Ahmad told Al Jazeera.
“Now, our priority is safety rather than business, as harassment incidents continue to happen to our members almost every day.”
‘Simply because of my identity’
Ahmad formed the WhatsApp group late last month after a Hindu shopkeeper in northern India’s Uttarakhand state hit Tabish Ahmad Ganie, an 18-year-old Kashmiri shawl seller, with an iron rod.
“This is a Hindu village. Kashmiri Muslims won’t work here at all,” the shopkeeper was heard shouting in a viral video of the attack, which left Ganie unconscious, while his elder brother Danish, who was also attacked, suffered minor injuries.
Ganie, a class 10 dropout, received 12 stitches on his head and his left arm. He is unable to walk due to fractures in his leg.
Bloodied, bandaged and wearing a sling, he told Al Jazeera the Hindu shopkeeper was accompanied by two others as they thrashed him brutally.
“Not for anything I had done, but simply because of my identity as a Kashmiri Muslim,” he said at his home in Kashmir’s Kupwara district, more than 800km (about 500 miles) from Uttarakhand’s Vikas Nagar area where he was attacked.
Ganie’s was not an isolated case, but part of a growing trend of attacks across India on Kashmiri traders and migrant workers, accompanied by a drumbeat of rhetoric against the region’s people on social media and at times, in public speeches from influential individuals linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). That rhetoric often depicts Kashmiris as “security threats” to India, and as “antinational” and “Pakistani agents”.
Since Modi came to power in 2014, anti-Muslim hate in India has soared — often patronised and fomented by leaders of the Hindu majoritarian BJP, and at times legitimised through dog whistles by the prime minister himself.
But Kashmiri Muslims carry a double burden — their faith and their homeland are both subjects of suspicion and widespread hatred in today’s India.
On Christmas Day, shawl vendor Bilal Ahmad was attacked by a Hindu group in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur district after he refused to chant “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” (Hail Mother India), a nationalist slogan that imagines India as a mother goddess. The slogan has been weaponised by the BJP and Hindu right-wing groups, who have often used it as a war cry in their campaign against Muslims and other minorities.
Bilal said his family grew concerned after seeing a video of the attack online.
“They called me and urged me to return to Kashmir because of the increasing attacks on Kashmiris. After facing harassment, I decided to close my business and came back to Kashmir,” he told Al Jazeera.
No easy choices
But returning to Kashmir is not an easy choice for many.
Rampant unemployment due to limited job opportunities in Kashmir often pushes young Kashmiris out of the region to look for livelihoods elsewhere, mainly the northern Indian states of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and the national capital territory of Delhi.
Since 2019, when Modi’s government scrapped the region’s decades-old partial autonomy guaranteed by the constitution and brought it under New Delhi’s direct control, a fledgling economy still recovering from the aftershocks of the move has compounded the job crisis.
However, anti-Kashmiri sentiments – and resultant attacks on them – spiked last year after a group of armed men attacked Indian tourists in Kashmir’s scenic Pahalgam area, killing 26 people. India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad rejected. The attack triggered a four-day air war between India and Pakistan — the neighbours that control parts of Kashmir but claim it in full — while diplomatic tensions and sporting boycotts continue.
In recent months, about 200 cases of attacks on Kashmiri students, shawl sellers or migrant workers have been reported across India. Many were beaten, threatened, harassed, and forced to leave the areas where they were living or doing business.
When Bashir Ahmad visited a Hindu-majority locality in early January to sell shawls in Punjab state’s Moga district, he was stopped and asked to show permission to conduct his business. He knew it was a mere pretext. Failing to show any permit, he was abused, and his bag of shawls was thrown on the ground.
The 50-year-old man returned to Kashmir after the incident and advised fellow shawl sellers to operate only in areas that other Kashmiris had found safe.
In neighbouring Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district, a retired Indian army soldier, Surjeet Rajput Guleria, abused and publicly interrogated an unidentified Kashmiri hawker on January 17, livestreaming the incident on Facebook.
The video shows him making anti-Muslim and sexually charged remarks, accusing Kashmiris of supporting Pakistan and engaging in pelting stones at Indian soldiers deployed in Kashmir. “Your sisters and daughters go to Pakistan and return pregnant,” he is heard saying in the video.
Local media reports said the Kangra police filed a report against Guleria, but no further action was taken.
On February 1, Guleria was back again – livestreaming his harassment of another Kashmiri hawker, Mohammad Ramzan, on Facebook.
“He threatened me and demanded that I leave the state. He went through my shawl bundles and mockingly accused me of carrying an AK-47 rifle instead of Kashmiri shawls,” Ramzan told Al Jazeera.
He said such targeting of migrants “not only jeopardises livelihoods but also reinforces a climate of fear that affects families” dependent on seasonal trade for survival.
It is not just shawl sellers who have suffered.
Abdul Hakeem, a resident of Kashmir’s Kulgam district, ran a fruit-selling business in Punjab’s Jalandhar city. He said he faced constant harassment from fellow Hindu vendors, and finally left the area on February 6, after he was given an ultimatum to either leave the state or face consequences.
“I had to leave fruits worth about 100,000 rupees [$1,100] behind and return to the valley because my family was afraid due to the rising attacks on Kashmiris outside the valley,” he told Al Jazeera.
His 50-year-old mother, Misra Begum, said they did not want him to continue his business if he did not feel safe. “We would rather go without food than see our son get into trouble,” she said.
‘Troubling pattern’
Kashmir’s main political parties — the governing National Conference and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — have urged the federal government, which effectively governs the region, to intervene and stop the attacks on Kashmiris across the country.
Calling the attacks “unacceptable”, Kashmir’s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said earlier this month he had raised the issue at a meeting of the chief ministers of the northern Indian states and appealed to them to prevent such incidents.
Abdullah’s predecessor, Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, alleged that the attackers operated with the backing of respective state authorities.
“[The] state governments appear to be granting silent patronage to mob violence, treating hatred as a shortcut to political success. The rule of law has been replaced by politics of fear,” she wrote on X on February 3, as she shared a video about an elderly Kashmiri man harassed in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh state.
BJP spokesman in Kashmir, Altaf Thakur, condemned the attacks on Kashmiri shawl sellers as “wrong and unacceptable”. He said the Kashmiris are an “inseparable part of the nation” and asserted the government would not tolerate such actions.
But Kashmiri lawmaker, Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, told Al Jazeera the attacks on Kashmiris are a “troubling pattern” that could not be ignored as they send “an alarming signal” to the people of Kashmir.
“Kashmiris, particularly small traders and shawl sellers, travel to different parts of the country to earn a livelihood, but repeated assaults and intimidation were causing fear and insecurity,” he said.

Kuwait summons Iraqi chargé d’affaires for Baghdad’s filing maritime coordinates with UN
Iraqi submission ‘infringes on its sovereignty’ over disputed maritime features, says Kuwait
ISTANBUL
Kuwait summoned Iraq’s chargé d’affaires on Saturday to protest Baghdad’s filing of maritime coordinates and a map with the UN, saying the submission “infringes on Kuwaiti sovereignty” over established maritime areas.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry said Iraq “had deposited a list of coordinates and a map with the UN that included claims regarding Iraqi maritime domains.”
It said the coordinates and map affect its sovereignty over maritime areas and fixed water elevations, including Fasht Al-Qaid and Fasht Al-Aij, which it described as not subject to any dispute regarding Kuwait’s full sovereignty.
The ministry said Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Rahim Al-Daihani summoned Zaid Abbas Shanshal “to deliver a formal protest note over Iraqi claims affecting Kuwait’s maritime sovereignty and related water elevations.”
Kuwait urged Iraq to take into account the historical ties between the two countries and to act responsibly in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), as well as bilateral understandings and agreements.
The UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 and establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing the world’s oceans, setting rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime zones, the peaceful use of seas and oceans, and the management of marine resources.
Earlier Saturday, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it had deposited updated lists of coordinates for Iraq’s territorial sea baselines and maritime zones with the UN secretary-general on Jan. 19 and Feb. 9, in accordance with UNCLOS provisions.
It said the submission includes the determination of straight baselines and baselines drawn along the low-water line for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea, as well as the delimitation of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of Iraq, in accordance with the internationally recognized World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
Baghdad said the deposit replaces previous submissions dated Dec. 7, 2021, and 15 April 2011, and aims “to update Iraq’s maritime data in line with the provisions of international law and enhance the legal clarity of the boundaries of maritime zones subject to Iraq’s sovereignty and sovereign rights.”
Iraq also said the coordinates and chart have been published on the website of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, and reiterated its commitment to international law and regional stability.
In August 1990, Iraq, under then-President Saddam Hussein, invaded Kuwait, leading to the 1991 Gulf War, during which a US-led international coalition expelled Iraqi forces after seven months.
Baghdad and Kuwait resumed diplomatic relations in 2003 following the fall of Saddam Hussein’s government.
After the invasion, the UN demarcated the land boundary between the two countries. But the demarcation did not settle all aspects of their maritime boundary, leaving certain maritime delimitation issues to be addressed bilaterally between the two oil-producing neighbors.

High energy prices threaten UK’s status as manufacturing power, business groups say
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-22
07:00:32 UTC
16:00:32 KST

The UK is at risk of losing its status as a major manufacturing centre after a sharp rise in energy prices that has forced about 40% of businesses to cut back investment, according to a report by the CBI and Energy UK.
In a stinging message to ministers, the report said British businesses – from chemical producers to pubs and restaurants – were being undermined by a failure to cap prices and upgrade the UK’s ageing gas and electricity networks.
A far-reaching review of outmoded regulations that govern the sale and supply of energy is also needed to spur investment and boost economic growth, the report said.
Energy UK, which represents more than 100 electricity generators and retailers, said business electricity costs remained 70% higher than before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while gas prices were 60% higher.
A survey underpinning the report found that almost 90% of firms have seen energy bills rise over the last five years and four in 10 had reduced investment as a result.
Without a reduction in energy bills, “the risk of job losses, production cuts, plant closures and offshoring will increase,” the report said.
The CBI and Energy UK said ministers needed to join forces with industry to conduct a comprehensive review of the UK’s energy needs and how they can be met during the transition to net zero.
A taskforce made up of researchers from both organisations and industry groups will consider how reforms could reduce prices and improve the efficiency of the gas and electricity networks.
The aim is to persuade ministers that initiatives to improve the UK’s energy system have not gone far enough, leaving the UK in danger of widespread deindustrialisation.
The UK has some of the most expensive industrial energy prices in the developed world. They are almost two-thirds above the median of International Energy Agency (IEA) countries and the highest among G7 members.
As an indication of the impact, figures covering 2025 show the UK’s trade in goods slumped to its worst performance on record. Britain reported a £248.3bn deficit for goods – £30.5bn more than the previous year.
The Office for National Statistics said the widening gap was only partly filled by a £192bn surplus in services, up £16.4bn from the previous year.
Last year the manufacturers’ lobby group, Make UK, said the government should provide millions of pounds in extra subsidies to prevent the industry from shrinking.
Louise Hellem, the CBI’s chief economist, said industrial sectors were already suffering severe financial pain from the dramatic rise in energy prices.
“You can see it already in the chemicals industry, which has seen several closures,” she said.
Hellem described this year as a “pivotal moment” for the UK’s industrial strategy.
Among medium-sized businesses, UK electricity prices are around double the EU median. Nondomestic gas prices are in line with the EU, the report said, but are considerably higher than the likes of the US and Canada.
“This acts as a brake on ambitions for economic growth. Also, businesses cannot invest in switching to clean energy – even though they know the long-term benefits of doing so – which again undermines one of the government’s key policies,” the report said.
Energy minister Ed Miliband has sought to protect some of the UK’s biggest users of energy. Last year, the government said it would cut electricity prices by up to £40 a megawatt hour for 7,000 “heavy users” to “move the UK from being an outlier to right in the middle of the pack”.
Dhara Vyas, the head of Energy UK, said she was concerned that thousands of businesses outside the ringfence would continue to be hampered by high energy bills.
The government had made significant progress on reducing domestic energy costs, she said. But the help on offer for some industrial users was not only “a sticking plaster”, but it was also being funded by other bill payers.
She added: “Lowering prices for all businesses is fundamental to the UK’s growth story.”
She said the initial report showed “how high energy costs are holding back the UK economy, and the limits of existing support”.
“But our aim will not be just about how to reduce bills. It will be the first of its kind to take a fundamental look at the energy market and the regulations to see how it can become more effective,” she said.

‘That’s a losing battle’: baboon incursions cause tense human-wildlife standoff in Cape Town
Unknown

16:00:31 KST

At the edge of Da Gama Park, where the Cape Town suburb meets the mountain, baboons jumped from the road to garden walls to roofs and back again. Children from South African navy families living in the area’s modest houses played in the street. Some were delighted; some wary; most were unfazed by the animals.
A few miles away, overlooking a soaring peak and sweeping bay, Nicola de Chaud showed photos of food strewn across her kitchen by a baboon. In another incident, a baboon threw one of her dogs across the veranda. In January, a male baboon lunged at her and refused to leave the house for 10 minutes.
“It has become really, really difficult and very traumatic actually,” said De Chaud, 61, a documentary maker who moved from Johannesburg to Simon’s Town five years ago.
Cape Town’s baboons have also caused conflict between humans, with a furious debate raging over whether the two species can coexist or whether baboons should be kept away from humans altogether.
During a 2024 protest against baboons entering the community of Kommetjie, a face-off between pro- and anti-baboon groups resulted in a person and a baboon being pepper sprayed.
The result is a “wicked problem”, said the 2025 Cape baboon management action plan. “No single solution can satisfy all parties or resolve the conflict in a final, definitive manner,” it added.
Most of Cape Town’s mountains are covered by the 25,000-hectare (61,750-acre) Table Mountain national park. However, the park is fragmented. The chacma baboons prefer to forage on low-lying land, much of which has been consumed by the city, whose population has grown 65% to 4.8 million from 2001 to 2022.
The number of baboons, which don’t have natural predators on the Cape Peninsula, has increased at a similar rate – from about 360 in 10 troops at the turn of the century to more than 600 in 17 troops in 2024, according to action plan data.
As many troops have become accustomed to foraging for calorific human food, more baboons have been shot, run over by cars, mauled by dogs or electrocuted. In 2013, four baboons died from human-related causes, according to an annual official baboon census. In 2024, it was 33.
For animal rights activists, residents should be responsible for coexisting with baboons, by locking up bins, securing doors and windows and training their dogs not to attack the animals.
Lynda Silk, a healer and activist, who educates people about living alongside nature, wants more accountability. “There’s been no successful prosecution for a person shooting a baboon,” she said.
For Tom Cohen, an American journalist who retired to Cape Town in 2019, peaceful urban coexistence is impossible. He described the two troops that frequent Simon’s Town as “hopelessly habituated and dependent on human food and settlements to survive,” adding: “They’re not wild baboons.”
Despite Cohen’s efforts to baboon-proof his home, in February 2025, they smashed a bathroom window to get in, breaking a microwave and leaving faeces. “The smell [of baboons] lingers, I can tell you that,” he said.
The three layers of government have agreed to build fences to keep baboons out of some areas and enforce a new bylaw with a “zero tolerance” approach to harming the primates.
In Simon’s Town, a fence has been deemed unworkable owing to the topography. So authorities have proposed moving the two troops to a sanctuary later this year. Euthanasia, which is anathema to animal rights activists, is to remain a last resort.
The whole plan is now under a legal challenge. Many activists are unhappy about the sanctuary. Some want to maintain the reliance on rangers, who shoot paintballs near baboons to scare them away from houses and whose management was taken over by the non-profit Cape Baboon Partnership in March 2025.
“What concerns us is that the decision to put them into a sanctuary, and even to cull them, was made before … the new management of the baboon rangers was settled,” said Sandie MacDonald, 54, who leads Cape Peninsula Civil Conservation, a non-profit organisation, with Lynda Silk. “The baboons are coming into the majority of those areas so much less.”
Nerine Dorman, 47, who lives in Welcome Glen, vehemently opposes the sanctuary: “You might as well just put them down, [rather] than relegate them to this living captivity.”
The rangers can’t solve the problem in Simon’s Town, though, said Joselyn Mormile, a Cape Baboon Partnership scientist who has studied South Africa’s baboons for 15 years. “That’s a losing battle that we are fighting every day to keep baboons and people happy there,” she said.
Mormile studied Rooi-Els, a village about 20 miles (32 km) south of Cape Town where residents opted for coexistence, for her PhD.
She found the mortality of baboons was still higher than in the wild, with 11 infant baboons killed by vehicles in four years. “I can never promote … sharing space,” she said.
Justin O’Riain, a University of Cape Town professor, said animal welfare activists bore some responsibility for the human-wildlife conflict.
He cited legal challenges that contributed to the authorities not taking important decisions about managing baboons, which he said ultimately led to one of the two Simon’s Town troops forming.
He said: “There’s never accountability for the people who complain about how baboons are managed, but do not provide a viable alternative.”

Romance fraud: warning over scam that turns victims into insurance cheats

Romance fraud typically evokes images of people being tricked out of their life savings by partners they meet on dating sites, but some scammers use a different tactic: recruiting unsuspecting victims into fake insurance claims.
The scam involves a fraudster convincing their partner, or a person they are dating, either to say they have witnessed a car accident, or to take out an insurance policy and file a bogus claim in order to secure a payout.
The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), a UK body working for insurers, says that although a number of cases have been detected over the last year it is likely some victims have not reported incidents.
Nicola Smith, intelligence and investigation manager at the IFB, says this may be because the scam does not centre on directly exploiting the victim for money.
“The generic reason that it might be going under-reported is because of the shame around the situation,” she says. “But also this tactic is different in that the target isn’t being hugely financially impacted. They’re not being asked for money. They’re being asked to use their identity.”
Last year, a man who manipulated women he met on dating sites into taking part in staged car crashes was sentenced at Bournemouth crown court to 20 months’ imprisonment.
Nathan Atkins persuaded the women to take part in planned crashes at specific locations. They then made personal injury claims, which insurers paid out on.
While the impact appears to have little financial effect on the victim, they risk being placed on the insurance fraud register. This can make getting another insurance policy very difficult and affect their credit score.
“What you’re being targeted for is your identity,” says Smith. “And it’s really important to know that if you’re complicitly taking part in this, you are committing fraud along with them.”
What it looks like
The scammer identifies victims they feel they can persuade to be complicit in fraud, rather than because they have savings. “You don’t have to have lots of money to be a target of this scam because all they need is your identity,” says Smith. “What they want from you is your agreement to take part in a scam.”
At some point the victim might be asked to take part in the insurance fraud by saying that they witnessed an accident; or they were in a car when an accident happened; or they were injured as a result of an accident.
Often, the fraudster will give the victim a script or an account of what happened that they should follow. “It could be just being arranged to answer a phone call from an insurer where they were asked ‘Were you a passenger in this car’?” says Smith.
“But ultimately, to be directly involved in the scam, you would be being asked to lie to an insurer.”
What to do
If you meet someone on a dating app who asks you to be involved in anything illegal, then report the person on the app.
Screenshots can be sent to the police and to the service Report Fraud.
The Insurance Fraud Bureau operates Cheatline, a confidential online tool to report fraud.
Like many frauds, a sense of urgency is often used by the scammer to get you to act quickly and make decisions you might normally not do under different circumstances. The IFB says that if someone needs your help urgently, you should offer to contact the emergency services. If they decline, you should be wary and end any further conversation.

‘A natural paradise’: the south of France’s beautiful blue lagoon

When I asked Nordine Nid Hsain, the owner of my favourite Parisian bistro, why he sold up and left the capital to join the arty diaspora living in the Mediterranean port of Sète, he said: “What really drew me here was not Sète itself, but the natural paradise of the adjoining Thau lagoon. I love cycling and, after 10 years here, I am still excited to go out every day to explore the bike paths that run around the lagoon.”
He added: “There’s always something new to discover – beaches; wetland landscapes; enjoying a plate of freshly harvested oysters at the water’s edge; riding through the vineyards then tasting the wine in the vigneron’s cellar.”
It sounded irresistible, and even though I have no plans to up sticks from Paris, I bought a train ticket and arrived in Sète three and half hours later to explore this hidden corner of the Mediterranean.
Although officially classed an étang (a lake), Thau is actually a sprawling lagoon, separated from the Mediterranean by the Lido, a narrow 9-mile-long beach. I based myself on the lagoon side, in the quiet port of Mèze, where my no-frills room in the affordable Hôtel du Port had a balcony overlooking a tiny harbour lined with fishing smacks and pleasure boats.
The biggest surprise about Mèze is that there are two beaches tucked away in the centre of town, perfect for an undisturbed early dip. Two minutes from the hotel, La Plagette sits beneath the medieval Chapelle des Pénitents, which glows yellow in the morning sun. On the other side of the harbour, La Pinède is a pine-clad stretch of sand, part of La Conque wetlands reserve, that hugs the banks of the lagoon, and is on the walking and cycle route that offers opportunities to spot flamingos.
Most of the countryside surrounding Thau is covered with vineyards, the lagoon waters glinting in the background. The most famous wine is Picpoul de Pinet, a crisp white that’s become popular in the UK. Pinet itself is a sleepy hamlet of wineries, and at historic Domaine Gaujal, the fifth-generation owners, Audrey and Laurent Gaujal, welcome visitors like family friends. They offer an extensive tasting, including an organic Picpoul aged in ceramic amphora, followed by a tour of the cellar, free of charge.
My last stop for the day was the ancient Roman port of Marseillan at the tip of the lagoon. Between the grand mansions and fishers’ cottages, the cobbled alleys remain untouched by modernity – a testament to the preservation of the lagoon’s natural beauty. Just by the old port stands the grand stone warehouse of Noilly Prat, where France’s famous vermouth has been produced since 1813.
Recently refurbished, it has an elegant tasting room in the cellar and a bar where locals go for after-work cocktails. An immense courtyard at the back is filled with hundreds of wooden barrels left to age their secret recipe of botanicals. Outside, the bustling quay is lined with reasonably priced seafood restaurants, such as Brasserie Galinette (mains from about €20), specialising in sea bream and cuttlefish, a perfect alfresco dinner as the sun sets over the lagoon.
The next day I headed out to Bouzigues, a fishing village that gives its name to the lagoon’s most famous oysters. The oyster fields are what mark Thau out from other wetlands – an Escher-like maze of hundreds of “tables” opposite the shore, where thousands of oysters grow.
The ostréiculteurs operate from ramshackle huts on the water’s edge, zipping back and forth in boats to their wooden cabins, many of which double up as waterside eateries.
At Le Cercle des Huîtres, Irene Salas Fernandez served some of the best oysters I have ever eaten: freshly shucked, made into a tangy ceviche, deep-fried tempura style, or baked with delicious sauces such as bourbon and smoked paprika. Fernandez and her partner Sebastian moved here from Barcelona and started farming only three years ago. I was shocked when Sebastian told me: “We only cultivate oysters today since the farming of mussels, which Bouzigues was also famous for, has almost disappeared due to global warming. The lagoon’s water is becoming too hot in summer for these fragile molluscs to survive.”
I resisted the temptation of a dip in the azure waters off Bouzigues’s beach, Plage de la Pyramide, and headed inland to Valmagne Abbey. This magnificent 11th-century monastery was deconsecrated during the French Revolution and the gothic church was transformed into a wine cellar. Today, the owners still run a vineyard, operate a farm-to-table organic restaurant and store their immense barrels of wine inside the church itself.
Before heading back to Sète station, I drove the length of the Lido’s sand dunes, which are almost deserted out of season. Parisian photographer Pierre-Emmanuel Rastoin was taking a late afternoon dip with his brother, who lives in the nearby winemaking village of Frontignan. “This is the perfect place to escape to,” he said, “as long as you avoid the summer months.”
But one of the biggest attractions of this corner of the south of France is that even in peak season – when holidaymakers descend on the campsites and caravan parks, unpacking deckchairs, cabanas and sun umbrellas – it is always possible to find a quiet, spot along this beach.
The trip was provided by the Archipel de Thau tourism office. Hôtel du Port has doubles from €65 B&B

‘It helps with loneliness’: grief, play and the power of lifelike dolls - photo essay
Unknown

“It’s a doll,” Ineke Schmelter, 71, often says as she walks down the street with a pram and someone peers fondly under the hood, asking: “How old is the baby?” Then she pulls back the blanket and reveals the doll. She points out the craftsmanship – the little veins, the creases in the skin – and explains that it can take as many as 20 layers of paint to achieve such a lifelike finish. Sometimes, though, she can’t be bothered with the long version – the explanations, the strange looks. “As if I’m not quite right in the head.” Then she just says: “Two months,” and keeps walking.
Schmelter is one of many reborn doll lovers: dolls so realistic they are almost indistinguishable from real babies. She bought her first around four years ago, when she retired and didn’t know what to do with her free time. She had spent her whole working life with babies and children. First as a nurse in hospital, later as a maternity nurse. She missed the daily contact: the tiny grabbing hands, that warm little body in her arms. At first she mainly bought old dolls on Marktplaats and restored them, but when she saw a real reborn baby for the first time, she was hooked. She bought her first for €400 (£350) from a collector: a sleeping baby. She now has 10 dolls displayed around her home. The most expensive cost €1,200.
“I trawl charity shops looking for vintage clothes and baby bottles,” says Schmelter. “It’s often a trip down memory lane. When I dress a doll, I chat to it a little, and when I’m watching television I sometimes sit one on my lap. I don’t walk that easily any more and I really should be using a walker. But I’d rather take a little stroll behind the pram and put a doll in it. I’ve always worked very irregular hours, so I don’t have many friends now. It helps with the loneliness.”
The dolls originated in the US, where hobbyists in the 1990s began hand-modifying mass-produced dolls. Today, they have millions of enthusiasts worldwide: makers, collectors and carers who dress and cherish them. They gather in Facebook groups where they don’t just share photos or offer dolls for sale, but also exchange private stories. On TikTok and YouTube, “a day in the life” videos – in which dolls are cared for as if they were real babies – rack up hundreds of thousands of views.
According to Nicolle Lamerichs, a researcher of fan culture and lecturer at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, the dolls are popular because they bring together different kinds of play. “Children’s play is often mainly about storytelling, but with adults it works differently. You need multiple elements to make something appealing: creativity, role play, collecting, and a community of like-minded people. You see all of that with reborn dolls. And if you add emotion, the attraction becomes even stronger. With these dolls, that emotion is also very intimate. Some women use them as a way of remembering a child who died, or a longing for a child that never came true. In our culture, there is often little space for that darker side of motherhood – but in the Facebook groups there is.”
Prices vary widely: from a budget doll of about €300 to several thousand euros for one by a well-known artist. Everything is handmade. The head, arms and legs are usually vinyl; more expensive dolls are made of silicone. First a mould is sculpted in clay, then it is cast. After that, the doll is painted in many layers and baked. Often, real human hair is rooted into the head one strand at a time. The body is filled with glass granules so that it weighs the same as a real baby. Online, unpainted kits are also for sale – ideal for hobbyists.
Still, love for these dolls is not without its downsides. Anyone who takes a doll out on the street quickly attracts strange looks or blunt reactions. Online, enthusiasts receive hateful messages, and the hobby is often dismissed as bizarre, or even sick. In Brazil, where “a day in the life” TikTok videos now generate substantial advertising revenue, a rush has begun – to the point where some women even take their dolls to hospital and, mainly for social media, pretend they are real babies. Authorities are considering legislation, the media are full of the commotion, and many people say these women are “crazy” because they think the doll is real. For Dutch enthusiasts, this is a recognisable caricature of the hobby: an image that often ignores the genuine love people have for the dolls.
Lamerichs is not surprised. “Hobbies that are popular with women often carry less status. I’m a gamer, for example, and I have Lego – lots of people think that’s cool. But my Barbies and dolls, they find weird and childish. That’s because women’s hobbies often have a strong emotional component, and emotions are still brushed aside in our culture. Just look at how women who show emotion are still labelled hysterical. It’s deeply woven into our culture.”
The fact that reborn dolls also disturb the idealised image of motherhood and babies does not help, she says. “Motherhood is still seen as the highest achievement a woman can reach. It’s almost revered in our culture. So if you show up with a kind of ‘fake baby’, you immediately start poking at that ideal, and that makes people uncomfortable – and sometimes even angry.”
Lamerichs believes we often underestimate how important play is – not just for children, but for adults, too. “A hobby with a role-play element can help people process things. You see it in all kinds of therapy and coaching programmes. Look at the popularity of family constellation work, where you literally act out scenes from your childhood. By playing out emotions, you learn how to live with them.”
Various studies have also found that the dolls can have a positive effect on older people with dementia: among other things, they reduce aggressive and obsessive behaviour, encourage communication, and improve mood. Some psychologists also use the dolls as a form of therapy for people with, for example, an anxiety disorder or autism. Looking at the dolls triggers the release of “feelgood” chemicals in the brain, and because they feel like a real baby, holding them can be comforting – comparable to the effect of a weighted blanket.
“When I walk through the park with my doll, I sometimes take a photo and post it in a Facebook group,” says Schmelter. “Women will say: I can’t believe you dare. Lots of people are ashamed of their hobby and keep it secret. That’s such a shame. As a nurse, I sometimes saw grown men being wheeled into an operating theatre with a teddy bear in their arms. So why shouldn’t we be allowed to watch television with a doll on our lap? I’m proud of the hobby I have. The first doll I made myself, I gave to a girl I knew through the Facebook group. She desperately wanted one, but couldn’t afford it. She was so happy she named the doll after me.”

Thailand sees Lunar New Year travel boom as Chinese tourists back in droves
The country’s heavy investment in wooing Chinese visitors appears to have paid off as it overcomes safety fears to secure holiday growth
Resorts are near capacity in Pattaya, Bangkok restaurants are doing a roaring trade and the strict time slots to visit the Louis Vuitton pop-up “hotel” in the Thai capital are fully booked.
An army of Chinese influencers has been hired targeting multigenerational family groups and Gen Z travellers who shun large tours. This supports the country’s biggest ever tourism promotion campaign launched last month starring Lalisa “Lisa” Manobal, the Thai-born member of the K-pop girl group Blackpink.
While the final Lunar New Year arrivals data are yet to be released, anecdotally the investment appears to have paid off.

According to Ukrinform, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported this on Facebook, publishing operational information as of 8:00 a.m. on Sunday, February 22.
“The Defense Forces are successfully repelling attempts by the occupiers to strengthen their position and advance further into Ukrainian territory, disrupting their plans and inflicting significant losses on the enemy in terms of personnel and equipment,” the statement said.
According to the General Staff, yesterday the Russian army launched one missile and 97 air strikes, using, in particular, 280 guided aerial bombs.
The invaders also used 8,328 kamikaze drones. They fired on populated areas and Ukrainian defense positions 3,389 times, including 80 times with multiple launch rocket systems.

One combat engagement was recorded in the Northern Slobozhanshchyna and Kursk sectors over the past day. In these areas of the front, the Russians carried out 74 shellings, including six with the use of multiple launch rocket systems, and also dropped four guided aerial bombs.
In the Southern Slobozhanshcyna sector, the Russian army attempted to break through the defensive lines in the Dvorichanske area once.
In the Kupiansk sector, the invaders attacked four times in the Pishchane area.
In the Lyman sector, Russian troops carried out six attacks, attempting to break through the defenses in the areas of Hrekivka, Stavky, Drobysheve, and Masliakivka.

Explosions rocked Ukraine’s capital Kyiv early on Sunday with officials warning of a ballistic missile attack, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4:00 am (0200 GMT), shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert warning nationwide citing the threat of missiles.

“The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons,” the head of Kyiv’s military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram, urging people to remain in shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that two wounded people, a woman and a child, were rushed to hospitals from the suburbs.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on February 24, 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Moscow has intensified its winter assaults on energy and military infrastructure.
Temperatures had plunged to nearly -10C when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
Tkachenko said the attacks had caused a fire on the roof of a residential building.
The bombardment prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Poland’s Operational Command said early Sunday it was scrambling jets after detecting “long‑range aviation of the Russian federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.

It also came hours after blasts in Lviv, a western city near the Polish border that rarely sees deadly attacks.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and injuring 15 people after officers responded to a reported break‑in.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
- Ukraine ‘not losing’ -
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia’s assault on February 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told AFP on Friday that Ukraine was “definitely not losing” the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300 square kilometres (116 square miles) of territory in recent counter‑attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv’s most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Elon Musk following a plea from Kyiv, have enabled the push, according to Zelensky.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks since in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.
Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, said on X on Saturday he planned consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wanted deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Turkey.

White House leak: Trump will strike Iran on Monday or Tuesday

ALBAWABA - John Kiriakou, an American journalist and whistleblower, said that a former CIA officer told him that U.S. President Donald Trump has decided to launch an attack on Iran on Monday or Tuesday.
Kiriakou said that his friend, who is a CIA officer, was at the White House on Friday morning and told him, "A decision has been made to attack Iran on Monday or Tuesday." He continued that Trump gave Tehran 10 days to accept the U.S. proposal to end their missile program and uranium enrichment program, in addition to ending Iran's support to groups in the Middle East, like Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis.
Kiriakou, who's also a former high-ranking CIA officer, also revealed that Trump might give Iran 10 days more or less and then launch a surprise attack.
John Kiriakou quoted the source as saying that Vice President J.D. Vance and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are the only dissenting voices to launch an attack on Iran, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have shown their full support for the decision.
On the other hand, Axios reported, citing senior Trump advisers that the U.S. president has not yet made up his mind regarding launching strikes against Iran. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told the news agency on Saturday that several people around Trump are against bombing Tehran, but Graham confirmed that he is in favor of attacking Iran.
On Thursday, Trump said that he had given Iran a maximum of 15 days before Washington would take any action, warning of "bad things" if Iran did not reach an agreement on its nuclear program.
When reporters later pressed him for clarification, he added, "You'll probably find out in the next 10 days. I think that's enough time... 10 or 15 days maximum."
However, the US president did not specify a timeframe, merely reiterating his warning of "truly dire consequences" and emphasizing that "Iran will have to make a deal one way or another."

Russia’s war in Ukraine outlasts Soviet war against Nazi Germany
Unknown

Last month, Russia’s full-scale war with Ukraine crossed a grim, symbolic threshold: 1,418 days. It is now officially longer than the time it took the Soviet Union to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.
For a Kremlin that frequently leans on the legacy of the "Great Patriotic War," the comparison is a sobering one. While the Red Army’s momentum eventually carried it all the way to Berlin, Moscow’s current campaign is bogged down in a gruelling struggle just to secure Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.
What began in February 2022 as a failed lightning strike to seize Kiev and topple the government has devolved into a static, 1,200-kilometre front of brutal trench warfare.
The cost of this deadlock has been catastrophic. With nearly 2 million soldiers estimated killed, wounded, or missing, the war has cemented its place as the bloodiest conflict on European soil since 1945.
Russia has occupied roughly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which it illegally annexed in 2014. But gains since the February 24, 2022, invasion have been slow and costly.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte recently compared Moscow’s advance to “the speed of a garden snail.” In the Donetsk region, Russian troops have inched forward only about 50 kilometres over the past two years in fierce battles for key strongholds.
The Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies estimates Russian casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed. Ukrainian losses are estimated at up to 600,000 troops, including as many as 140,000 dead.
The think tank said Russia has suffered the highest casualty rate of any major power in a war since World War II, advancing at an average of just 70 meters a day over two years in its effort to capture transport hubs such as Pokrovsk.
Drones have reshaped the battlefield in unprecedented ways, making it nearly impossible for either side to mass troops undetected. Ukraine initially used drones to offset Russia’s advantage in firepower, but Moscow has since expanded its drone operations, including fibre-optic-tethered models that evade electronic jamming.
The combination of high-tech drone warfare and World War I-style trench fighting has forced small infantry units to infiltrate devastated towns under constant surveillance. Supplying front-line troops and evacuating the wounded has become increasingly perilous.
Russia has intensified long-range strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, causing repeated blackouts in Kiev and other cities during winter. It has also targeted power lines to fragment the national grid.
Ukraine has responded with drone and missile attacks on Russian oil refineries and military assets, sinking several warships in the Black Sea and forcing Moscow to redeploy its fleet from Crimea to Novorossiysk. In a bold operation code-named “Spiderweb,” Ukrainian drones launched from trucks struck air bases deep inside Russia, damaging long-range bombers.
US-mediated peace efforts have faltered amid sharply conflicting demands. President Vladimir Putin insists Ukraine withdraw from the four regions Moscow claims, abandon its NATO aspirations, limit its military and grant official status to the Russian language. Ukraine has rejected those terms.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire along current lines but refuses territorial concessions without firm security guarantees.
Both sides accuse the other of stalling negotiations. Analysts argue that beyond territory, Moscow’s broader aim is to ensure Ukraine remains within Russia’s sphere of influence.
While Western sanctions, inflation and labour shortages have strained Russia’s economy, defence production has ramped up, and key social groups have been shielded from hardship. Despite mounting costs and historically slow battlefield gains, the Kremlin appears capable of sustaining the war for now.

'It's already a Belarusian brand’: Maslenitsa festivities in full swing in Minsk

Maslenitsa week in Belarus is drawing to a close, but its most vibrant part is just gaining momentum. Drawn by the aroma of fragrant pancakes with a variety of fillings, thousands of people are flocking to the festivities despite the frosty weather. They are kept warm not only by the food but also by dancing, and there will also be chances to work up a sweat in various contests. A BelTA correspondent visited the celebration on the square near the Palace of Sports, where Minsk residents and guests are summoning a sunny spring.
Music and Belarusian songs could be heard far from the concert venue. The singing was periodically interrupted by the loud and energetic voice of the permanent host of Maslenitsa in Minsk, Maria Fedorenko. For her, this holiday means a good mood, wonderful people, and, most importantly, the imminent arrival of warm weather
“Maslenitsa is our Belarusian brand, our roots; this holiday was created by our distant ancestors. Today, it is celebrated brightly and beautifully in any city. And our guests today have a chance to test their wit, ingenuity, and all sorts of other qualities,” she said.
On 21 February, the festivities in the capital city continued until eight in the evening, with a vibrant mood created by folk bands, honored and professional groups, and popular Belarusian artists and modern hits on the theme of Maslenitsa.
The main focus of the holiday is traditional Maslenitsa cuisine, everything connected with pancakes, fluffy fritters, butter, milk, and cheese. There are six locations, each adhering to the theme. There are interactive zones: for example, at one, you need to toss a plush pastry onto a frying pan to win a prize.
“We’ve prepared Maslenitsa mazes of pancakes are hung from above, and a person must walk past them blindfolded, slipping through like butter. We’re also offering free coffee in cooperation with the Defense Ministry. You can warm up, dance, and have fun. And then there's the tradition of a mother-in-law testing her son-in-law's manliness - games where you can measure your strength, including a wooden barbell for that purpose,” he noted.
There are indeed a great many trials and entertainments: each one is tied to a specific day of Maslenitsa week. For example, on Thursday, guests are invited to go horseback riding and navigate various obstacles; at another spot, they can play “lyndy” (a type of traditional game); and on Monday, they can spin the Maslenitsa wheel and try to win a sweet lollipop. But even if you don’t win anything, it's no big deal. You'll get a large sticker with a bright sun to attach to your clothes. Some guests have a lot of such stickers, which means they've participated in almost all the contests and are having a great time.
“Experience shows that people really enjoy the holiday. Last year, Maslenitsa lasted for one day, and drew about 6,000-7,000 visitors a. It attracts people with its openness and cheerful atmosphere, thanks to the games. The contests are different each time and always adhere to the concept,” the director explained.
The main highlight of the program is, of course, the pancakes. They are baked in every stall along the long trade row. Besides the usual ones with cheese and ham, you can also find something new, for example: with salmon, fish spread, hot shashlik, or caviar. And if one pancake isn't enough, you can grab some meat and salad snacks, hot corn, potatoes, or grilled shrimps. Together, they were taking photos with animators who had arrived on a “stove”, that has small wheels underneath, dressed as Baba Yaga and other fairy-tale characters.
“Usually we organize children's contests, but today we've eaten and are having a good time. It’s especially delicious to eat hot pancakes in the cold and warm up with them. This is our first time here; the last time I was at Maslenitsa was a very long time ago, back in childhood. The atmosphere is very cool,” a girl said.Russians are also getting acquainted with Belarusian culture through Maslenitsa. For example, Oksana Shulmina, along with her husband Dmitry and son Savely, came to Minsk from Yekaterinburg. “We ended up here by chance, and we really like it. It's non-stop entertainment not only for children but also for adults. The groups are performing great; we are enjoying the holiday and feeling the Belarusian hospitality,” the guest said.
On 21 February, the festivities in the capital city continued until eight in the evening, with a vibrant mood created by folk bands, honored and professional groups, and popular Belarusian artists and modern hits on the theme of Maslenitsa.
Dmitry Sergeychuk, the principal director of the holiday, said that the main concept of the Minsk Maslenitsa was inspired by the diverse ritual foods of Belarusians. Meanwhile, we looked around and noticed other details: the stage was designed in the shape of a huge oven, and tall, brightly decorated fir trees were placed on the square. It might seem that the concept has nothing to do with spring, but that's only at first glance.
“Back in the day, in the central region of our country people used to decorate fir trees with ribbons on this day, and we decided to incorporate this into the thematic design,” Dmitry Sergeychuk explained. The main focus of the holiday is traditional Maslenitsa cuisine, everything connected with pancakes, fluffy fritters, butter, milk, and cheese. There are six locations, each adhering to the theme.

The celebration of spring will continue on Sunday and culminate in the burning of the effigy. This traditional ritual will help cleanse bad thoughts and let new, bright things into life.

Iran will not bow down to US pressure in nuclear talks, Pezeshkian says
Iranian president vows to stand firm as Trump threatens strikes and the US bolsters its military presence in the Gulf.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian has pledged not to fold to pressure from the United States after his American counterpart, Donald Trump, said he was considering limited strikes to force a deal on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
Pezeshkian’s comments on Saturday came amid high tensions in the Gulf, with the US continuing to grow its military presence with the deployment of two aircraft carriers and dozens of jets.

“We will not bow down in the face of any of these difficulties,” Pezeshkian said at a ceremony to honour members of the Iranian Paralympics team.
“World powers are lining up with cowardice to force us to bow our heads. Just as you did not bow down in the face of difficulties, we will not bow down in the face of these problems,” he said.
Iran and the US resumed indirect talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme in Oman earlier this month, and held a second round in Switzerland last week.
Although Washington and Tehran described the talks in overall positive terms, they failed to achieve a breakthrough.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that a diplomatic solution appeared within “our reach” and that his country was planning to finalise a draft deal in “the next two to three days” to send to Washington.
Crossroads
Al Jazeera’s Tohid Asadi, reporting from Tehran, said the two countries appear to be at a “crossroads once again” and that residents of the Iranian capital were watching closely for signs of diplomatic progress.
“How can anyone not worry about war?” one woman told Al Jazeera. “Even if we don’t worry about ourselves, we worry about our children’s future.”
A businessman said he believed military confrontation was eventually inevitable “because what the Americans want is surrender, and the Iranian state won’t accept that”.
“If that happens, conditions will become even harder – business is already slow,” he added.
Another man was more optimistic.
“The US knows it can’t overpower Iran,” he said. “The US hasn’t truly won a war in any country, say Afghanistan, Iraq or Vietnam. In the end, it will bow to Iran. People shouldn’t worry.”
Iran and the US engaged in nuclear talks last year, too, but the effort collapsed when Israel launched attacks on the country, triggering a 12-day war. The US joined in by bombing three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.
Trump issued new threats of military action in January following a deadly Iranian crackdown on antigovernment protesters. Tehran responded by threatening to strike US military bases in the region and warning that it could close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for oil exports for the Gulf Arab states.
Greatest air power since 2003
According to the US media, the airpower Washington is amassing in the region is the greatest since its invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the past few days, Washington has deployed more than 120 aircraft to the Middle East, while the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, is on its way to join the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group already positioned in the Arabian Sea.
Iran emphasised in a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Friday that the build-up “must not be treated as mere rhetoric”.
Although Iran is not seeking “tension or war and will not initiate a war”, any US aggression will be responded to “decisively and proportionately”, the letter added.
The letter came after Trump claimed on Thursday during his inaugural Board of Peace meeting that “bad things will happen” without a “meaningful deal”.
Clarifying his remarks on Air Force One later that day, Trump said Iran had “10, 15 days, pretty much, maximum”.
On Friday, in response to a reporter’s question on whether the US could take limited military action as the countries negotiate, Trump said, “I guess I can say I am considering that.” A few hours later, he told reporters that Iran “better negotiate a fair deal”.
Fears of a regional conflict have prompted countries including Sweden, Serbia, Poland and Australia to advise their citizens in Iran to leave the country.

Russia attacked Kyiv with ballistic and cruise missiles as overnight strikes in the Black Sea port of Odesa and central Ukraine targeted energy infrastructure, Ukrainian military officials said Sunday. The attacks came just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Follow our liveblog for the latest developments.
Russia targets Ukraine's energy infrastructure in drone strikes
Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure and killing at least one person, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday. Reporting from Kramatorsk, FRANCE 24’s Gulliver Cragg said the strikes on the city appeared to have been unsuccessful, as no power cuts had been reported so far.
Russia launched 50 missiles, 297 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv's air force says
Russia launched 50 missile and 297 drones in overnight attacks against Ukraine, Ukraine's air force said on Sunday.
Air defence units shot down or neutralised 33 missiles and 274 drones, the air force said in a post on Telegram.
Police officer killed, 24 people injured in bombs explosions in Lviv
One police officer was killed and 24 other people were injured after several explosive devices detonated at midnight in Lviv in western Ukraine, the National Police said on Sunday.
"It has been preliminarily established that homemade explosive devices detonated," the police said on the Telegram messaging service.
The police said that the first explosion occurred after a patrol crew arrived at the suspected scene of a shop break-in, while the second explosion occurred a little later.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called the incident a terrorist act.
Overnight strikes target energy infrastructure in Odesa, central Ukraine
Overnight Russian strikes also hit the Black Sea port Odesa and central Ukraine, said Ukrainian officials.
Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper wrote on Telegram that a drone attack on the energy infrastructure of the region caused fires that had been extinguished.
Russia attacks the Ukrainian energy system almost daily, striking thermal power plants and electrical substations.
Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector are important elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.
Russian missiles, drones strike Kyiv
Russia attacked Ukraine with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure, the Ukrainian military and local officials said on Sunday.
At least one person was injured in the Kyiv region, with damage reported in five districts where more than a dozen houses were damaged, regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on the Telegram messaging app.

A democratic Iran could become Israel's ally, regional power

Governments across the Middle East are watching developments in Iran with mounting unease. The threat of a regional war is not the only issue, nor is the Iranian regime's threats to attack US sites and forces.
Two main scenarios worry the Arab states. The first is large scale chaos and civil war inside Iran, with spillover effects across the region. Such instability could trigger waves of refugees and disrupt shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf, a vital artery for Gulf economies.
The second scenario, seen by Israel the as optimistic one, is the rapid collapse of the Islamic Republic and the rise of a pro Western government in Tehran. Over time, that could transform Iran into a rising regional power.
"In the end, Arab states want the Islamic Republic to remain," an Iranian exile told Israel Hayom. "They fear a free Iran in the future, because they know that a free and democratic Iran would become Israel's first ally in the Middle East. Their double game or the Muslim Brotherhood project would no longer have buyers."
The exile argued that the regime's threats should be put in proportion. "The Islamic Republic's ultimate power lies in threats. These are empty threats of disrupting regional order for days and harming the economy and livelihoods of billions. That is why any blow to the Islamic Republic must be severe and effective, until it falls. Otherwise the regime will become bolder and more dangerous than before."
Against this backdrop, the strategy of most Arab states becomes clearer: embrace the regime diplomatically, while assisting mediation efforts with the US.
Egypt
The head of Iran's Interests Section in Cairo, Mojtaba Ferdowsi-Pour, issued a dramatic statement Friday announcing that a final decision had been made to exchange ambassadors between Iran and Egypt, with only a formal declaration pending. If implemented, the move would fully restore relations severed after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Although lower level diplomatic channels have existed over the years, the announcement signals warming ties from the Egyptian side, which seeks to distance itself from a regional confrontation. The previous regional flare up following the war against the Hamas terrorist organization in Gaza led to disruptions in the Suez Canal and heavy financial losses for Egypt. Cairo has no interest in renewed Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
Qatar
The Gulf emirate, which hosts terrorist organizations, has much to lose from a war with Iran. The Al Udeid Air Base on its territory hosts thousands of US troops. Instability in the Persian Gulf could also damage its economy, which relies heavily on gas exports shipped by sea.
Qatar is therefore operating on two tracks. Diplomatically, it is passing messages between Iran and the US in an effort to preserve negotiations aimed at preventing war. Over the weekend, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani conveyed a message to his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi that talks were "still ongoing."
Militarily, Qatar is relying on US defense systems being deployed to the region, in addition to American made systems it already possesses.
Saudi Arabia
The kingdom is increasing coordination with Iran in hopes of preventing an attack on US forces stationed on Saudi soil. On the sidelines of an international naval exercise in India, Milan 2026, a trilateral meeting was reportedly held between senior naval officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran. Discussions focused on improving maritime cooperation, including combating piracy, securing shipping lanes and crisis management.
This follows talks several weeks ago between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. The crown prince reportedly delivered conciliatory messages and pledged that he "would not allow any action from his territory."
Oman
The sultanate has emerged as the most significant Gulf mediator between Iran and the US. After the latest round of talks in Geneva, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said progress had been made and that the atmosphere was constructive. Still, it remains unclear whether Oman will succeed this time.
Diplomatic sources aligned with Iran said the US side raised the issues of ballistic missiles and regional involvement, while the Iranian delegation insisted on focusing solely on the nuclear file. According to a report in Al Akhbar, US envoy Steve Witkoff warned the Iranians that such insistence "would not be to their benefit."
United Arab Emirates
Officials in Abu Dhabi, like others in the region, have made clear they will not allow any attack on Iran to be launched from their territory, possibly in the hope that the regime in the Islamic Republic will limit its response. There is also concern about the economic impact of a regional conflict on the federation.
According to Reuters, stock markets in the UAE already fell Friday after investors reacted to a US ultimatum demanding that Iran reach an agreement within days or "suffer." At the same time, Emirati commentators argue that Tehran has lost most of its leverage and is at a dead end.
Kuwait
The emirate has also expressed concern. Earlier this month, senior Kuwaiti politician Abdullah al-Nafisi questioned why negotiations between Iran and the US could not be direct. "Wouldn't that be faster and avoid the tensions associated with indirect talks?" he asked. On another occasion, he predicted the talks would fail because President Donald Trump views the Iranian issue as the only solution to his "domestic problems."
Iraq
Amid the regional turmoil, Baghdad appears mired in political gridlock. The pro Iranian Shiite bloc had intended to nominate Nouri al-Maliki for prime minister. However, the US and various Iraqi actors quickly voiced opposition to a candidate seen as close to Tehran. As a result, alternative, less controversial names are now reportedly under consideration.
A US strike on Iran could plunge Iraq into chaos due to Shiite militias loyal to the Iranian regime. However, in January 2026 the US completed its withdrawal from its last major base in Iraq, Ain al-Asad. That development narrows the range of potential targets available to Tehran.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate to 15 pct

15:44:36 KST

President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."
Shortly after the court's 6-3 ruling that rejected the president's authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, the Republican launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their "disloyalty" and calling them "fools and lap dogs."
The ruling was a stunning rebuke by the high court, which has largely sided with the president since he returned to office, and marked a major political setback in striking down Trump's signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.
Saturday's announcement is sure to provoke further uncertainty as Trump carries on with a trade war that he has used to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.
It is the latest move in a process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
The new duty by law is only temporary — allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the U.S. under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.
On Friday, the White House said U.S. trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
High court defeat
Friday's court ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminum and various other goods. Government probes still under way could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
But it nevertheless marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee — thanking them "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
The president alleged the majority of six justices, including two nominated during his first term, had been "swayed by foreign interests."
"I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence," he said.
Shares on Wall Street — a metric closely watched by Trump — rose modestly Friday after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the Supreme Court's ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Kavanaugh noted the refund process could be a "mess."
Several countries have said they are studying the Supreme Court ruling and Trump's subsequent tariff announcements.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Saturday he would hold talks with European allies to formulate "a very clear European position" and joint response to Washington before he travels to the U.S. capital in early March.
On the domestic front, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said on X it was time for Trump to "listen to the Supreme Court, end chaotic tariffs, and stop wreaking havoc on our farmers, small business owners, and families."

Russian missile barrage hits energy, railways across Ukraine
Sign up now: Get insights on Asia's fast-moving developments
KYIV – Russia fired scores of missiles and drones at targets across Ukraine on Feb 22, crashing into energy and rail infrastructure and residential buildings, just two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion
AFP journalists in Kyiv heard a series of blasts starting at around 4am (10am Singapore time), shortly after an air raid alert was issued, with the air force later widening the alert warning nationwide, citing the threat of missiles.
“Moscow continues to invest in strikes more than in diplomacy,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky commented on the attack on social media, saying that Russia launched about 50 missiles and 300 drones overnight.
“The main target of the attack was the energy sector. Ordinary residential buildings were also damaged, and there is damage to the railway,” he said.
One man was killed and a dozen more people were wounded, among them four children, in and around Kyiv, Ukraine’s national police said.
Rescuers sifted through debris of a largely destroyed two-storey house in Sofiivska Borshchagivka in the Kyiv region.
Temperatures plunged to nearly minus 10 deg C when the capital was struck, with emergency services deployed across the city.
The Ukrainian capital, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since the start of the invasion on Feb 24, 2022
The Russian army said it carried out a mass strike targeting facilities used by Ukraine’s military, saying all targets were hit, in a standard comment for such attacks.
The authorities in Russia’s western Belgorod region said one man died after a Ukrainian drone strike.
‘Act of terrorism’
The bombardment, which included ballistic and cruise missiles, prompted heightened vigilance across Ukraine, all the way to the western border.
Ukraine’s Energy Ministry said consumers in six eastern and south-eastern region were without power after the strikes.
Poland’s Operational Command said early on Feb 22 it was scrambling jets after detecting “long‑range aviation of the Russian federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
In a separate attack, an explosion rocked a store in central Lviv, a western city near the Polish border far from the front line that is largely spared the worst of the conflict.
Explosions ripped through a central shopping street at around midnight, killing a policewoman and wounding 25 people after officers responded to a reported break‑in.
Hours later, law enforcement said it detained a Ukrainian woman suspected in carrying out the bomb attack, without providing any further details and saying that an investigation was ongoing.
“This is clearly an act of terrorism,” Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said, offering no details on perpetrators.
Ukraine ‘not losing’
Ukraine will mark four years since Russia’s assault on Feb 24, 2022, a war that has shattered towns, uprooted millions and killed large numbers on both sides.
Moscow occupies close to a fifth of Ukrainian territory and continues to grind forward in places, especially in the eastern Donbas region, despite heavy losses and repeated Ukrainian strikes on logistics.
Mr Zelensky said on Feb 20 that Ukraine was “definitely not losing” the war and that victory remained the goal.
He said Ukrainian forces had clawed back about 300sq km of territory in recent counter‑attacks, gains AFP could not immediately verify.
If confirmed, they would be Kyiv’s most significant advances since 2023.
Sweeping outages of Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front, shut down by owner Mr Elon Musk following a plea from Kyiv, have enabled the push, according to Mr Zelensky.
The United States is pushing both sides to end the war, brokering several rounds of talks since in recent weeks without a clear breakthrough.
Mr Zelensky, under mounting pressure from Washington to consider concessions, said on X on Feb 21 he planned consultations with European leaders in the coming days and wanted deeper involvement from Middle Eastern states and Turkey. AFP

Around 2,000 people marched in Paris on Saturday to show their support for Ukraine, police estimated, just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”.

“In public opinion, there is massive support for Ukraine that has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion” by the Russian army on Feb. 24, 2022, European Parliament member Raphael Glucksmann, told AFP.
“On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder and louder,” he added.
Police estimated around 2,000 people joined the demonstration.
Among those marching, Irina Kryvosheia, a Ukrainian who arrived in France several years ago, “thanked with all her heart the people present”.
A Personal Tribute to a Friend, Courageous Opponent of Soviet Political Abuses of Psychiatry
She said they reminded “everyone that what has been happening for four years is not normal, it is not right”.
Kryvosheia said she remained in daily contact with her parents in Kyiv, who told her how they were deprived “for several days” of heating, electricity, and running water following intense bombardments by the Russian army.
Francois Grunewald, head of the “Comité d’Aide Médicale Ukraine”, had just returned from a one-month mission in the country, during which the humanitarian organization had delivered around 40 generators since the beginning of the year.
Russia’s full-scale invasion sent shock waves around the world and triggered the bloodiest and most destructive conflict in Europe since World War II.
The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel on both sides. Millions of refugees have fled Ukraine, where vast areas have been devastated by fighting.
Russia occupies nearly 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, and its heavy attacks on the country’s energy sites have sparked a major energy crisis.

Pakistan launches deadly strikes in Afghanistan

Pakistan said Sunday it launched multiple air strikes targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
The overnight attacks were the most extensive since border clashes in October killed more than 70 people on both sides and wounded hundreds.
Islamabad said it hit seven sites along the border region targeting Afghanistan-based militant groups "in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan".
The military targeted the Pakistani Taliban and its associates, as well as an affiliate of the ISIL group, a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded" when strikes hit a madrasa and homes in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
An AFP journalist in Nangarhar's Bihsud district said residents from around the remote and mountainous area joined rescuers in one village, using a digger and shovels to search for bodies under the rubble.
"People here are ordinary people. The residents of this village are our relatives. When the bombing happened, one person who survived was shouting for help," said neighbour Amin Gul Amin, 37.
Nangarhar police told AFP the bombardment started at around midnight and hit three districts.
"Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out," said police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad.
'Calculated response'
Afghanistan's defense ministry said it will "deliver an appropriate and calculated response" to the Pakistani strikes.
The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.
Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians between October and December, according to the UN mission in Afghanistan.
Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.
The deteriorating relationship has hit people in both countries, with the land border largely shut for months.
Pakistan said Sunday that despite repeated urging by Islamabad, the Taliban authorities have failed to act against militant groups using Afghan territory to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
The Afghan government has denied harbouring militants.
Islamabad launched the strikes after a suicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other such attacks more recently in northwestern Pakistan.
The ISIL group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, which killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack in Islamabad since 2008.
The militant group's regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a Kabul restaurant last month.

In brief
- Burke said his department had received advice from ASIO that the group met the legal threshold to be banned.
- Established in 1953, Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamic political organisation with chapters around the world.
The federal government has begun the process of banning Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate group laws, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed.
Speaking on ABC's Insiders program on Sunday, Burke said his department had received advice from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation that the group met the legal threshold to be banned.
Under hate group laws introduced after the Bondi Beach terror attack, a new legal framework was established that allows the home affairs minister to ban groups found to be engaging in or advocating hate crimes based on race, nationality or ethnic origin.
Burke said his department would now prepare a briefing to satisfy him that the radical cleric group increased the risk of hate-motivated violence.
The opposition leader would then be briefed before the attorney-general signed off on the laws.
"This is the first time we have been able to ban, potentially, a group which falls short of a terrorist listing," he said.
"It says you don't have to be specifically calling for, but you do have to be acting in a way that increases the risk of communal violence or politically-motivated violence."
The federal government announced in December that the laws were intended to target "hate preachers". They named Hizb ut-Tahrir and the National Socialist Network, a neo-Nazi group that disbanded in January, as organisations it wanted banned.
Established in 1953, Hizb ut-Tahrir is an Islamic political organisation with chapters around the world. Its name translates to "Party of Liberation".
The organisation is banned in several countries, including in the United Kingdom, Germany, Egypt, Turkey, China and several countries in Central Asia.

Brazil's Lula calls for equality as Trump faces court tariff setback

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Sunday urged Donald Trump to treat all countries equally after the US leader imposed a 15 percent tariff on imports following an adverse Supreme Court ruling.
"I want to tell the US President Donald Trump that we don't want a new Cold War. We don't want interference in any other country, we want all countries to be treated equally," Lula told reporters in New Delhi.
The conservative-majority Supreme Court on Friday ruled six to three that a 1977 law Trump has relied on to slap sudden levies on individual countries, upending global trade, "does not authorise the President to impose tariffs".
Lula said he would not like to react to Supreme Court decisions of another country, but hoped that Brazil's relations with the United States "will go back to normalcy" soon.
The veteran leftist Brazilian leader is expected to travel to Washington next month for a meeting with Trump.
"I am convinced that Brazil-US relations will go back to normalcy after our conversation," Lula, 80, said, adding Brazil only wanted to "live in peace, generate jobs, and improve lives of our people".
Ties between Brazil and the United States appear to be on the mend after months of animosity between Washington and Brasilia.
As a result, Trump's administration has exempted key Brazilian exports from 40 percent tariffs imposed on the South American country last year.
"The world doesn't need more turbulence, it needs peace," said Lula, who arrived in India on Wednesday to attend a summit on artificial intelligence.
On Saturday, India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths and signed a raft of other deals after a meeting between Lula and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The heavy toll of the Iran mission on USS Gerald R Ford

One sailor missed the death of his great grandfather. Another is considering leaving the Navy after spending nearly a year away from her toddler daughter. Two others said problems were discovered in the ship's sewage system. Behind the geopolitical headlines surrounding the arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford in the Middle East lies a crew that has not seen home for months.
President Donald Trump decided to extend once again the deployment of the Ford's crew, a move that is exacting a steep personal price from sailors and their families. In interviews with The Wall Street Journal, some spoke of their longing for home and of milestones that will never be reclaimed.
The Ford, the largest warship in the US fleet, has been at sea since June last year. In October, the War Department redirected it from a planned Caribbean mission to the Middle East. The carrier had previously been part of the support infrastructure for a special operation aimed at capturing former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this year, the crew was informed that their deployment would be extended again and that they would be sent back to the Middle East in case a US airstrike against Iran is carried out.
In peacetime, aircraft carrier deployments typically last six months, with planners leaving several additional months of flexibility in case of unforeseen developments, retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery told the Journal. The USS Gerald R. Ford's sailors have already been away from home for eight months, and the deployment could stretch to 11 months. If that happens, it would break the US Navy's record for the longest continuous carrier deployment.
The US Navy operates 11 aircraft carriers, all functioning according to schedules planned long in advance. At any given time, some are deployed to different regions around the world, others are engaged in training and others are undergoing maintenance. In addition to the Ford, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group have also been dispatched to the Middle East.
One female sailor aboard the Ford told the Journal that many crew members feel anger and frustration, and some have said they intend to leave the service once the deployment ends. She herself is seriously considering doing so. She misses her daughter, but above all, she said, the uncertainty over when she will be able to return home is the most painful part.
Extended deployments can mean missing birthdays, weddings, funerals or even the birth of a child.
Not all members of the roughly 5,000 strong crew accept the sacrifice without reservation. Many of the sailors aboard the Ford are in their early twenties and miss their parents and home cooked meals. Others are parents themselves. They try to stay in touch through phone calls and WhatsApp messages, but the secrecy surrounding aircraft carrier movements means communication is often sporadic and unpredictable.
Some sailors see prolonged periods away from home as an integral part of military service. One told the Journal that although the extension was difficult and fatigue is evident throughout the ship, every sailor knew what they were signing up for when they enlisted. Their mission, he said, is to ensure that war does not reach the home front, and that sometimes requires long and demanding deployments.
If anyone feels the strain acutely, it is those left behind. Rozrin McGee, whose husband is serving aboard the Ford, said she has been alone for eight months while he remains at sea. Communication is sporadic and fragmented. She regularly sends him letters and small care packages containing snacks and items to remind him of the home awaiting his return. "When I heard that Donald Trump had decided to extend the crew's deployment, my heart broke," she said.
The Ford is the newest aircraft carrier in the US Navy and the first built in the Ford class. It entered service in 2022 and first saw operational activity when it sailed to the Mediterranean to help protect Israel following the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. Compared with the previous Nimitz class, Ford class carriers can sustain a much higher sortie rate, operate with a smaller crew and rely on significantly greater automation for launching and maintaining aircraft.
The Gerald R. Ford leads a task force that includes missile destroyers and cruisers capable of firing dozens of cruise missiles at targets hundreds of kilometers away and intercepting ballistic missiles, drones and cruise missiles with high precision. These ships could provide an additional layer of defense against Iran's missile capabilities.

According to Al Mayadeen, militants from the ISIL terrorist group carried out the attack in the northern outskirts of Raqqa province.
Before ISIL claimed responsibility, Syrian local media cited the country's Defense Ministry as saying that two individuals were killed in an attack by unidentified gunmen in the village of al-Wasita in northern Raqqa countryside.
ISIL later announced it was behind the assault.

Fact check: Are China's robot soldiers just AI fakes?
February 22, 2026A dozen humanoid robots stand in front of a snow-covered mountain range. They hold machine guns and run across a shooting range, kneeling down to shoot at targets and change magazines, then maneuvering through an obstacle course.
The setting for these scenes in a 48-second video currently circulating on social media is supposedly China, with the national flag flying in the background. But is it real?
Claim: "China has released a video of shooting drills involving Terminator-like robots," says a post on X that has been viewed 375,000 times. Another poststates: "China deployed 10,000+ robotic soldiers that will reduce the human cost if China-Taiwan war breakouts in 2027." Still other posts refer to the video as a "Unitree Robotics robot shooting test," including one on X with more than 1.5 million views. The video has been shared with similar claims in many other languages, including Arabic, French, Russian, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Georgian, and Vietnamese.
DW Fact Check: Fake
The robots in the video are based on the G1 model by Chinese company Unitree Robotics. But the scenes were clearly created using artificial intelligence. While some users have at least suggested that the video could be AI-generated, they have continued to post it with false claims.
Using a reverse image search of a still image from the video, DW Fact Check found a higher-resolution, slightly shorter version on YouTube that reveals more details. Frame-by-frame analysis revealed several AI-typical inconsistencies that could not have been created in the editing process.
- In the middle of the video, a robot reloads a magazine. Two seconds later, the magazine has disappeared without a trace under the rifle barrel.
- A person can be seen giving a shooting order while holding a radio in one hand. When he raises his hand, it merges with the device to form a single mass.
- Two cars in the background are deformed and appear to be fused together.
- A robot moves through a stack of sandbags like a ghost, without stepping over them.
- The lettering on the robot's chest disappears repeatedly and only partially resembles the company name "Unitree" where it typically appears on the real G1 model.
Philipp Cachee, an expert in forensic ballistics, also points out logical errors in the video. "There is no shell ejection in at least two places, and at 0:23, an empty magazine is loaded into the weapon," he said, concluding that it is "almost certainly" an AI-generated video.
The video is in fact labeled as such on on Bilibili, a video platform popular in China where it has also been uploaded.
Dancing robots
Unitree Robotics specializes in the development and production of four-legged and humanoid robots. DW contacted the company about the video, but these questions remained unanswered at the time of publication.
On its English website, the company states that it is known for its civilian robots. Unitree's social media profiles also highlight the complex movements its robots can now master, including dancing, martial arts, and moving through rough terrain.
The company was recently in the media after its robots performed a choreographed routine at a Chinese New Year gala, showing off somersaults and kung fu tricks.
While there has been no recent mention of weapons or military use on the company's profiles, that doesn't rule out the possibility that such tests could be underway. Nevertheless, the AI video being circulated does not portray a real exercise with Unitree robots.
A similar video makes a stir
Another video has also recently spread on social media worldwide, this time showing shooting exercises by humanoid robots, together with four-legged robots among ruined houses.
Claim: "ITS REAL!!! Chinese Unitree humanoids are now firing Type 191 Rifles!" claims a user on X, in a post viewed more than 680,000 times in less than a day. "Training kung fu robots to use weapons," writes another. In French, a Facebook user shared both videos at the same time, emphasizing that they are not AI. The video has also been shared in Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, and Korean — all without any reference to AI.
DW Fact Check: Fake
The video bears a watermark that leads back to the Bilibili platform, where it was posted by the same user who shared the first video with the note: "Tactical assault exercise by a Unitree robot squad, AI-generated, video content is for entertainment purposes only."
A close look at this video also shows inconsistencies that suggest AI. A target being shot at appears out of nowhere at 0:33, and at 0:38, one of the robots pulls a leg through the solid fence while jumping over it.
This video was edited before it was distributed on other networks. A logo and text elements were added to make it look like a television report by state channel CCTV Military. But the logo is missing characters.
The text added at the bottom of the video announces: "Expert analysis — Military report: New high-tech 'companions' in action! Visit to the tactical training ground for human-machine cooperation." While this may make sense, the text inserted on the video continues with a jumble of keywords, which is unusual for a real media report.
Robots join civic life
Even if these videos of shooting robots are AI-generated, China is still on the way to using humanoid robots in everyday life, including in the support security forces.
Just under a year ago, the state-run English-language Chinese broadcaster CGTN reported that a humanoid robot was patrolling the city of Shenzhen alongside police officers. In several major Chinese cities, such as Wuhan and Shanghai, such robots are already controlling traffic or being trained to do so.

ALBAWABA - Pakistan confirmed carrying out airstrikes on Afghanistan, targeting locations of Pakistani militants, which Islamabad blames for recent attacks inside the country, AP reported on Sunday.
Pakistan did not specify which areas the strikes were carried out in or provide any other details. However, Afghan reports said that the attacks hit the Ghani Khelo and Garda Samia districts inside Afghanistan, killing at least 17 civilians.
In addition, Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid revealed in a post on X that a strike was carried out by Pakistan, targeting civilians in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces. The Afghan official said that the attack led to the killing and injuring of dozens of people, including women and children.
In addition, Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said in a statement, "Continuing the previous aggressions, the Pakistani military regime has once again launched airstrikes on several civilian areas in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, targeting (a religious school and a number of civilian homes), resulting in the martyrdom and injury of dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children."
It added, "The Ministry of National Defense strongly condemns this flagrant violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty and this crime in the strongest terms, and considers it a clear breach of international laws and principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values..."

Homeland security to suspend TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues.
The programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for passengers.
The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said in a statement that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences”. She said also that “TSA and [Customs and Border Protection] CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts”.
The suspensions will begin from 6am ET on Sunday, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the development.
TSA’s PreCheck program allows approved passengers through a faster security lane at US airports and is designed to reduce wait times. Global Entry expedites US customs and immigration clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travelers entering the US.
Some US airlines were critical of DHS for giving travelers scant warning of the temporary suspension.
“Airlines for America is deeply concerned that ... the traveling public will be, once again, used as a political football amid another government shutdown,” said the chief executive for the trade association, Chris Sununu.
News of the suspensions came at “extremely short notice to travelers, giving them little time to plan accordingly,” he added, urging Congress to “get a deal done”.
A similar shutdown last year caused losses of $6.1bn across the travel industry and related sectors, he said.
The partial government shutdown began on 14 February after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the DHS. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.
Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.
They said on social media the administration was “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure” and accused them of “ruining your travel on purpose”.
On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a part of the DHS, to suspend the deployment of hundreds of aid workers to disaster-affected areas, due to the DHS shutdown.

Bleijie tells Labor to ‘cry me a river’ over social housing sales

Bleijie tells Labor to ‘cry me a river’ over social housing sales
Queensland’s second-most senior politician has told the opposition to “cry me a river” over its criticism of the government’s resumption of social housing sales.
Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie made the comments while opening submissions for a second $500 million round of his government’s fund for infrastructure to accelerate housing developments.
Earlier in the day, Opposition Leader Steven Miles held a media conference with housing spokesperson Meaghan Scanlon in which he said the sales were “taking Queensland backwards”.
Paused by Labor in 2022 amid criticism of the action during escalating demand, initial detail of the resumed sales was aired in parliamentary budget estimates last August.
As a result, the opposition asked Housing Minister Sam O’Connor a parliamentary question on notice about the expected proceeds – said by Miles on Sunday to be $119.3 million.
Scanlon added: “It defies logic that the Crisafulli government would sell off public housing in the middle of a crisis”.
Speaking to reporters at his media conference on Brisbane’s south, Bleijie hit back, noting that between 2015 and 2020, Housing Department sold an average of 280 social homes each year.
“So, cry me a river from the Labor Party, they can’t lecture people on the housing affordability … crisis we have in Queensland at the moment,” Bleijie said.
“Considering the two very people that got up this morning and spoke were the reason we have a Labor affordability and housing crisis in the first place.”
Bleiijie said the LNP was building four-times as many social and affordable homes as Labor, and since coming to power had overseen 5900 contracted or constructed – many by his government.
Median house prices in Brisbane jumped 13.3 per cent last year into second-place behind Sydney at $1.17 million, with another 11 per cent jump expected this year.
The median price for a unit, in which Brisbane has placed second for more than a year, jumped 19.3 per cent to more than $770,000 in December.
At the same time, median weekly rents in Brisbane saw some of the highest jumps in the year to December – also second to Sydney, alongside Perth at $650 per week for a unit.
Meanwhile, the number of people waiting for social housing across the state rose by almost 10,000 to 56,719 between September 2024 and June last year, despite a government crackdown.
While housing demand outpacing supply – for various reasons – is acknowledged by many as a key factor in housing price growth, tax breaks such as the capital gains concession are again in focus.
The government has pledged 1 million new homes by 2044, a figure Bleijie said on Sunday was “ahead of schedule”, while deriding social and affordability quotas as “red tape”.
O’Connor’s September response to the opposition question on notice said his department reviewed social homes it owned for those no longer cost-effective to own or at “the end of their useful life”.
Department-owned land “unsuitable to support social housing outcomes” was also considered for sale as part of this process “so it can be made available for broader housing supply”.
He said the last state budget featured $119.3 million as “cash inflow from the sale of non-financial assets”, in line with Labor’s budgets from 2022 and 2023, and forecast to continue going forward.
This was not linked to any expectation or target, with any proceeds reinvested to the department’s social and social and community housing capital program, O’Connor wrote.

Trump announces plan to send US hospital boat to Greenland, says sick are not being treated

US President Donald Trump on Saturday said he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send a hospital boat to Greenland.
Trump announced the plan on social media moments before hosting a dinner for Republican governors at the White House, where he sat next to and chatted with Landry.
"Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!" Trump said.
Neither the White House nor Landry's office responded to queries about the post, whether Denmark or Greenland had requested the ship and which sick people needed help. The Department of War had no immediate comment.
Danish King Frederik paid a second visit to Greenland in a year last week, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory amid Trump's push to buy the island.
Greenland hospital ship plan lacks official confirmation
Greenland, Denmark and the US late last month held talks to resolve the situation following months of tensions within the NATO defense alliance.
Trump's post came hours after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine in Greenland's waters, seven nautical miles outside of Greenland's capital, Nuuk.
It was unclear what connection Landry had with the matter or if the post had any connection to the evacuation.
The US Navy has two hospital ships, the Mercy and the Comfort, but neither are stationed in Louisiana.

Australian navy ship crosses strategic Taiwan Strait, drawing Chinese military response

An Australian warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait, a government source said on Sunday in the latest transit of the sensitive waterway by a US ally, which Chinese state-backed media said was tracked and monitored by the nation's military.
In addition to claiming sovereignty over democratically governed Taiwan, Beijing views the narrow, highly strategic strait as Chinese territorial waters and has responded aggressively on occasion to foreign navies sailing there.
The Toowoomba, an Anzac-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy, "conducted a routine transit through the Taiwan Strait" on Friday and Saturday as part of a "Regional Presence Deployment in the Indo-Pacific region," the source said.
"All interactions with foreign ships and aircraft were safe and professional," the source said.
China's state-backed Global Times newspaper, citing an unnamed Chinese military source, reported late on Saturday that "the Chinese People's Liberation Army carried out full-process tracking, monitoring, and alert operations throughout the transit."
Taiwan Strait transit by Australian ship draws China response
US warships traverse the strait every few months, enraging Beijing, and some US allies, such as France, Australia, Britain, and Canada, have also made occasional transits.
China has ramped up its military presence around Taiwan and staged its latest war games around the island in late December.
Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.

Israel's bobsled team has been suspended from the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina after an attempted unauthorized substitution of one of its athletes, the Olympic Committee of Israel announced.
The decision came after team members sought to replace a competitor in an apparent bid to improve their standing in the rankings. Under Olympic regulations, substitutions are permitted only in cases of injury or illness.
According to details released by the committee, one of the athletes reported feeling unwell, was examined by a doctor and signed a medical affidavit, enabling the Olympic Committee of Israel to submit a formal request to approve the change.
However, the athlete later admitted to the head of the Israeli delegation that he had not been ill and that the move had been improper. Following the confession, the committee rejected the substitution request and decided to suspend the entire team from further participation in the Games.
In a statement, the Olympic Committee of Israel said it had received information Saturday evening that members of the bobsled team had sought to replace one of the participants "in an improper manner that does not meet the standards expected of Olympic athletes and is not aligned with Olympic values."
"As a result, a decision was made not to allow the bobsled team to compete in the event," the statement said.

The Ministry of Defense of Afghanistan’s Taliban-led administration stated that the country will respond “at the appropriate time” to recent Pakistani airstrikes, which it says hit civilian areas.
In a statement reported by Al Jazeera, the ministry said Pakistani aircraft carried out air raids in the provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, resulting in dozens of casualties.
The statement strongly condemned what it described as violations of Afghan airspace, calling them breaches of international law and principles of good neighborly relations.
The Taliban authorities held the Pakistani military responsible for allegedly targeting civilians and religious centers, warning that they would respond with an “appropriate and measured” reaction at a time of their choosing.
Taliban officials in Kabul rejected Islamabad’s claims that the strikes targeted bases of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Reports indicate that a religious school in Paktika province was struck during the latest air operation.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s information minister said the strikes targeted camps and hideouts belonging to the TTP and ISIL near the Afghan border.

The data published on the Education Ministry's website leaves no room for doubt. A majority of the Jewish children studying in Israeli elementary schools today are either religious Zionists or ultra-Orthodox. This trend is clear and unequivocal. The secular community's great days as a majority have passed; it is marching inexorably down the slope of the graph toward a new reality in which it becomes a minority.

More than 1,500 detainees seek release under Venezuela’s new amnesty law
Law excludes serious crimes, signals shift after years of official denials that political prisoners existed
ISTANBUL
More than 1,500 people in Venezuela detained for political reasons have filed for amnesty under a newly enacted law and are slated for release, authorities announced Saturday.
"As of yesterday, there were 405 applications from people deprived of liberty. Today, an additional 1,152 applications were received, bringing the total to 1,557. These are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of people deprived of liberty are already being released under the amnesty law," said National Assembly leader Jorge Rodriguez.
The measure approved Thursday is expected to benefit opposition members, activists, journalists and others. Its passage marks a shift by authorities, who have long denied holding political prisoners, and comes after last month’s US military raid in Caracas that captured President Nicolas Maduro.
The legislation does not apply to individuals convicted of homicide, drug trafficking, grave human rights abuses or military rebellion.
Rights groups have urged authorities to extend the measure to all those detained for political reasons, regardless of whether they are formally included.
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, head of Foro Penal, wrote Saturday on US social media platform X, adding that without measure, “there can be no talk of national coexistence.”
Rodriguez added that the law also applies to people who had been under alternative detention arrangements, such as reporting requirements or house arrest, and “the law provides for these alternative measures to be lifted so that individuals can enjoy full freedom.”
He noted that “authorities are processing the requests of more than 11,000 people who were under alternative detention regimes within the justice system, and those 11,000 individuals will be reviewed by the Dennis Law monitoring committee.”
Acting President Delcy Rodriguez described the measure during the bill’s signing as evidence that the nation’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”

‘The anxieties just lift’: why domestic abuse refuges are turning to female tradespeople
Unknown

06:00:31 UTC
15:00:31 KST

One of the main challenges in maintaining the 64 homes for domestic abuse survivors run by Refuge is the reliance on a male-dominated workforce of electricians, plumbers and decorators.
“The presence of men can be distressing and could trigger past traumas for our survivors,” said Lisa Cantwell-Hope, the head of property services at the charity. “Male contractors need an escort to make our survivors feel more comfortable, and we always put a notice out to all our residents saying there will be a male presence in the building today. So it can be challenging and takes up more time.”
Data from the Office for National Statistics shows there were 48,000 tradeswomen in the UK in 2021, a growth of 41% from 2006, but it is thought this is still only about 4% of the total trades workforce, and construction is consistently ranked as the most male-dominated industry in the country.
Regionally, the West Midlands has the highest number of tradeswomen (who make up 4.4% of all tradespeople, above London (2.98%) and the south-west (2.24%). In the East Midlands, north-east, Northern Ireland, Scotland, south-east and Wales, they make up less than 1% of tradespeople, according to 2023 data from My Local Toolbox.
But there are clear signs that things are shifting and women are increasingly moving into the sector – the number of women taking construction and engineering apprenticeships rose by 73% between 2019 and 2022.
This is welcome news for domestic abuse charities such as Refuge, which are slowly starting to shift from handymen to handywomen.
“If we could just use female contractors, I’d be a happy woman, but there isn’t enough currently,” said Cantwell-Hope. “But having them makes our jobs a lot easier, and it makes it easier to get people in the refuges, because there’s that common understanding of the sensitivity. They say they feel much more relaxed having a female in the property.
“We’ve got to remember our refuges are people’s homes, and as much as we need to maintain the building, we also have to make it therapeutically pleasing and comfortable.”
The charity is working with TaskHer, an online directory of tradeswoman, to source female workers. The service was set up by Anna Moynihan and her husband in 2021, due to the difficulty in finding tradeswomen when renovating their home.
“I found that every time a tradesperson came to our house, they were a man and they would always speak to my husband and not me,” said Moynihan. “It was really frustrating.”
After doing some research, they found there was huge unmet demand from consumers for tradeswomen – particularly from single women living alone, the LGBT community and women who for religious reasons did not want men in their home.
They then started getting inquiries from domestic abuse charities. “We realised that they were having essentially the same issues that we had from a personal perspective, but on a larger scale,” said Moynihan. “It wasn’t necessarily about convenience, it was about creating an environment that the women who are living in their refuges would still feel safe in.”
They’re now working with Refuge, and other domestic abuse charities, to supply female workers in London, with an aim to expanding outside the capital in the near future.
Erin, a 26-year-old electrician in London, has been working with Refuge for the past few months doing everything from odd jobs to replacing consumer units in their safe houses.
She said taking on the job was a no-brainer as it is rewarding to be able to put her skills to good use in a scenario where a tradesman might cause some apprehension.
“If you can make anyone feel more comfortable in a situation, why wouldn’t you want to do that anyway?” she said. “You can feel it in the air, the anxieties just lift slightly when you go in and they can see who you are.”
She said she’s met very few fellow tradeswomen in her work, although numbers have started to increase in recent years. “I was the only girl on my course at the time and I don’t think they had another one for at least a couple years after that,” she said. “Every day on the job and going around different sites, I never encountered any tradeswomen, never mind an electrician.”
She also said there’s still a degree of sexism she encounters when doing jobs. “You get the older gents watching over and making sure you’re doing it right. I’ve got a baby face and I’m only five foot two so that doesn’t help things,” she said. “But it does feel like things are starting to change. I know a fair few female gas engineers now as well as plumbers, and painters and decorators.”

Matt Goodwin is running: the search for Reform’s elusive byelection candidate

On a bracingly cold February night in Levenshulme, a black Volkswagen people-carrier draws up outside a little parish church, around which a small crowd has begun to gather. From behind the car’s darkened windows steps the Reform candidate for the Gorton and Denton byelection, dressed in the trademark gilet that makes him look less like a politician and more like a man who has come straight from a grouse shoot. As he enters the church where the electoral hustings will take place, a leaflet is thrust into his hand, which as he will later discover with a horrified grimace, is a flyer for the local branch of the Communist League, bearing policies such as “amnesty for all immigrants” and “defend Cuba’s socialist revolution”.
But then, when you are trying to attract the attention of someone as elusive as Prof Matt Goodwin, you have to seize your opportunities whenever they arise. Over recent weeks the former academic and rightwing firebrand has been a curiously intangible presence in the constituency whose representation he is seeking: perpetually detectable but not remotely approachable, always visible without ever really being seen.
None of the dozens of voters I spoke to across the area over the course of two weeks in February had actually glimpsed him in the flesh, much less seen him on their street or doorstep. “He’s probably chilling in St Albans,” jokes one young man crossing the Stockport Road in Denton, a pointed reference to Goodwin’s southern upbringing and unmistakable home counties vowels.
This is not quite true. By his own account, Goodwin has been out campaigning every single day since his candidacy was announced in late January, although this in itself is a term freighted with ambiguity. To a large extent, this is a campaign conducted for the benefit of the internet: consisting of a handful of carefully curated media appearances, arranged meetings and brief photo opportunities. A black car rolls up alongside a pub or a row of terrace houses; its cargo emerges; photographs are taken; content is captured. By the time it is posted, the candidate has long since been ferried away in his transport, presumably back to the safety of Reform’s headquarters, a corrugated iron hulk on an industrial estate just off the M67.
Then again, given the toxic fallout on both sides of the political divide that Goodwin’s campaign has engendered, perhaps a certain caution is only to be expected. Even by the melodramatic standards of the classic British byelection, this has been an unusually feverish month, beset by controversy and fury. There have been accusations on all sides of phantom polls and pretend numbers, dirty tricks and disinformation. A member of Goodwin’s team, Adam Mitula, has reportedly been suspended for racist social media posts in which he claimed he “wouldn’t touch a Jewish woman” and disputed the true death toll of the Holocaust. There were accusations made on social media – comprehensively debunked by FullFact – that Reform had doctored photos to add posters in house windows. The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has given Goodwin his personal endorsement.
And so who can blame Reform’s buoyant and ever-alert operation from wanting to put as much distance between their candidate and any potentially awkward questions as humanly possible? Requests to interview him, or simply accompany him while he goes out canvassing, have been flatly denied. A terse security guard shoos us away from campaign HQ, reminding us that “everything to the end of the car park is private land”. Earlier this month Goodwin was withdrawn from a hustings in Gorton on the basis that it would not have provided an impartial environment. Other candidates have said that it was because the venue was unable to provide him with a private green room.
For a supposedly proud free-speech warrior, a man who has always readily embraced the adversarial side of politics, who says what he says and seems singularly unbothered by who he offends in the process, it all feels a touch incongruous. Goodwin has a huge Substack following, a significant media imprint and enough money not to need an MP’s salary. Why is a man with his own GB News show and a huge public platform concerning himself with bin collections and bus provisions in a place he had barely visited before January? What exactly are the voters of Gorton and Denton preparing to unleash on this country? In short: what’s the long game here?
Gorton and Denton is really about seven places in one: a jagged dinosaur’s tooth of a constituency, inelegantly redrawn in 2023, stretching from the slowly gentrifying south Manchester suburbs to the post-industrial villages and small towns of Tameside to the east. Some of it is lovely and some of it is grim. No single message, no single campaign can ever hope to appeal to the whole. In a way it is a perfect microcosm of modern Britain, fractured and dislocated from itself, separated by motorways and algorithms.
I sit in pubs and cafes and libraries and supermarkets and have countless conversations. There is no great enthusiasm for Reform in these parts, and even less for Goodwin himself. Nigel Farage is variously described as “a chancer”, “a smooth talker”, “a snake-oil salesman”, “full of shit”. But people intend to vote for his candidate nonetheless because – and this is something that also comes up again and again – they need to be “given a go”. Everyone else has fucked-up, and now it’s their turn.
There’s a bit of the basic, ill-informed racism that sounds parodic until you actually hear it come out of a real person’s mouth. We work hard; they come over here to take because of the benefits. My son can’t buy a house; they get houses for free. And by the way, if you’re hungry later there’s a cracking Chinese restaurant up the road. (This was a real conversation, and the guy was genuinely lovely. He bought me two pints of Cruzcampo, showed me his holiday photos and asked whether I was any good at paper folding.)
Insofar as anyone has heard of Goodwin, it’s because of his GB News show, which often plays in pubs with the sound down. Nobody can recall anything he’s actually said, whether it’s about fines for wearing the burqa in public places or penalising childless women through the tax system. Which, evidently enough, is a problem for anyone attempting to campaign against him. How do you counter a narrative that people can’t remember? How do you rebut a vibe?
“When I hear something racist or xenophobic, I will challenge it,” says Hannah Spencer, the Green party candidate. “But there’s a huge group of people considering Reform who aren’t racist, who often don’t fully understand what Reform are like. They don’t know what Matt Goodwin has been saying. When I’ve told people what he says about Muslims, what he says about women, people are really shocked. So maybe what we know about him, people don’t yet know about him.”
When asked previously about his past comments on Islam, Goodwin said: “What you’ll find in places like Longsight and Burnage is Muslim voters who are often quite socially and culturally conservative and agree with us on issues like open borders, legalisation of drugs, men going into women’s spaces, antisocial behaviour.”
One of the Greens’ main attack lines on the doorstep is that Goodwin isn’t really from Manchester. How does this square with the idea that this is a city for everyone, enriched for centuries by outsiders making it their home? “You don’t have to be from here to be one of us,” Spencer replies. “I really wholeheartedly believe that. However, I don’t believe he’s interested in wanting to make this area better. I think he’s just doing it because it’s a step on his career ladder. He wants the status and the attention and the ego.”
Goodwin is bristling. “I’m sorry, why would I want you to leave the country?” he asks, unhappy with the direction the conversation has taken. “When has anybody ever said anything like that?”
We’re back in Levenshulme, a few minutes before the start of the hustings, and there is precious little time for small talk. Goodwin has said in the past that Englishness is an “ethnicity deeply rooted in people that can trace their roots back over generations”. He has said that people from minority ethnic backgrounds, even if they were born here, are not necessarily British. Farage has already unveiled plans to deport up to 600,000 migrants in the first term of a Reform government. “Remigration” – a fancy term for the “send them back” motif that has defined far-right rhetoric for decades – is back on the political agenda. Do they mean me? Who is them? Where is back?
“I’m not sure you’ve looked at Reform policy in detail,” Goodwin says. “What I’ve said with regards to things like 7/7 and the Manchester bombings, is that if you come to Britain and you decide to blow up our children, you are rejecting membership of our community. Now, based on knowing you for one minute, you seem to be somebody who’s not … running around blowing up your fellow citizens.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” I respond.
“You seem to be working hard, probably paying taxes and probably following the rules. So I have nothing but support for people who do that. If you’re here illegally, you will be deported.”
The problem is that “legal” and “illegal” are extremely malleable terms, defined above all by the government and the polity of the day. My parents came here perfectly legally in the 1970s, but what if a future regime fixated on the evils of multiculturalism, determined to roll back mass immigration, decides that it wasn’t actually legal at all? “What I don’t understand,” I say, “is that you roll it back and roll it back. At what point do you say: OK, we’ve got our culture back? At what point is it enough?”
“Personally, I think we should do what America did after the 1920s and Ellis Island,” he replies. “America paused all immigration for 40 years. I think we should pause migration with the exception of a very small amount that is essential for some public services. And then we need to bring back a very limited amount of migration, something comparable to what we had in the 1980s, 1990s, before Tony Blair.”
But of course we had social unrest and racial tension in the 1920s, in the 1950s, in the 1960s, in the 1980s. Does he really think this was a better, more harmonious country in the 1980s?
“There’s been some disturbances,” Goodwin says disdainfully. “But nothing compared to what we’ve had over the last 25 years. 7/7, Manchester Arena, British Jews being murdered on the streets of Manchester. I mean, how much of this are you willing to tolerate? This is the problem with the left. The endless catastrophising. At no point did I say I wanted to return to the 1980s and 1990s. At no point did I talk about throwing communities out. And I’d appreciate a very fair write-up of this interview, otherwise Reform’s press officer will be in touch.”
As he leaves, doubtless elated at having owned another lib, I finally realise why Goodwin has entered the rat race. Over the course of the subsequent two hours at the hustings, his eyes will frequently glaze and droop as a succession of parishioners raise their concerns over air quality, fly-tipping, traffic gridlock. What really appears to animate him is the cut and thrust of the culture wars, the end-of-civilisations stuff, politics as a vessel for race debate, the parliamentary byelection reimagined along the lines of the YouTube comments thread.
In essence this is the very substance of the rightwing strategy: politicians feign enough of an interest in what voters care about so they can get on with what they care about. Gorton and Denton goes to the polls on Thursday. What does Matt Goodwin really think? By the time we find out, it may be too late.

‘We are not scared’: the Ukrainians building families in the shadow of war

Four years ago Russian troops were a few kilometres away from Leleka maternity hospital, beyond a pine forest and a lake. Vladimir Putin’s plan to conquer Ukraine – wrapping it into a new Russian empire – began just down the road. His forces were meant to seize Kyiv and topple Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s pro-western government.
To the Kremlin’s surprise, Ukraine fought back. A Russian armoured column was destroyed in nearby Bucha. For five weeks a battle raged. Maternity staff treated wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Then, in March 2022, Russian troops pulled out of the Kyiv region. They left behind the bodies of hundreds of civilians they had killed, including fleeing families gunned down in their cars.
The hospital in the snowy health resort of Pushcha-Vodytsia has since returned to its original function: delivering babies. The war grinds on as Putin seemingly looks to the White House and Donald Trump to deliver a victory that has been elusive on the battlefield.
In eastern Ukraine, Russia continues to slowly push forward, but there is a price: in January, 35,000 of its soldiers were killed or wounded.
Moscow’s army now occupies 20% of the country, including Crimea. It has taken 1.2 million dead and wounded for it to advance 30 miles in the Donbas region, about the same number of casualties that the US suffered during the entire second world war.
“I don’t believe Ukraine will lose, ultimately. This is my internal feeling. Russia won’t defeat us,” said Valeriia Ivashchenko, who gave birth at the clinic. “So many people have lost friends and loved ones. There’s been so much destruction. It’s taken a toll on both countries. Ukraine won’t stop existing. Our life can’t be called normal, but we try to adapt.”
Ivashchenko was visiting the hospital with her 20-month-old daughter, Veronica, one of a new generation of Ukrainian children born during the conflict. In 2022, Russian shells damaged her family’s apartment building in the village of Horenka. Now enemy drones and ballistic missiles can be heard buzzing above their home, en route to the capital.
“It’s scary. You don’t know their direction. We hide at home between two walls. Veronica recognises the air-raid sirens,” Ivashchenko said. “When the invasion began, I didn’t have a kid. I want to continue to build our life here. War means you can only plan for the short or medium term.”
According to the UN refugee agency, 5.9 million Ukrainians have fled the country, and 3.7 million have been internally displaced. Many are women with children. After four years of all-out war, Ukraine has one of the lowest birthrates in the world, with about one birth for every three deaths. The hospital’s own figures illustrate the country’s stark demographic crisis. In 2020, there were 2,300 deliveries. In 2022, it was 868, and last year, 952.
Dr Valerii Zukin, Leleka’s chief executive, described the fall in numbers as “very sad for me”.
“I like the atmosphere in maternity clinics. It’s different from in a regular hospital, where there is pain and tragedy. Here, people come with positive emotions,” he said, adding: “We must learn to live and survive in these conditions. As Ernest Hemingway wrote: ‘It is silly not to hope.’”
Another mother, Ivanna Didur, said her growing family had decided to stay in Kyiv. In October 2025 she gave birth to her third child, Anastasia. “We are not leaving unless Russia is going to be on the doorstep,” she said. She described having a baby in wartime as a “patriotic act”. “I feel I owe it to people on the frontline to stay, raise kids and tell them about Ukraine,” she said.
Ukraine’s low birthrate was in line with European trends, she added. On top of that, many Ukrainians were struggling financially and felt they “could not afford” to have children. Now there is also a lack of security. Ivanna said she had taped up the windows on her son and daughters’ bedrooms, to protect them from flying glass.
She and her husband, Anatolii, try to give their children as normal a life as possible. Their eight-year-old, Anna, does acrobatics, while Andrii – five – plays football and attends scouts. They eat pizza and go to the cinema. The couple have bought power banks, so their flat stays warm during blackouts caused by bombing. “I don’t think Ukraine is losing. In Donbas the Russians are taking micro-steps,” she said.
Before the war, Ukraine’s population was 41 million. The estimated figure today is between 30 million and 32 million, excluding citizens living under Russian occupation. Kyrylo Ventskivsky, the former head of obstetrics at the Kyiv perinatal centre, said the demographic story was “complicated”. “Overall, the birthrate has decreased by maybe 30%. At the same time, some pregnant women who went abroad come back,” he said.
One of his patients recently returned from the US to Kyiv, where basic maternity services are free. “She estimated she could buy a studio apartment in the suburbs with the $30,000-$40,000 it would take to give birth in America,” he said.
One law exempts fathers with three children from fighting and allows them to leave the country. “Some women tell me they have a third child for this reason,” the doctor acknowledged.
If the low birthrate continues, demographers predict that by 2050 only 25 million people will live in Ukraine. The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament, has taken steps to address this alarming decline. In January it increased a one-off payment given to new mothers to 50,000 hryvnia (£858). It also introduced a new monthly subsidy of 7,000 hryvnia for pregnant women without a job.
Ventskivsky described himself as an optimist. “As a society we are changing. People are fighting, donating and trying to make things better ,” he said, predicting refugees would return in the event of peace. He added: “If there were no corruption, we could be a phenomenal country. We have sea, mountains, good food and great beer.”
For parents who have gone abroad, life can be tough. Ivashchenko said a lot of her friends who had left Ukraine “were struggling”. “It’s hard to adapt. You are considered a refugee and don’t have the same social status as at home. Here we have family, friends and a circle. There you have to start from scratch. It’s hard enough to have a child under normal conditions,” she said.
Ivashchenko said the outcome of the war in Ukraine would determine Europe’s future and the kind of world her daughter grew up in. “I don’t consider it to be a Russian-Ukrainian conflict. I think this is an attack on the whole liberal democratic system and on western values. The idea we live in a world based on rules and international law is an illusion. It doesn’t work any more,” she said.
Few believe the Russians intend to stop their bloody 12-year attempt to destroy Ukraine. “The invasion was a dumb thing to do. They are blinded by their own propaganda and lies,” Ivashchenko said. “The war has made Ukraine more united. We became more proud of our Ukrainian identity. And we are brave. A lot of nations are scared of Russians. We are not scared.”

‘She did kill. There’s no grey area there’: Labour MP Naz Shah on the day she and her mother were arrested for murder

Naz Shah found it thrilling when she was arrested on suspicion of murder. “I’ll be honest with you, I had fun. It was the most excitement I’d ever had in my flipping life. I’d never been to a police station before. I was 18 and wet behind the ears. I was this really sheltered kid who’d been arrested. And I was like, they’ve got it wrong, so in my head it was all going to be over soon,” the MP for Bradford West says. “They took my clothes and gave me this white suit to wear, and I was saying, ‘Ooh, I look foxy in this, don’t I? Can you imagine taking me on a date in this?’ I was having a right laugh with the police officers. Honestly, I was so naive.”
Shah’s beloved “Uncle” Azam had died unexpectedly in April 1992. An autopsy revealed that he had been poisoned with arsenic. Shah and her mother, Zoora, who spoke little English, had cooked the previous night’s supper. They were arrested and taken to different police stations. Shah was released. Zoora admitted that she had made the dessert that contained the arsenic. After a month-long trial, she was convicted of Azam’s murder in December 1993 and sentenced to 20 years in jail.
The excitement Shah had felt at the police station didn’t last long. She tried to kill herself twice following her mother’s conviction. But she is one of life’s great survivors. Despite leaving school at 12, being forced into an arranged marriage at 15, and having to bring up her two younger siblings after her mother was jailed, she became a celebrated campaigner, held down high-powered jobs and has been a member of parliament for 11 years. “It’s an interesting life I’ve had,” she says.
Over the next couple of hours, I discover Shah has a fine line in understatement. She was six when her wife-beating, heroin-dealing father traded in her mother for a younger model, and the shame it brought on the family led indirectly to her mother’s conviction.
Shah’s story has always been central to her relationship with the community. Before running against George Galloway in Bradford West in 2015, she published a blog about her family’s history: if she didn’t own her story, it was ripe for exploitation. But then she was telling it as a campaigner who had fought for her mother. Now she’s telling it in a profoundly personal way, as someone who lived through those horrors and was shaped by them.
Her memoir is called Honoured because she is honoured to be an MP, to have survived it all, and at its heart is the Islamic concept of izzat, Arabic for honour. But the book is as much about its bleak antithesis – dishonour. In her culture, a family without izzat is worthless. The day her father walked out, they lost it – and her mother’s attempt to regain it had terrible repercussions.
We’re at her Bradford home, a lovely stone cottage. There’s a fire roaring, her cat Ruby is juggling a couple of sticks and Shah is making us a cup of tea. I’ve arrived early and she’s not quite ready. “Give me a few minutes. D’you want some fruit? Should I put the telly on for you? Make yourself at home.” I sit marvelling at Ruby’s dexterity and at how Shah turned her life around.
Soon she’s back, fully made up, pack of fags in hand. “D’you mind if I smoke? When the kids are here, I can’t smoke in the house.” Shah has three children with her second husband, from whom she is now separated. He lives close by and they have a good relationship.
I ask how she’s feeling about the book. “I bumped into Sadiq Khan the other day,” she says. The London mayor and former Labour MP is a friend, and she gave him a proof to read. “Sadiq said, ‘That was traumatic’ and put his hand on his chest. I said, ‘Nah, you’re good!’ And he said, ‘No, Naz, it was traumatic reading that.’” What did she say then? “I went, yeah.” She might have as much front as the Pennines, but nobody understands what she and her family went through better than her.
Shah, 52, started the book in 2017 – then put it aside for six years: “I had healing to do, and writing it brought up a lot of issues.” Two years ago she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. In the end, she says, she had to write it to get everything out of her system and show people you can get through the hardest of times. “It’s not a misery memoir,” she says pugnaciously. “I’m sat here in my own home with the fire on. To have a fire on and not think about the token you’ve got to buy to put your electricity on and leave a light on, these are things you can’t take for granted. To have got to where I’ve got to, it’s in strength, not weakness.” Shah is short and slight, but she’s made of tough stuff.
“My fight started in the womb. I mean, because I was born a girl, my father didn’t pick me up till he had a son.” Shah’s father was so disappointed, he wouldn’t look at her for the first year of her life. Zoora immediately got pregnant again and gave birth to a boy who died within hours. Shah’s maternal uncle told her father this was God’s way of telling him he should treasure her. So he did. For a while. He would lift her on to the TV, twirling her around to Boney M’s Brown Girl in the Ring. She adored him. Back then her father was a regular businessman, doing well for himself. They were the only family in the street with a colour telly and video recorder. Then one day, when she was five, she saw him drag her mother by her hair and assault her. “I ran up two sets of stairs to the neighbours and was banging on their door to come and stop him.” It wasn’t the only time she witnessed his violence towards her mother. But she told herself this was an aberration, that he was a good man, and continued to love him.
Then he walked away, leaving the family destitute. By now, Shah had a sister, Foz, and brother, Imy. There had been rumours her father was having an affair with a neighbour. It wasn’t true: he was having a relationship with her 16-year-old daughter, whom he went on to marry. And that’s when izzat came into play. Shah was told she was dishonoured because her father had left home. Zoora, still only 24 and working part-time as a cleaner, was determined to restore izzat to the family and thought she could do this by selling her wedding jewellery to put a deposit down on a £10,000 house. But without a full-time job, she couldn’t get a mortgage.
This is when Uncle Azam came into the story. He was neither a real uncle nor a real friend. But he appeared to be both. “He brought fruit over for us, so he seemed like a knight in shining armour. But he was exploiting a vulnerable young woman.” Another understatement. Azam, who was married, told Zoora he would register the house in his name, she would make payments via him, and when she had paid off the mortgage he would transfer the property to her. But it didn’t work out that way. The first time he took Zoora to her new home, he raped her. And so it continued. When he went to prison for heroin dealing, his criminal associates started to come to the house with provisions for the family. Zoora took them upstairs out of sight while the children did their homework. When she came back down, she looked distraught. Sometimes she was bruised.
At 12, Shah was sent to live with relatives in Pakistan. “I thought I was going for a holiday. I didn’t come back for two and a half years, and I never saw the inside of a school again. They didn’t let me come back till I had my nikah done [a marriage contract in Islamic law].” The relatives told her Zoora had approved the marriage, even though she hadn’t. At 16, Shah’s husband joined her in Bradford. He was immature, abusive and controlling. Six months later, she walked out on him.
The teenager briefly took back control of her life. And then Azam died. In her eyes, he was still a good man. But when her mother was remanded in jail, rumours grew that she had killed Azam because he had been abusing Shah. This left her even more devastated. She knew she hadn’t been abused by him, and was convinced her mother, who pleaded not guilty, hadn’t killed him. Shah felt humiliated and lost. She took an overdose, and had her stomach pumped. “We’d just been arrested and were on the front page of a local rag, and it was overwhelming and I wanted out.” She pauses. “Looking back, I think that was probably a cry for help.”
She was 20 when her mother was finally tried. Shah sat through every day of the month-long trial, and can still see the verdict being delivered in Technicolor. “Her right hand was on her mouth, as if she was trying not to scream, and the other was grasping the rail in front of her. Her eyes were locked on mine. It’s like she was trying to hold me tight. And that kills me, even today.” Shah gulps. When she was doing the audiobook, this was one of a few parts she simply couldn’t read out.
There are so many memories she struggles with. At 20, she found herself homeless, sofa surfing wherever she could. After Azam’s death, 11-year-old Foz had been sent to Pakistan. In 1993, with their mother remanded in jail, Shah sent Imy to bring Foz home, but without the money for a return flight, they got stuck there. She was now alone. “I was in a crack den at one point; I can still smell that horrible, sweet, sickly smell.” Then there was her first Eid alone: “My cousin Pini rang me and it hit me my sister wasn’t there, my brother wasn’t there, my mother was locked up, and I just felt overwhelmed.”
That was the second time she attempted suicide. This time it was for real. “I had nothing but the clothes on my back. I was homeless, I didn’t have a job, and I didn’t want to live.” How did she feel when she came round? “Numb. I’d had my stomach pumped again. I was in a mental health crisis.” Had she come close to killing herself? “Very close. Had I not been found, I think I’d have died. Nobody’s asked me that question.” She sounds remote. “I was out for days. When I came round, my mum rang. She cried and I cried. I thought, what the fuck was I doing, because I was her only hope. I felt guilty. She was like, ‘If you go, what’s left for me?’”
That was the last time she contemplated suicide. She now had a purpose in life: to fight for justice for her mother. Of course, Zoora was innocent. There was no way she could kill anybody, let alone a good man like Uncle Azam. Imy and Foz finally got home, and the three moved into a council flat. Shah made connections with campaigning groups, lawyers and miscarriage of justice experts. Zoora had still never said what she knew about Azam’s death. But she began to talk to Pragna Patel from Southall Black Sisters, and in 1995 told her exactly what had happened. She said Azam had raped her repeatedly and when he was in prison he had sent his friends to rape her. When she told him she was going to expose the truth, he threatened something even worse. “He told Mum, ‘Remember the grass is always greener with that daughter of yours.’ I realised she had sent me to Pakistan to keep me from his clutches.”
Until that day, she had insisted on her mother’s innocence. “Pragna sat me and Foz down and said, ‘You know your mum killed him, girls. She has admitted it.’” Did she still regard Zoora as a victim of a miscarriage of justice? “She served 14 years for killing someone who was destroying her and threatening her daughter. But she did kill somebody. There’s no grey area there. The grey area is she was a woman who was destitute and driven to kill the man who had abused her for years.”
Another Technicolor memory. Shah is driving on the M606 with Foz and Imy. By now Shah and Foz have known for months that their mother was abused by Azam, but they haven’t told Imy. Shah decides the time is right – because she’s driving, it will moderate his response. “I will never forget the sound of his fist on that windscreen. I was shocked it didn’t smash. I said, ‘Mum killed Azam because she was abused and she had forced abortions.’ My sister was bawling, I was crying, and he had broken down.” Did he punch the windscreen because she had killed Azam or because she’d been abused? “Because she’d been abused. That was so painful for him; that our mother had suffered so much.”
Southall Black Sisters helped the family to appeal against the length of the sentence. The Guardian’s crime reporter Duncan Campbell was the first national newspaper journalist to cover the story in depth, in 1998, under the headline “Murder appeal: despair drove woman to kill”. In the same year, Shah was awarded the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize to honour women and groups working to end male violence against women and girls. Although the 1998 appeal had been dismissed, in 2000 an intervention by then home secretary Jack Straw led to Zoora’s tariff being reduced by the lord chief justice from 20 to 12 years (she eventually served 14). Lord Bingham said, “This was the conduct of a desperate woman threatened with the loss of her home and with destitution in what remained for her a foreign country.”
When her mother was initially remanded to New Hall prison near Wakefield, Shah visited her five days a week – a six-hour round trip. After being convicted Zoora was moved to HMP Durham, where Shah saw serial killers Myra Hindley and Rose West. “I remember Rose West getting on her moral fickin’ high ground. She said, ‘There’s a poisoner working in the kitchens’ and wouldn’t eat Mum’s food.”
I ask Shah if what happened to her mother politicised her? “Oh God yeah. What about this wouldn’t politicise me? I felt the sheer injustice of what happened, and what really pissed me off is when you presented this story to judges, they just didn’t get it. These were people high on their perches, especially in those days.”
In 2006, Zoora was finally released, at the age of 54. Shah writes that she was timid and broken, “hollowed out, nervous like a tiny shivering bird”. She was so used to seeking permission for everything, she asked Shah if she could use her toilet. But after working in a charity shop, she gradually reintegrated herself into the community.
Zoora is now staying with Shah, but she’s not here today; she is still on licence and is unwilling to talk to the press. How is she doing? “Mum is doing good.” Has she forgiven herself for what she did? “Yes because she’s been to Hajj. She also had lots of counselling in prison, and she knows she was driven to do it. Does she regret it? Yes, of course she does.”
As for Shah, she went from strength to strength, from broken girl to a formidable campaigner with a successful career. After packing crisps, she went on to become a social worker and ended up as a commissioning manager for public health, responsible for a £5m budget.
In 2014, Shah was one of five women invited by Labour MP Khalid Mahmood to attend a meeting above an Indian restaurant in Bradford. None of them knew why they were there. They discovered it was to address the “Galloway problem”. In 2012, George Galloway had won Bradford West for Respect. Labour had decided to opt for an all-women shortlist, and the guests had been invited to see if they fancied taking him on. The four other women declined to stand. Shah had never considered running for parliament before, but told Mahmood, “I could chew him up and spit him out.”
Sure enough, she saw him off. “After I won, Galloway made this flipping bizarre speech about the hyenas dancing on the grave of a lion. And I was thinking, get over yourself, mate, you were the pussycat who lapped the imaginary milk on Big Brother.” Three general elections on, she’s still representing Bradford. In 2019, she won 76% of the vote, making hers the safest of the 28 Labour seats in the Yorkshire and Humber region. But in 2024 she got a shock, holding on to her seat by only 707 votes when challenged by two independents standing on pro-Palestine tickets. The result said more about her constituents’ anger towards Labour over its stance on Gaza and Israel than it said about her.
Ironically, Shah’s greatest crisis as an MP had come eight years earlier because of her hostility to Israel. In 2016, she was suspended from Labour when social media posts from 2014 resurfaced, one featuring a graphic that superimposed Israel on to a map of the US under the heading “Solution for Israel-Palestine Conflict – Relocate Israel into United States”. Underneath she had written “Problem solved”. In another post, she had written “#IsraelApartheid” accompanied by the quote “Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was ‘legal’”, the suggestion being that Israel’s behaviour was comparable to that of Nazi Germany.
Does she think it was right that she was suspended? She nods. “Shall I be honest with you? I said to Jeremy Corbyn two days before I was suspended, ‘Let me resign my whip.’ Here’s the thing for me: after I shared that bloody meme, I knew I’d hurt a community, so it was like, I need to apologise. It was about the transportation of Jews, like they did in the Holocaust, that’s what the inference was. So I stepped down from my position as PPS to John McDonnell and said, ‘I want to go in the chamber and make a statement’, so I made the apology.” Later that day she was suspended, despite the apology.
“I’ll be straight with you,” Shah continues, “when I got suspended, my understanding of antisemitism wasn’t what it is today. I thought it was a hatred of Jews and I was like, well, I don’t hate Jews. The previous week I’d been at a seder with [senior rabbi and inclusion and development coach] Laura Janner-Klausner, so I can’t be antisemitic. For me it was genuine ignorance. A lovely guy called Mark Gardner from the Community Security Trust [a charity that protects Jewish people from antisemitism and terrorism] came to see me, and I’m forever grateful for how he explained it to me.” What did he say? “He said it was the concept of how people talk about Jews leading to hatred of Jews, then it leads to the persecution of Jews, which led to the Holocaust. Hitler talked about Jews having money and power, and these are antisemitic tropes, right? I then understood it as the other side of the coin to Islamophobia.”
In 2019, Shah was called a “grooming gangs apologist” by the pro-Brexit group Leave.EU. She sued and won, but is still furious. “Before the Tommy Robinsons of this world were talking about grooming, I was talking about it. Even before I had political ambitions, I was talking about grooming – about how livid the Pakistani community is and how it stands with victims of abuse because it’s just not who we are. Any society has its bad apples, but it doesn’t mean that’s the whole of a society.”
Does she think Britain’s Pakistani community has a disproportionate problem with grooming? “I think there is a model of grooming that is pertinent to Pakistani men. There is no doubt about it. They are over-represented in the street model of grooming, which accounts for a small percentage of grooming and is one Tommy Robinson and Rupert Lowe have an issue with, but they don’t have an issue with any other kind of grooming. For me, abuse is abuse, and it’s all horrific.”
Shah is sitting on the floor by the fire. “I love my fire.” She’ll never forget how she struggled to keep warm. I ask how she thinks her Labour government is doing. “Pfftttt,” she says, dejectedly. “We’ve got a challenge. We’re not good at communicating the brilliant things we have done. Parts of me are pleased. One of my staffers has just had a baby and said the free childcare she gets is worth an extra £1,000 a month. And when you hear that’s what it does to your life, having a Labour government, that makes me smile.” So why the pfftttt? “We should have been better at things like the two-child benefits cap. Own goals like the winter fuel allowance. And the noise of Reform doesn’t help. We need to stop contributing to that and get our message out there.”
Is Labour trying to out-Reform Reform? Look, she says, migration is a real issue. “My constituents are pissed with illegal immigration. The idea that it’s not a thing that affects people of migrant heritage or of colour just isn’t true. But we need to do more telling of the positive migrant story; their contribution to the economy. If we didn’t have migrants, the NHS would collapse tomorrow.”
What did she think of Labour refusing to let Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham contest the forthcoming Gorton and Denton byelection? “I was one of 50 signatories to say it was the wrong decision.” Who would she choose between Starmer and Burnham? “If they’d been contesting the leadership together, I’d have gone for Burnham. Right now, I’d have to think about it.”
Despite the government lurching from calamity to calamity, Shah says she adores her job. “I promise you I feel like I’ve found my calling. I love what I do. I love it with a passion. There’s not a day I don’t wake up looking forward to it. I’m not politically ambitious for position and power. I don’t want to be a minister. I hold my power in a much more authentic way as a backbencher.”
She still blinks at the idea that the girl who was forced into a marriage at 15 and fought so long to get her mother out of jail has represented her community for 11 years. I ask when she felt she recovered her izzat; her honour. Her eyes light up like lasers. “In my eyes I never lost it. Because izzat for me is standing against inequality and injustice, and I’ve done that all my life.”

Sông Quê Phở Bar, London E1: ‘The best phở in town’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants

Some hot dining spots seem to expand almost the moment they open, but east London’s Vietnamese stalwart Sông Quê has waited almost 25 years to spawn a little sister, Sông Quê Phở Bar. The new offshoot sits on Commercial Street, a mile or so down the road, and serves a tiny menu focusing on phở, as well as a smattering of the original cafe’s small plates in the form of summer rolls, green papaya salad, grilled lamb chops and savoury banh khot cupcakes.
Quite why Sông Quê, with its regular weekend queues and well-known name, took so long to branch out, however, is unknown. Still, why rush things? After all, the road to restaurant ruin is paved with premature brand roll-outs, and even if managers think they’re superhuman, they cannot be in two – or three or four – sites all at the same time. Plus, the big question with an institution such as the OG Sông Quê is: can you really recreate the magic elsewhere?
The new phở bar has appeared in what at a glance seems a pretty good location, almost directly opposite the much-adored (not least by me) Xian Biang Biang Noodles (go for the belt noodles, I implore you), and close to the beloved Thai hotspot Som Saa. It’s also just down the road from somewhere called Slurp Thai, but the less said about that name, the better.
But is it a good location? The Spitalfields margins, in that sort-of-Aldgate and close-to-Shoreditch area, can be curiously hard to lure passing trade into, so, if I’m honest, I’m actually not so sure. Lauded fish chef Tom Brown opened The Pearly Queen on this very site only a couple of years ago, and that vanished pretty rapidly, and before that it was a Turkish spot called The Space, which made no impact on the London dining scene at all.
One Sunday earlier this month, it was also a bit of a concern to find ourselves the only customers at the new phở bar. Beforehand, I’d worried about not having booked a table, only to find we had the pick of the whole restaurant, and on both floors, too. Still, the staff were bright and chipper, and young enough to tell me, in tones that suggested they were talking about medieval times, that the original Sông Quê opened in 2002; they also seemed genuinely surprised that we had working stoves and electricity way back then. The new place, however, feels more like a canteen that’s there to do one job well: pop by for a bowl of their beef broth noodle soup topped with a choice of beef, beef balls, chicken, prawns or tofu.
My rare beef flank phở came thinly sliced, blushingly pink and generously served atop a bowl of thin, al dente noodles and a fistful of chopped spring onion, and all of it drowned in a very meaningful broth. Star anise is a shining light in this rich, sweet, warmly spiced soup. They also do their famous bun bo hue, which is slightly different from the phở in that it features well done beef flank and pork sausage, or spicy prawns or tofu, and is served with loads of fresh herbs. And if the idea of soup noodles leaves you cold, there’s also a grilled lemongrass chicken and vermicelli dish with gloriously fiery chicken thigh.
Those small plates shouldn’t be ignored, either, so we didn’t. We galloped through grilled beef wrapped in betel leaves, scattered with handfuls of chunky peanuts, dressed with a semi-hedgerow of fresh mint and dunked in a hot, sweet dipping sauce. This place does not skimp on its garnishes. We moved on to little juicy bullets of spicy tempura squid flanked by raw chilli, and a serving of those grilled lamb chops that look like nothing much but that have a truly gorgeous char and come with an oddly unobtrusive, vinegar-based dipping sauce that has just the right amount of sharpness to carry the heft of the meat.
It was at this point in the meal – roughly around the time I was devouring those cute little prawn cupcakes that are in fact little more than egg and cornflour moulded into little baskets, but that are jolly nice when dipped in something spicy and sweet – that I began to think: “Where the hell is everyone?” This is a jolly handy little spot, and there’s no way it can survive on midweek office workers alone while losing out at weekends to the likes of Slurp Thai simply because that’s a few blocks closer to Shoreditch’s main drag.
This is one of those places where I say: use it or lose it. Right now, they have seats going, so take a friend, or a book, and settle down to the best phở in town. What’s more, if you’re antisocial and like Vietnamese treats, well, right now, Sông Quê will feel like heaven.

Viral dance challenge lifted Chinese ibuprofen maker’s shares – now they are languishing
Slumping profits at Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical have dragged the shares to about HK$7 in December 2025 from HK$15.62 in December 2022
When an ibuprofen dance challenge went viral on the Chinese social media platform Douyin in late 2022 during the Covid-19 pandemic, shares of the country’s leading ibuprofen maker surged more than 200 per cent in two weeks.
Now profits at Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical are plunging, and it is not alone, as drug makers are hit by oversupply and weakening demand.
The net profit at Shandong Xinhua, a leading manufacturer and exporter of fever and pain medicines, including ibuprofen, fell 26 per cent year on year to 256.2 million yuan (US$37 million) in the first three quarters of 2025, according to its exchange filing.
The earlier spike in Shandong Xinhua’s shares came as social media influencers mimicked the poses of a red human-shaped figure on the ibuprofen packaging, cheering up social media users and offering a brief escape from pandemic anxiety in December 2022. That month, the mainland began moving away from its “zero-Covid” strategy, lifting lockdowns, ending mass testing and reopening public venues.
The trend soon inspired tens of thousands to replicate the influencers with spins, stretches and jump kicks.
Shandong Xinhua’s slump extends a downturn that began in 2024, when full-year net profit fell 5.3 per cent from a year earlier. The company attributed the profit decline to price cuts on key products to defend its market share.

The real-life murder case behind ‘The Lady’: How Sarah Ferguson’s former dresser went from the palace to prison
A new drama about Jane Andrews, Sarah Ferguson’s ex-right-hand woman who ended up in jail for murder, is airing just as the former duchess is already at the centre of a media storm. Katie Rosseinsky looks back at the harrowing case

From a terrace in Grimsby to Buckingham Palace – then on to the Old Bailey and Her Majesty’s Prison. It is hardly a surprise that the story of Jane Andrews, the former dresser and right-hand woman to Sarah Ferguson who was later jailed for the murder of her boyfriend Thomas Cressman, became something of a grim cause célèbre in the early Noughties. After all, it had all the components of a very British tabloid scandal: class anxiety, mingled with royalty and shocking violence.
Headlines branded Andrews, the Lincolnshire woman who had ascended from humble beginnings to earn the nickname “Lady Jane” from her employer, a “bunny boiler” or the “Fatal Attraction” killer. She was portrayed as a callous and jealous social climber, fixated upon securing a place among the upper classes. Andrews, however, contended that she had been a victim of abuse.
Twenty-five years on from her trial, Andrews’ tale is now the subject of The Lady, a four-part, “partially fictionalised” drama from ITV, made by the producers behind The Crown. Bafta Rising Star winner Mia McKenna-Bruce plays Andrews, whose trajectory has been described by show writer Debbie O’Malley as a “toxic fairytale”, while Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer dons a very red wig to play the former Duchess of York.
The series, of course, could hardly have landed at a worse time for said former duchess. Newly released emails from the Epstein files have put her contact with the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein – even after his 2008 conviction for procuring a girl under the age of 18 for prostitution – back in the spotlight.
Then, on Thursday, her ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, amid claims that he shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy. Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to his connections with Epstein; he doesn’t appear in The Lady, either, a creative decision the producers may well be thanking themselves for right now.
Dormer has already distanced herself from the role. Back in September, when a leaked email showed that Ferguson had called Epstein a “steadfast, generous and supreme friend” after having claimed to have severed ties, the actor said that she would no longer promote The Lady. “Since completing the project, new information has come to light that makes it impossible for me to reconcile my values with Sarah Ferguson’s behaviour, which I believe is inexcusable,” she said, adding that she would donate her salary to charities supporting childhood victims of sexual abuse.
McKenna-Bruce, meanwhile, contends that the show “is Jane’s story, it’s not Fergie’s story”.
Andrews was born in Lincolnshire in 1967 to a working-class family, whose financial difficulties formed the backdrop to her childhood. When she was eight, debts meant that her parents had to sell their home and move to a smaller place in Grimsby, with an outdoor toilet. “I remember one day we didn’t have enough to buy a loaf of bread and Mum had us looking down the sides of the settee and in our coats for money to scrape together,” she recalled in a 2003 interview.
From an early age, Andrews seemed to struggle with her mental health, experiencing depression, panic attacks and an eating disorder. At the age of 15, she tried to take her own life for the first time. It was around this time, in her mid-to-late teens, that she would start to become unhealthily dependent on her intimate relationships, she later told The Guardian, a result of low self-esteem and fears of abandonment.
Her love of fashion, though, came to represent a promise of escape. Andrews studied fashion in college and started working in Marks & Spencer. In 1988, she answered an anonymous advert in a copy of The Lady, the high society magazine, for a gig as a personal dresser. Months went by before she would eventually be invited for an interview. Her mysterious would-be employer? Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, who was then married to the Queen’s favourite son and expecting her first child, Princess Beatrice.
The two very different women seemed to have an instant rapport, and Andrews got the job. “I was running away from all the horrible things in my past that Grimsby represented,” she later said. “I arrived at King’s Cross with a suitcase and £10 in my pocket. I got in a taxi and said, ‘Side door of Buckingham Palace’ and the driver made a joke.” When she arrived, she received flowers from Fergie, along with a card that read “Welcome to the team”, signed by “The Boss”.
In the ITV show, McKenna-Bruce’s Andrews becomes fast friends with the duchess by sharing snippets from her tumultuous romantic life, while overhauling her own image to align with the upper-class milieu in which she was now mixing. We see her upgrading her own wardrobe to fancier designers, and hear her lengthening her vowels to disguise her roots “oop north”, as Dormer’s Fergie rather hamfistedly puts it.
In the media storm that surrounded her trial, Andrews was painted as a calculated social climber who deliberately and strategically made herself over to better ascend the ladder; there was even a suggestion that she deliberately mirrored the duchess, whose apparently ironic nickname for her dresser was “Lady Jane”. One report from The Telegraph even claimed that “friends said Andrews was devoted to the duchess to the point of obsession, assuming her characteristics and copying her style”.
But for Andrews, this makeover was less some monomaniacal fixation with her employer, more just a consequence of an ordinary young woman suddenly finding herself in the upper echelons and attempting to fit in. “I was a country bumpkin,” she told The Guardian. “Suddenly, I was at Balmoral mixing with the royals, having long chats with Princess Diana. I was 21 years old, and of course I enjoyed it. If my accent changed, it was only because people made fun of the way I said ‘bath’ and ‘grass’.”
In the introduction to a travel book released in 1993, Ferguson included a special dedication to her right-hand woman, “whose loyalty and kindness knows no bounds”. Later, the duchess’s marital woes only brought the pair closer together – especially as Andrews, who had tied the knot with an IBM executive two decades her senior in 1990, was also floundering in her marriage. This eventually ended in 1997, a year after Fergie’s split from Andrew.
But the relationship between the two women would eventually sour. In 1997, Andrews was made redundant, with the palace citing cost-cutting reasons. Being let go came as a huge blow to her, after she had spent almost a decade entwined with the duchess’s day-to-day life. Fergie reportedly did not break the news in person and, Andrews has alleged, had only just told her, “I’ll never get rid of you, you’re with me for life.”
Recently divorced and dumped by her employer, Andrews became depressed, and struggled to find a new job, although she eventually secured positions with upmarket jewellers including Theo Fennell (father of Wuthering Heights director Emerald) and Annabel Jones.
In 1998, she met Thomas Cressman, a wealthy businessman whose father was a former director of Aston Villa football club. Later reports claimed that Andrews saw their relationship as a potential route back into the high society lifestyle she had previously enjoyed as part of Ferguson’s inner circle.
In the summer of 2000, the couple went on holiday to the South of France. But what should have been a romantic trip turned into a disaster. Later reports claimed Andrews had apparently been expecting a proposal, only for Cressman to tell her that he had no plans for anything of the sort.
Upon their return to London, they became embroiled in an argument so heated that Cressman eventually called 999, telling the operator: “We are rowing, someone is going to get hurt unless… I would like [the] police to come and split us up.” No one came to Cressman’s Fulham flat to follow up.
Andrews later beat him with a cricket bat and stabbed him with a knife from the kitchen; his body was found the following day, and the police began trying to locate his girlfriend, who appeared to have gone on the run. They even sought the help of the duchess, who left two voicemail messages for her former employee, imploring Andrews to turn herself in. She was eventually discovered in her car in Cornwall, having taken an overdose.
At her murder trial at the Old Bailey in 2001, Andrews’ stance was that she had acted in self-defence. The prosecution argued that she was a gold digger obsessed with the idea of marrying Cressman, and therefore cementing her status in high society, and had flown into a violent rage when it became clear this was not going to happen. Her defence claimed that Cressman had been physically abusive and sexually violent towards her throughout the relationship, and noted that her depression “would have heightened her sense of fear and helplessness”, according to a BBC report.
These allegations horrified Cressman’s family, who described them as “a whole tissue of lies”. The jury eventually discounted them, choosing to convict Andrews of murder rather than the lesser charge of manslaughter. “In killing the man you loved, you ended his life and ruined your own,” the judge told her.
She eventually received a life sentence, which she unsuccessfully appealed in 2003, citing a diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder, a mental health condition that can manifest as emotional instability and impulsive behaviour, according to the NHS. She also claimed that memories of sexual abuse from her childhood had been triggered by Cressman’s alleged behaviour. The Court of Appeal, however, declined to admit the evidence.
In jail, Andrews was reportedly nicknamed “Fergie’s bird”. She made headlines once again in 2009 when, shortly after she was transferred to an open prison, she made a bid for freedom, apparently jumping over a wall and then laying low in a nearby Premier Inn with her family, until she was caught and returned. She eventually left prison in 2019, and found work in a supermarket (which she would later lose when her identity was uncovered). Now aged 57, she is reportedly now working at a charity-funded animal hospital.
O’Malley, the writer behind The Lady, has said that the show is “about understanding the human behind the headlines”, and doesn’t seek to “apportion blame in other places, but to understand how someone could get to that point”. Whether the current headlines circling around Andrews’ former friend and boss will overshadow some of the drama’s nuance, though, is out of the writer’s hands now.

Council fights ‘greedy land tax grab’ over kinders, parks and gardens

Council fights ‘greedy land tax grab’ over kinders, parks and gardens
Few would notice the narrow garden bed that borders the car park of Werribee’s Bridge Hotel.
But the 18-square-metre strip, which features a row of gum trees, shrubs and a grey electrical services box, attracted more than $70,000 in land tax bills over three years and has become the unlikely focus of a multimillion fight between Wyndham Council and the state government.
Between 2021 and 2023, the State Revenue Office sent the garden owner, Wyndham City Council, an annual land tax bill, totalling $22,804 in 2021 and rising to $25,386.50 in 2022 and 2023.
The Watton Street garden bed is now part of a multimillion-dollar tax row with Wyndham formally objecting to what it calls a “greedy tax grab” on more than 20 council-owned parcels of land including drainage channels and power lines.
The disputed list of “properties” also includes not-for-profit kindergartens and maternal and child health centres, community sports fields, an animal pound, land reserved for telco towers and public parks bequeathed to council by developers.
The council has also called for the Auditor-General to investigate whether land tax is being improperly imposed not just on Wyndham, but across all 79 Victorian councils.
Wyndham is seeking a refund of $5.359 million it paid in land taxes on more than 20 properties between 2021 and 2023. It is yet to receive a land tax assessment on the same parcels of land for 2024 and 2025, and is requesting the tax for those years be waived.
Wyndham mayor Josh Gilligan said the council was being taxed millions of dollars on properties from which it accrues no revenue, robbing it of vital funds for essential services.
“Ratepayers are being double-taxed on kinders, sporting ovals and garden beds and the state needs to end their greedy tax grab immediately,” he said.
“We estimate that there are millions of dollars of taxes sitting on balance sheets of government agencies and councils across Victoria that have been paid that will need to be refunded,” he said.
The largest disputed tax bill – $4.3 million – is for 62 hectares of land earmarked for a future 8000-lot suburb built around a 15,000-seat rectangular sports stadium in Tarneit. The public-private partnership between Wyndham and Western Melbourne Group, the owners of A-League club Western United, stalled last year as the soccer club had its competition licence revoked, and the Australian Tax Office pursued its owners over a $15.5 million debt, which was repaid in January.
According to the council’s objection, Wyndham entered into a caretaker agreement with a local farmer to crop the Tarneit land, maintain firebreaks and control noxious weeds. The State Revenue Office’s tax assessment was triggered when the farmer was paid for the sale of his crops, even though the council received no revenue from the sale.
The council is also disputing a $19,837 assessment it received in 2023 for Wyndham Harbour, a Werribee South marina built on Crown land and managed by council under a 99-year lease.
The Age submitted detailed questions to the State Revenue Office on why these parcels had been assessed as liable for land tax. A spokesperson said the office was unable to comment on individual tax matters.
“Land owned by a municipality is exempt from land tax as long as the land is not used for business purposes, although some exceptions apply,” the spokesperson said.
Dr David Hayward, Emeritus Professor of Public Policy and the Social Economy at RMIT University, said the dispute indicated Wyndham council was trying to regain some control over its revenue after 10 years of government-imposed rate capping.
Victorian councils argue that the state government’s ongoing rate capping policy is constraining their ability to deliver services. A parliamentary inquiry found last year that rate capping is threatening their financial viability, but also delivering lower rates to about 40 per cent of ratepayers.
“It’s easy for the state government to say, ‘We’re capping rates to support cost of living’, which is true, but it’s pretty tough on councils, so I wouldn’t be surprised if there are a lot of these little conflicts popping up because their main source of revenue is obviously rates, and they’re not in control of them,” Hayward said.
The disputed sum is a small fraction of Victoria’s total land tax take: $9.254 billion in 2024-25, rising to $10.098 billion this financial year, according to Parliamentary Budget Office analysis published this month.
“It’s small in terms of the total revenue for the state, but for a cash-strapped council $5 million is a lot of money,” Hayward said.
Municipal Association of Victoria president Cr Jennifer Anderson said continued scrutiny of the land tax system was important, to ensure exemptions for local government remained fit for purpose.

Lithuanian school student develops smart helmet after surviving motorcycle crash

A 16-year-old student from Panevėžys has developed a smart helmet control system designed to save lives after surviving a motorcycle accident that he says could have ended very differently.
Modestas Raila created a universal device that alerts riders if their helmet is not properly fastened. The system emits a warning sound until the helmet is securely strapped.
“If it senses that this part is not touching the neck, it starts beeping. It will keep beeping until you fasten it,” Raila said while demonstrating his invention.
The concept is similar to a car seat belt warning system, but adapted for motorcyclists. A special sensor reacts only to contact with the rider’s neck to avoid false alarms. An integrated speed sensor ensures the signal activates only when the vehicle is moving, not when the rider is walking.
Raila said the idea stemmed from personal experience.
“After flying over a car and landing sideways with my head on the asphalt, I realised the helmet saved my life – precisely because it was fastened,” he said. “Later, I learned from people around me that riding with an unfastened helmet is quite common. Some people don’t survive.”
His teacher, Laura Kuchalskienė, said Raila has been impressing classmates and educators with inventions since primary school. Over the years, he has built elaborate Rube Goldberg-style machines that make lemonade and hamburgers, a foot-operated piano, reaction games and even a homemade buggy.
“This year’s idea is probably the most serious one yet,” Kuchalskienė said. “Previous projects attracted large audiences because they were very playful. But this year’s idea addresses a real safety issue.”
Raila said investors have already shown interest in the device, and he plans to turn the invention into a business. He hopes the product will eventually be available in physical and online shops and become a new safety standard.
In the future, he plans to adapt the helmet safety system for use by electric scooter riders and cyclists.

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. US insists Iran give up uranium enrichment, Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff said, adding that this is a red line in negotiations for Washington.
"The President gave Jared (US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner - TASS) and I direction before we went over there (for talks with Iran - TASS), there were red lines, zero enrichment. We have to have the material (enriched uranium - TASS) back," he said in an interview with the Fox News TV channel.
Witkoff claimed Tehran would have enough uranium enriched to the level needed to make a nuclear bomb within a week.

Trump says he’s sending a hospital boat to Greenland. Nobody knows why
Trump did not say when the ship will arrive or how long it could stay
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump announced the U.S. is “going to send a great hospital boat” to Greenland.
But it’s unclear why the island needs one, which boat he is sending, and when.
The president shared his announcement on his Truth Social account Saturday evening, shortly before hosting a dinner for governors at the White House. Trump noted that he’s working with Jeff Landry, Louisiana’s Republican governor, whom he named the U.S. special envoy to Greenland late last year.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The president’s post included an illustration of the USNS Mercy, which is one of two hospital ships operated by the U.S. Navy. He did not say when the ship might arrive, or how long it would stay. It’s also unclear what specifically prompted Trump’s decision. The Greenlandic government provides free healthcare to residents.
The boat and its sister vessel the USNS Comfort are moored in Mobile, Alabama, according to naval trackers.
The Independent has requested more information from the White House, the Department of Defense and Landry’s office.
The announcement also arrived hours after Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command evacuated a crew member from a U.S. submarine in Greenlandic waters, according to Reuters. The crew member required urgent medical attention, authorities said.
The U.S. Navy sailor had to be medically evacuated from a nuclear-powered submarine that broke from its mission and surfaced roughly eight miles from Nuuk, Greenland.
Landry re-shared Trump’s announcement on X, writing, “Thank you, President @realDonaldTrump! Proud to work with you on this important issue!”
Orla Joelsen, a prominent Greenlandic activist, reacted to Trump’s announcement on X, writing, “No thanks!!!”
“We in Greenland are healthy and doing well, sustained by our own traditional foods — including seal blubber, which is rich in vitamins and nutrients that have kept our population strong for generations,” he said.
Trump and his allies have repeatedly argued the U.S. must acquire Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark, for national security purposes. Meanwhile, Greenlandic officials have maintained the island is not for sale, and that it should remain a territory of Denmark.
Late last month, Trump announced the “framework of a future deal” on Greenland.
“Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,” he wrote on Truth Social.
Trump’s push for Greenland appears to be unpopular among many Americans. An AP-NORC poll published earlier this month found that 72 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of the way Trump is handling Greenland, while just 24 percent approve.

Rape charges, Epstein links and sperm donor scandal: the dark secrets rocking Norway’s royal house
Unknown

A series of scandals involving members of Norway’s royal family has placed the monarchy under intense public scrutiny, as the eldest son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit stands trial on multiple criminal charges and fresh attention focuses on the crown princess’s past ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Marius Borg Høiby, 29, the son of Mette-Marit from a previous relationship, was indicted earlier this month in Oslo on 38 counts, including allegations of rape, violence against a former partner, drug offenses and making threats. Prosecutors have said he could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The trial is expected to continue through mid-March.
Høiby was first arrested in August 2024 on suspicion of assaulting a woman in her 20s at an apartment in Oslo. Norwegian media reported that the woman was treated for a concussion. Høiby was detained for about 30 hours before being released.
Days later, he issued a public statement acknowledging that he had caused bodily harm and damaged property following an argument while under the influence of alcohol and cocaine.
“I committed bodily harm and destroyed objects in the apartment after an argument and under the influence of alcohol and cocaine,” he said at the time. “This should not have happened.”
He also said he has struggled with mental health issues and apologized to the woman involved and to his family.
In November 2024, Høiby was arrested again on suspicion of rape. In February 2025, he was formally charged in connection with the alleged rape of Norwegian television presenter Linni Meister. According to British media reports citing police documents, the alleged assault took place in 2018 during a private gathering at Skaugum Castle, the official residence of the crown prince and crown princess. Police have said they obtained videos and photographs related to the case from Høiby’s computer.
Høiby has not publicly entered a plea on the most recent charges.
Two days before the trial began, Oslo police confirmed he had been arrested again on suspicion of assault, making threats with a knife and violating a restraining order.
The Norwegian royal household has sought to distance itself from the case. In 2017, the palace announced that Høiby would live as a private citizen and would not undertake royal duties. At the time, Mette-Marit said her son would “always be an important and beloved part of our family” but would not carry public responsibilities like his half-siblings.
Mette-Marit, 52, married Crown Prince Haakon in 2001. Haakon, also 52, is the son of King Harald V and Queen Sonja and is heir to the Norwegian throne. The couple has two children together, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 21, and Prince Sverre Magnus, 20.
Their marriage drew public debate at the time because Mette-Marit, a single mother who had worked as a waitress, had no royal background and had spoken openly about a rebellious youth. In a 2001 news conference, she acknowledged past drug use and said she regretted earlier choices.
More recently, renewed attention has focused on her past association with Epstein, who died in a U.S. jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. In 2008, Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida to soliciting prostitution from a minor and served 13 months in jail.
In 2019, Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv reported that Mette-Marit met Epstein several times between 2011 and 2013, after his conviction. The palace confirmed that one meeting took place at Epstein’s residence and said Crown Prince Haakon encountered Epstein once in 2012 while on vacation in St. Barts.
The palace has said Mette-Marit ended contact with Epstein in 2014 after concluding he was attempting to use his association with her to connect with others.
Earlier this year, newly released documents related to Epstein included references to Mette-Marit, including email exchanges from 2011 and 2012. Some of the correspondence was described in media reports as personal in tone.
In a recent statement, the crown princess said she regretted the association.
“Jeffrey Epstein was solely responsible for his crimes,” she said. “However, I must take responsibility for not having investigated his background more thoroughly and for not understanding earlier what kind of person he was. I show poor judgment, and I regret having had any contact with him.”
The controversies have fueled broader debate in Norway about the role and judgment of the royal family, whose duties are largely ceremonial under the country’s constitutional monarchy.
Additional attention has centered on Princess Märtha Louise, 53, Haakon’s older sister. In 2002, she relinquished her royal title to pursue private business activities. In recent years, she has drawn criticism for spiritual ventures, including claims that she can communicate with angels, and for her 2024 marriage to Durek Verrett, a self-described shaman.
Separately, historian Tor Bomann-Larsen has raised questions about the lineage of King Harald’s grandfather, King Olav V, suggesting in a recent publication that Olav may have been conceived with the help of a sperm donor in 1902 after years of unsuccessful attempts by his parents to produce an heir. The claim has not been proven and has been rejected by royal supporters. A forthcoming biography is expected to examine the issue further.
King Harald V, 88, has reigned since 1991. Norway’s monarchy, which dates back more than a century in its modern form, remains broadly popular, but the succession of scandals has presented one of its most challenging periods in recent years.

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. Special US Envoy Steve Witkoff expressed hope that a new round of talks on Ukraine could take place within the next three weeks, which would subsequently result in a meeting between Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky.
"We're hopeful, Jared (US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner - TASS) and I, that we've put some proposals on the table to both sides that will bring them together in the next three weeks and maybe even result in a summit between Zelensky and President Putin that might end up being a trilateral at some point with the [US] President, we'll have to see. I think he doesn't want to come to a meeting unless he feels that he can consummate this thing and get the best result," he said in an interview with the Fox News TV channel.
Witkoff expressed hope that "some good news" will appear on the issue of the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict in the coming weeks.

Ukrainian resilience remains strong as war enters fifth year

Ukrainian resilience remains strong as war enters fifth year
February 22, 2026The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) published a poll in early February examining Ukrainians' attitudes towards the war. The survey was conducted in late January, when massive Russian attacks on energy facilities caused power outages and disrupted heating and water systems across the country, particularly in Kyiv. These strikes were happening at a time when temperatures dropped as low as minus 25 degrees Celsius.
The KIIS poll found that 88% of respondents thought Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy system were designed to force the country to surrender. Yet, 65% of those interviewed said they were prepared to tough it out as long as necessary. Several months earlier, in September and December 2025, some 62% had said the same.
"This January didn't make me more determined and angry, because I've been very determined and angry since 2022," Julia, a Kyiv resident, told DW. "It's just another stage of an extremely difficult battle that we will win one way or another."
Julia's husband, with whom she has a daughter, has been deployed on the battlefield since 2024.
"My anger helps me to remain steadfast, but also the knowledge that there is no other choice. Anything other than standing firm would be much worse," Julia said.
Justice and survival
One of the most important factors strengthening people's resilience is the realization that Russia's war against Ukraine is an existential one, said KIIS head Anton Hruschezkyj. For the Ukrainians, he explained, the war is not just about justice, but about sheer survival.
"Ukrainian resilience is still high. While they are exhausted and open to making difficult concessions, they are not prepared to cross certain 'red lines.'"
Russian attempts to make everyday life unbearable for normal Ukrainians have not changed this mindset, he said. Ukrainians, he added, have begun describing this hardship as "Cholodomor," or "murder by cold." This term is term derived from "Holodomor", which translated to "death by starvation," and is the name given to the man‑made famine in Soviet Ukraine at the hands of Josef Stalin's regime in 1932 and 1933.
Ukrainians are exhausted from chronic war stress, said psychologist Kateryna Kudrschynska. "It takes its toll on the body, the nervous system and the psyche." She thinks Ukrainian resilience also stems from the refusal to lose more after already giving up so much.
Ukrainians want to rebuild their country
"We want to persevere, because if we surrender, it will be much worse under Russian leadership," Natalia, a Kyiv-based student, told DW. She has come to the capital's Independence Square to place a small flag at an improvised memorial for fallen soldiers in honor of her late father. He recently died in Ukraine's Donetsk region.
The student, who fled abroad at the beginning of the war only to return later, sometimes finds the loss of her father, the extreme living conditions and the country's overall situation difficult to bear. "I draw strength from the fact that I live for my father, who wanted to live and build a future with his family," she said. "I can't give up because of him. I am convinced that Ukraine has a future."
"Ukraine is my home, I don't want to leave. I want to rebuild my country."
Olha is another Kyiv resident toughing it out. "I can't take my child by the hand and walk away," said the mother of a two-year-old. "That would be a betrayal of my husband, who is fighting in the war." Olha's husband volunteered to defend Ukraine at the beginning of the Russian invasion and is currently deployed in the Pokrovsk region. He comes home very rarely. Olha raises their son and also works part-time.
She said her compatriots are seeing Russia facing economic problems and are comforted by the fact that Russia has not managed to achieve any significant military victories in four years. That's why she thinks Ukrainians are optimistic everything will turn out well.
Exhausted but determined soldiers
Serhij* volunteered to join the Ukrainian armed forces as a medic four years ago. He said fighters are growing less motivated and resilient because there are no fixed deployment times, hardly any opportunities for demobilization and inadequate financial provision for soldiers who are not deployed at the front.
Kyrylo serves as a telecommunications specialist with the Ukrainian land forces. He told DW that his comrades have resigned themselves to the lack of rest: "We've settled in so well that you don't even remember what it was like before. If you had plans for the future, you no longer have any now. This is not pessimism. It's more like: 'Whatever will be, will be'. It's a kind of humility, not despondency."
Kyrylos admitted that the mood in the army is strained due to government corruption scandals and cases of misappropriated defense industry funds. Such revelations make him and his comrades feel cheated.
"Personally, when my motivation wanes, all I have left is discipline and the realization that Ukraine, this nation, this identity may no longer exist if we don't persevere and fight," said Mos, who serves in a Ukrainian drone regiment. He, too, deals with burnout and feelings of apathy. Yet Mos said that realizing there is no alternative but to resist helps him regain motivation.
What does Ukraine's future hold
Hrushetsky believes that Ukrainians' ability to fight on as the war enters its fifth year also depends on the knowledge that European partners continue to provide support.
"The current suffering is seen as an investment in the future," he said. "Our latest data shows that more than 60% [of Ukrainians] remain optimistic and believe that Ukraine will be a prosperous member of the European Union in ten years' time."
*The names of the three soldiers quoted in this story have been changed to protect their identities.

US claims China conducting secret tests in race for nuclear superiority

US claims China conducting secret tests in race for nuclear superiority
On the edge of a vast desert in north-west China lies a dried-up salt lake.
Its remote, barren location offers little support for civilisation but makes it the perfect site for secret nuclear testing.
This area, known as Lop Nur, or Lop Lake, is where the US government has alleged China has been conducting hidden nuclear explosive tests.
The revelation potentially signals a new phase in China’s ambitions to win the global nuclear arms race, just as the last remaining treaty between the US and Russia, aimed at preventing catastrophic nuclear war, expired this month.
China wants to expand its arsenal of 600 nuclear warheads to 1500 by 2035, according to official US estimates. This makes it the only party under a global non-proliferation treaty that is significantly expanding its stockpile.
Some of this expansion may be supported by a flurry of construction that has taken place at Lop Nur in recent years, including improved transport infrastructure that could facilitate the transfer of material to the site’s probable eastern testing area, which is visible in satellite imagery.
For China, “geopolitically, having a large nuclear weapons arsenal serves the ‘swagger’ idea,” said Renny Babiarz, a geospatial intelligence expert who specialises in China’s nuclear weapons program.
Nuclear weapons present “a strategic capability to have in the background to help negotiations or to keep other powers out”, he said. “It is a backstop for trying to keep other countries from intervening in the event there is any coercion in the Taiwan Strait. The war on Ukraine has only underscored the importance of that.”
Concerns over China’s nuclear expansion have been around for decades, though allegations of testing related to an apparent nuclear build-up that surfaced in 2020 in a series of arms-control reports by the US State Department.
While details provided by the US government at the time were scarce, Babiarz’s research released the following year revealed extensive expansion at Lop Nur, the site of China’s first nuclear tests in the 1960s.
New construction included large drill-rig activity, a probable underground facility, and numerous “adits” visible in satellite imagery. Adits are excavated areas on the side of a hill or mountain that can serve as an entrance to other underground facilities and chambers, where explosive tests could be conducted.
“Taken together, these observations suggest that China may be preparing for future nuclear weapons testing, which would mark a new phase in the modernisation and/or expansion of China’s nuclear weapons stockpile,” Babiarz wrote in a 2021 report to the State Department, noting that more analysis and study was needed.
Further details about China’s testing activities came from the US government this month, just one day after the nuclear arms control agreement, known as the New Start treaty, between the US and Russia expired.
US officials have since revealed that they believed an explosive nuclear weapons test was conducted on June 22, 2020. They said curious seismic activity registered in neighbouring Kazakhstan indicated such a test and that the Chinese military was preparing for more tests achieving supercritical yields in the range of hundreds of tonnes. Such activity, they said, was being purposefully and expertly concealed.
Experts have rushed to find clues that might present a clearer picture of what China was up to six years ago.
But satellite imagery focusing on the easternmost tunnel test area at Lop Nur analysed by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank, have been inconclusive, as not much activity or change is visible before and after the alleged June 2020 test.
The “Tunnel 5” area, or T5, has been of particular interest given construction and excavation activity in recent years.
Still, CSIS experts noted that it is possible China conducted an underground nuclear test at another tunnel area, or was able to mask the explosion, conducting a covert “decoupling” test, as US officials have alleged.
“Decoupling” is a method in which a device is detonated underground, reducing the magnitude of shockwaves coursing through surrounding rock, and therefore lowering the chance of registering seismic activity.
In other words, it’s one way for China to evade or minimise detection.
An exact determination of what happened on June 22, 2020 could be key in the future, as a test might indicate a “potential violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which China signed but never ratified, and might become justification for taking more action later”, noted Babiarz.
That China never ratified the treaty is part of Beijing’s playbook: to have plausible deniability, as it allows the government to say it had agreed in theory on the world stage but never in principle at home.
All this comes as President Donald Trump has pushed the US to resume nuclear testing after such activities ended in 1992, and as he continues to seek curbs on China’s nuclear weapons program. Trump has made clear that any renewed nuclear weapons agreement between the US and Russia, given the recent treaty expiry, ought to include China.
Aside from Lop Nur, China has several other secretive nuclear sites, a number of which are located in Sichuan province.
Satellite imagery has captured an increase in construction, including bunkers and facilities that suggested a capability for nuclear weapons production. Two of those sites – Zitong and Pingtong – are just 113 kilometres apart.
Nuclear ambitions in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran – all states hostile to the West, with the first three located in relative proximity – may mean the US seeks to divert resources to counter aggression, leaving Europe exposed.
That “could create uncertainties over the ability of US strategic forces to simultaneously deter aggression in two theatres”, wrote Darya Dolzikova, a senior research fellow specialising in nuclear proliferation and deterrence at UK defence think tank Rusi in a recent report.
“Growing US requirements to deter both China and Russia raise concerns over just how much the US nuclear umbrella can stretch in terms of capabilities before it starts to leak.”
China has vehemently denied US allegations over nuclear testing in 2020, claiming it adheres to a policy of never being the first to use nuclear weapons. Sources have also told the London Telegraph that Beijing refuses to engage on the issue diplomatically.
In 2020, Christopher Ford, the then US under-secretary for arms control, and author of the initial reports raising explosive testing concerns, confronted Fu Cong, the then Chinese ambassador to the European Union, about Beijing’s nuclear activities.
“Fu’s answer was telling: he did not deny that [China] was expanding its arsenal – claiming merely that ‘China will not expand its nuclear arsenal to a large extent’, but declared that Chinese policy was a reaction to China facing ‘more threats from the US’.”
As the US had been reducing its arsenal, Fu thus admitted to Ford that Beijing regarded its stockpile as a deterrent for other nuclear weapons, but also key for countering non-nuclear threats.

The assault, carried out by terrorists locally referred to as bandits, began Thursday night and continued into Friday morning, with attackers on motorcycles setting fire to buildings and shooting residents of the village of Tungan Dutse, who tried to flee
Hamisu Faru, a state lawmaker, confirmed the incident to Anadolu on Saturday.
“No one slept since Thursday and this morning. Some people lost three family members,” Faru told Anadolu.
The victims' bodies have been prepared for a mass burial, with corpses robed in white on Saturday. The number of abductees remains unclear, as local officials continue to account for the missing.
Nigeria's security situation is quite dire, especially in the country’s northwest, where Zamfara is located. The area has been plagued by bandit attacks, kidnappings, and killings, with thousands displaced and many more vulnerable.
The Nigerian government has taken some steps to address the issue. However, the situation remains challenging, with overlapping security threats from armed criminal gangs and rebel fighters.

Polish Sejm Marshal warns against viewing Putin’s camp as good-faith negotiators
This opinion was expressed in an interview with Ukrinform by the Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, commenting on the trilateral peace talks among Ukraine, the US, and Russia.
"Every real step toward a ceasefire is important. But we cannot pretend that Putin and his gang have suddenly become good-faith negotiators. Our position is clear: A ceasefire, sanctions pressure, and full sovereignty for Ukraine. In other words, a just peace is a situation in which the aggressor and the victim of aggression are clearly identified," Czarzasty emphasized.
The Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland believes that Europe must participate in the negotiation process. “Countries whose security is directly threatened cannot be mere observers,” he said.
Also, Czarzasty noted that he has no illusions about Moscow's goodwill.
"The issue of accountability cannot depend on Russia's consent. There are international mechanisms, including proceedings in international tribunals, designed to ensure that crimes do not go unpunished. History teaches us that without accountability, there can be no lasting peace. This is the starting point. The ruling coalition in Poland, of which I am a part, understands this well. This is our next common Polish-Ukrainian interest," concluded the Marshal of the Sejm.
As reported by Ukrinform, Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Ukraine is striving to ensure that the next round of trilateral negotiations yields positive results.
On February 18, trilateral negotiations among Ukraine, the United States, and Russia concluded in Geneva.

Afghanistan vows ‘appropriate and measured response’ to Pakistani strikes
Defense Ministry says attacks in Paktika, Nangarhar violate sovereignty, international law; accuses Pakistani military of repeated aggression, intelligence failures
ISTANBUL
The Defense Ministry of Afghanistan said Sunday it would meet the reported Pakistani strikes on its soil with an “appropriate and measured response” at a “suitable time.”
The ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest possible terms" on US social media company X, describing them as a clear violation of national sovereignty, international law, principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values.
It said targeting civilian and religious centers demonstrates the Pakistani military’s intelligence and security shortcomings, and "such repeated acts of aggression will never be able to conceal their internal shortcomings.
Pakistani forces reportedly carried out airstrikes in several areas of eastern and southeastern Afghanistan, according to Afghan media and the Pakistani Ministry of Information.
“Pakistan in a retributive response, has carried out intelligence based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and its affiliates and Islamic State of Khorsan Province (ISKP) at the border region,” the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting wrote on X early Sunday.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombings in Pakistan, it said.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates the Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” it added.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.

Hong Kong budget must be ‘prudent’, balance social needs and reserves: Paul Chan
Finance chief also reveals purple cover for 2026-27 budget, saying it symbolises Hong Kong’s economic growth amid external volatility
Hong Kong must exercise fiscal prudence, carefully weighing social needs while maintaining adequate reserves to guard against unforeseen circumstances, the finance chief has said as he outlined the principles of the budget he will deliver on Wednesday.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po on Sunday also revealed the purple cover for the 2026-27 budget, saying the colour symbolised Hong Kong’s strengthening economic momentum amid a volatile external environment.
The remarks came as the city braced for more global trade uncertainties, with US President Donald Trump announcing on Saturday his decision to raise a temporary global tariff on all imports to the country from 10 to 15 per cent with immediate effect. His move followed a US Supreme Court ruling against his earlier sweeping emergency duties.
“Facing a volatile external environment and uncertainties in the process of economic transformation, we must manage our finances prudently, consider the short, medium and long-term needs of society, and maintain a certain level of reserves to deal with any unforeseen circumstances that may arise,” Chan said in his weekly blog.
The minister said the current administration had been striving to boost the economy, pursue development and improve people’s livelihoods in a way that was “consistent” with residents’ expectations.
He cautioned that the path towards these goals and the allocation of resources often faced real-world constraints, saying the government must inevitably prioritise and make “difficult trade-offs” when drafting the city’s budget blueprint.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Ukraine struck an oil depot in Russian-occupied Luhansk overnight on Feb. 22, Telegram news channel Exilenova+ reported.
A strong fire erupted at the facility overnight as a result of strikes and continued to burn into the morning, the outlet reported, citing local residents.
Kyiv regularly strikes deep within Russia and the occupied territories of Ukraine in an effort to diminish the Kremlin's fighting power.
Ukraine considers Moscow's energy sites military targets as they fund Russia's war against Ukraine.
In Russia's Udmurt Republic, Ukraine's military launched an overnight operation, striking the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a key missile production hub with long-range cruise Flamingo missiles, Ukraine's Armed Forces General Staff confirmed on Feb. 21.
Overnight Feb. 18-19, Ukraine reportedly struck an oil depot in Russia's Pskov Oblast and launched missiles at the Russian city of Belgorod, causing power outages in parts of the city, Telegram news channels and local authorities reported.
A source from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent that the attack on the oil depot in Velikiye Luki was the work of their "Alpha" Unmanned Aerial Vehicle unit, which managed to make their way through the anti-drone nets spread over the facility.
"Such operations are an element of systematic weakening of the military potential of the Russian Federation," the SBU source wrote in a statement.
Ukraine successfully attacked a Russian drone warehouse in occupied Luhansk Oblast on Jan. 19, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported.

“Sources told TOLOnews that following the airstrikes in Khogyani district, Nangarhar province, Pakistani forces also carried out strikes in the province’s Ghani Khel district, Nangarhar province and Behsud district, Nangarhar province,” the Afghan news channel wrote on US social media platform X.
“Sources add that in Behsud district, the home of a civilian identified as Shahabuddin was targeted. Pakistani forces also conducted airstrikes tonight in Barmal district, Paktika province and Urgun district, Paktika province,” it added.

Iran has designated the armed forces of European Union member states as “terrorist entities” in a tit-for-tat move.

It noted that Iran decided to designate all naval and air forces of EU member states “terrorist organizations.”
- Trump to raise global import tariff from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump escalated his renewed tariff campaign by pledging to raise a previously announced 10% global tariff to 15%, even after the Supreme Court ruled against his previous tariff hikes.
"Based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday ... by the United States Supreme Court," the global tariff will be raised to 15% "effective immediately," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
- Arab countries condemn US ambassador’s remarks supporting Israel’s control over Middle East
Arab countries strongly condemned as “absurd and provocative,” unacceptable, and contrary to international law, the remarks by US Ambassador to Tel Aviv Mike Huckabee, in which he openly accepted Israel’s control over the entire Middle East, including the occupied West Bank.
Huckabee argued on a podcast that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying, “It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
He made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.

Esmaeil Baghaei, spokesperson for Iran’s Foreign Ministry, condemned remarks by Mike Huckabee, the US envoy to occupied Palestine, arguing that Israel could expand its territory across the region from the Nile to the Euphrates.
Baghaei described the comments as evidence of US participation in Israel’s expansionist policies and actions against Palestinians.
"Mike Huckabee's postulation that ‘It would be fine' if Israel 'took it all,’ and expand from the Nile to the Euphrates, is a bold testament to American active complicity in Israeli regime's expansionist wars of aggression as well as its colonial genocide of Palestinians," Baghaei wrote on X.
"The Islamic Republic of Iran condemns, along with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), 'such extremist ideological rhetoric' that would only further embolden the occupying regime to persist in its atrocity crimes and illegal measures against Palestinians as well as its constant aggression against the nations of the region," the senior Iranian diplomat stressed.

Man on leave absconds from troubled hospital days after two escapees allegedly kill people
A psychiatric inpatient on “approved leave” has absconded from a Sydney hospital just three days after the state’s mental health minister initiated an urgent review into its security in response to the escape of two patients who allegedly killed people in separate incidents last week.
Madan Pandey, 25, was an inpatient at Cumberland Hospital when he absconded on Saturday morning.
“Western Sydney Local Health District notified police when a patient did not return to Cumberland Hospital. The patient was taking approved leave from the hospital and did not return at the planned time,” the district said in a statement on Sunday evening.
Mental Health Minister Rose Jackson said the planned leave “following an assessment by a senior psychiatrist” was part of Pandey’s recovery process.
“A formal review into the security protocols at Cumberland Hospital is under way. We will thoroughly investigate any process failures and if systematic failures of leadership or culture become clear, I will not hesitate to take action to resolve,” she said.
Police, who hold concerns for Pandey’s welfare, have begun investigating.
Setefano Mooniai Leaaetoa, 25, was arrested after an alleged rampage with a kitchen knife in Merrylands last Tuesday. One man died, and another man and a woman were severely wounded.
Leaaetoa was charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder. He had been an involuntary patient at Cumberland and escaped his escorts during a transfer to Westmead Hospital for medical care on February 7.
Another Cumberland patient, Luke Peter Francis, absconded from one of Cumberland’s locked wards by allegedly threatening a nurse and swiping her access card, before stealing a car in Hurstville on Sunday. The 31-year-old had been released from prison on parole days earlier.
Francis was allegedly driving the stolen Toyota Camry when it crashed into another car during a police pursuit. Two women, driver Lee Casuscelli, 60, and her passenger, Maureen Crosland, 84, died at the scene.
NSW Premier Chris Minns on Thursday said the growing pressure on the public mental health system needed to be addressed, including by implementing recommendations from the Bondi Junction stabbings inquest.
Minns signalled his concerns about the security failings, saying “there needs to be a full investigation into the circumstances relating to these patients”.
“Absconding is common,” said Nick Howson, a mental health clinical nurse consultant and the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association Cumberland branch delegate for mental health.
Cumberland staff would call local police “once a fortnight on average” about absconding patients who were a risk, most often to themselves, he said.
In February 2025, staff said extremely unwell involuntary patients were waiting days on Cumberland’s locked wards to see a specialist at the height of a psychiatrist workforce crisis.
Senior psychiatrists who resigned from Cumberland in 2025 have been replaced by fewer, more junior, part-time psychiatrists.
Jackson initiated an urgent review into Cumberland’s security protocols, and NSW Health will conduct a review of Leaaetoa’s care with the assistance of an external senior psychiatrist.

Blizzard warnings send East Coast scrambling to prepare for heavy snow and strong winds
Emergency officials in New York City, New Jersey, Boston and communities along the East Coast are rushing to prepare for an intense winter storm, forecast to arrive Sunday
- Bookmark
Cities and towns along the East Coast scrambled to prepare for a bout with heavy snow and damaging winds after forecasters issued blizzard alerts for communities from Maryland to Massachusetts.
The National Weather Service warned that once the storm intensifies Sunday it could prove significantly more severe than projections made just a few days ago.
The weather service said 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow was possible in many areas as it put out blizzard warnings for New York City and Long Island, Boston and coastal communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, it said.
“While we do get plenty of these nor'easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it's been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service's Weather Prediction Center.
Snell said the storm would arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston in the evening.
Some of the heaviest snow was projected to fall overnight Sunday into Monday.
The weather service said the storm could begin as rainfall in some places before worsening. Some of the heaviest snow is projected to fall overnight Sunday, with as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour at times in some areas, before tapering off by Monday afternoon.
The weather service warned that the storm, with gusts up to 55 mph (80 kph), could cause whiteout conditions that “will make travel treacherous and potentially life-threatening. The strong winds and weight of snow on tree limbs may down power lines and could cause sporadic power outages.”
Officials scrambled to prepare for a storm that forecasters days ago believed would have a much more limited impact.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city would expand on efforts it used to deal with a major snowfall weeks ago. But officials held off on deciding whether to open schools Monday for the time being.
“We saw on Friday there was expectation that the likelihood was that we were going to face maybe 3 to 4 inches of snow. Quickly that then changed,” Mamdani said. “So we want to make sure that we make a decision based on up-to-date and accurate information.”
New York brought in additional snow-clearing equipment from outside the city and planned to increase use of geocoding to keep track of bus stops and crosswalks that need clearing, he said.
With the storm zeroing in, John Berlingieri scrapped plans for a family trip to Puerto Rico to prepare his company, Berrington Snow Management, for what could well be a mammoth task: Clearing snow from millions of square feet of asphalt surrounding shopping malls and industrial parks across Long Island.
Employees spent the last few days recharging batteries on the company’s 40 front-end loaders and replacing windshield wipers on snow-removal vehicles, before resting up Saturday.
“I’m anticipating at least one week of work around the clock,” Berlingieri said. “We’re going to work 24 to 36 hours straight, sleep for a few hours and then go back.”
The storm approached just as the icy remains of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks earlier were finally melting away.
Officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off the streets, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.
“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that,” said Scott Evans, the city's fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it's too late. So therefore please stay at home.”
Many churches canceled Sunday services and other activities. To compensate, St. Veronica Parish in Howell, New Jersey, added an extra Mass on Saturday evening.
“Please stay safe, avoid unnecessary travel, and keep one another in prayer during the storm,” the Rev. Peter James Alindogan posted online.

Pakistan launches strikes in Afghanistan, ‘dozens’ killed and wounded, Kabul says
Pakistan launched multiple cross-border strikes targeting "terrorist training camps and hideouts" in eastern Afghanistan, the information ministry said Sunday. Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens" of civilians, including women and children, were killed and wounded as tensions between the two countries escalated at the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

Pakistan said Sunday it launched multiple air strikes targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
The overnight attacks were the most extensive since border clashes in October killed more than 70 people on both sides and wounded hundreds.
Read morePakistan and Afghanistan trade heavy fire along border, officials say
Islamabad said it hit seven sites along the border region targeting Afghanistan-based militant groups "in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan".
The statement said Pakistan carried out "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State (IS) group's regional affiliate.
Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded" when strikes hit a madrasa and homes in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.
An AFP journalist in Nangarhar's Bihsud district said residents from around the remote and mountainous area joined rescuers in one village, using a digger and shovels to search for bodies under the rubble.
"People here are ordinary people. The residents of this village are our relatives. When the bombing happened, one person who survived was shouting for help," said neighbour Amin Gul Amin, 37.
Nangarhar police told AFP the bombardment started at around midnight and hit three districts.
"Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out," said police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad.
'Calculated response'
Afghanistan's defence ministry said it will "deliver an appropriate and calculated response" to the Pakistani strikes.
The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.
Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians between October and December, according to the UN mission in Afghanistan.
Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.
Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.
The deteriorating relationship has hit people in both countries, with the land border largely shut for months.
Pakistan said Sunday that despite repeated urging by Islamabad, the Taliban authorities have failed to act against militant groups using Afghan territory to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
The Afghan government has denied harbouring militants.
Islamabad launched the strikes after a suicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other such attacks more recently in northwestern Pakistan.
The IS group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, which killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack in Islamabad since 2008.
The militant group's regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a Kabul restaurant last month.

“Sources told TOLOnews that following the airstrikes in Khogyani district, Nangarhar province, Pakistani forces also carried out strikes in the province’s Ghani Khel district, Nangarhar province and Behsud district, Nangarhar province,” the Afghan news channel wrote on US social media platform X.
It further said: “Sources add that in Behsud district, the home of a civilian identified as Shahabuddin was targeted. Pakistani forces also conducted airstrikes tonight in Barmal district, Paktika province and Urgun district, Paktika province.”
The outlet, citing security sources, reported that no casualties were recorded in the strikes on Barmal and Urgun districts.
In the channel’s Pashtu version it said that a religious sermon was struck in the Barmal district in Paktika.
In a separate post, TOLOnews said, "The Pakistani military has confirmed carrying out strikes on Afghan territory, claiming that seven hideouts belonging to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) were targeted."
It cited Nangarhar Police spokesperson Sayed Tayyeb Hammad who said 23 members of a family were trapped under the rubble after a civilian home was hit in the Behsud district. Four people have been rescued, with search and rescue operations ongoing.
Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, wrote Sunday on X, “Certain Pakistani military circles have once again violated Afghan territory."
“Last night, they bombed our civilian compatriots in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, martyring and injuring dozens of people, including women and children," he said. "Pakistani generals are compensating for security weaknesses in their own country through such crimes.”
“Pakistan in a retributive response, has carried out intelligence based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban of Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and its affiliates and Islamic State of Khorsan Province (ISKP) at the border region,” Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said on X early Sunday.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan it said.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” the ministry added.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.
No confirmed information has been released so far regarding possible casualties.

From abdication to Diana, Harry and ex-Prince Andrew. A look at major British royal scandals
Britain’s monarchy faces fresh strain as police investigate the former Prince Andrew over alleged misconduct as a former trade envoy
- Bookmark
Holding prestige but not power, Britain’s monarchy is finely tuned to public sentiment.
That's been evident with the disgrace of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the former prince who was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Police are investigating whether Mountbatten-Windsor shared confidential trade information with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when the then-Prince Andrew was a U.K. trade envoy. The arrest is unrelated to allegations related to Epstein’s sex trafficking.
Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his association with Epstein but has not commented on the most recent allegations, which stem from the release of millions of pages of Epstein files by the U.S. Justice Department.
For King Charles III, his younger brother's travails have overshadowed almost everything during his reign, now in its fourth year.
The king, who is also contending with an unspecified form of cancer, has to ensure that it is business as usual. The institution requires nothing less.
But the continuing investigations into Mountbatten-Windsor, the image of him slouched in the back of his chauffeur-driven car, seemingly shocked and confused, will not be easy to dislodge.
The king is doing his best to insulate the monarchy from any further scandals relating to Andrew and his connections with Epstein, who took his own life in a New York jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
He has stripped Andrew of all his titles and honors and banished him from his mansion near Windsor Castle. Now, the king says, the law "must take its course.’’
Where that course leads, nobody knows. For the British monarchy, it's potentially a crisis as grave as any it has experienced since its current iteration — the House of Windsor — was born more than a century ago.
World War I
The House of Windsor was born out of conflict.
The royal families of Europe are intertwined, and Britain’s is heavily German, especially after Queen Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, with whom she had nine children.
When Britain and Germany went to war in 1914, some members of the wider British royal family found themselves on opposing sides.
Britain’s King George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in 1917, and initiated legislation to strike out the titles of princes and lords who had backed the Germans.
One target was Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who was a U.K. royal and also a prince of Hanover. His title was removed for being an enemy of Britain under the 1917 act, which was enacted in 1919, once the war was over.
According to the House of Commons Library, “this was the first and only time such a title has been removed in this way.”
Mountbatten-Windsor is no longer a prince or Duke of York, but remains eighth in line to the throne. The current British government said Friday it is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession to the crown.
The abdication
The relationship between Edward, Prince of Wales, and U.S. socialite Wallis Simpson was a headache that turned into a constitutional crisis. Simpson was twice divorced, and Edward, the heir to the throne, was destined to be ceremonial head of the Church of England, which did not allow divorced people to remarry in church.
The prince became King Edward VIII when his father King George V died in early 1936. He continued to say he wanted to marry Simpson, despite the opposition of the British government.
Forced to choose between duty and passion, he gave up the throne in December 1936, announcing in a radio broadcast that “I have found it impossible ... to discharge my duties as king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love.”
The news was a surprise to many in Britain, though not beyond it. British newspapers had not reported on the relationship, and American magazines had offending articles cut out before going on sale.
The abdication set the monarchy on a new course. Edward’s younger brother took the throne as King George VI. He was succeeded by his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, and after her 70-year reign by her son, King Charles III. All doubled down on the idea that the monarch’s primary attribute should be a sense of duty — something Edward, in the popular imagination, lacked.
Edward and Wallis, thereafter the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and suspected by some of Nazi sympathies, were sent to the Bahamas, where he served as governor. After the war they mostly stayed away from Britain, living a life of nomadic luxury.
Princess Diana's death
The death of Princess Diana — the ex-wife of Charles — in a car crash in Paris in 1997, at the age of 36, shocked the world and left her family, including sons William and Harry, then 15 and 12, in mourning.
The strength of public feeling caught the royal family by surprise. Mounds of floral tributes piled up outside the gates of Buckingham Palace and Diana’s home at Kensington Palace to mourn a princess who had been ostracized by the royal family after her divorce from Charles in 1992.
The queen was at Balmoral in Scotland on her summer holiday with her husband Prince Philip, Charles, William and Harry. The family kept their grief private and stuck to routine — taking the ashen-faced boys to church on Sunday morning — and the queen did not issue a statement for several days.
She was advised to make a public display of grief by Prime Minister Tony Blair, who perfectly caught the public mood with his own tribute calling Diana “the people’s princess.”
After newspaper headlines urging “Speak to us Ma’am,” and “Show us you care,” the queen made a live televised address to the nation on the eve of Diana’s funeral.
“What I say to you now, as your queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart,” the queen said, acknowledging the country’s grief, praising Diana and promising to cherish her memory.
The trouble with Harry
Not long ago, Andrew had been trying to regain favor with the family, benefiting indirectly from the trouble with Prince Harry.
Harry became estranged from his father and older brother, Prince William, heir to the throne, when he and his wife, Meghan, stepped down from their working roles and moved to California in 2020. The couple famously aired their grievances with the royal family in a tell-all interview to Oprah Winfrey and a revealing Netflix series. Harry then fueled the tensions by revealing personal conversations in his memoir, “Spare.”
Harry also broke from royal protocol in turning to the courts to sort out his legal problems. He became the first senior royal to testify in court in more than a century in his successful phone hacking lawsuit against the Daily Mirror.
A failed legal effort to restore his police protection detail that was stripped from him when he left royal work, though, was seen as an attack on his father’s government.
When the courts finally rejected the lawsuit, it provided a chance for a reunion between father and son. The two shared a cup of tea at Charles’ London abode, Clarence House, in September 2024. It was their first meeting in over a year.
It lasted less than an hour.

Sybiha stated that the missile hit one of the production buildings. Fortunately, there were no casualties.
The minister stressed that this is not a military facility, but an enterprise that has been operating since the 1990s, producing world-famous brands, providing jobs for Ukrainians, and contributing to the economies of Ukraine and the United States.
“When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe,” the foreign minister stated.
Moscow cannot speak about economic dialogue with the United States while attacking US-owned production facilities, he noted.
“Targeting peaceful industry is not warfare—it is deliberate economic terror. Accountability must follow,” Sybiha emphasized.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Ukrainian foreign minister said that Russia is deliberately striking American enterprises in Ukraine, with 47% of such companies affected during the full-scale war and 38% suffering casualties.

The US deported a gay asylum-seeker to a third country where homosexuality is illegal
A woman who sought asylum in the United States after fleeing a country where homosexuality is illegal says the Trump administration's third-country deportation system sent her to another one
- Bookmark
Being gay in Morocco is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison. But it was the violence from her family that forced Farah, a 21-year-old gay woman, to flee the country.
After a long journey to the United States and a third-country deportation by the Trump administration, however, Farah said she is now back in Morocco and in hiding.
“It is hard to live and work with the fear of being tracked once again by my family,” she told The Associated Press, in a rare testimony from a person deported via a third country despite having protection orders from a U.S. immigration judge. “But there is nothing I can do. I have to work.”
She asked to be identified by her first name only for fear of persecution. The AP saw her protection order and lawyers verified parts of her account.
Farah said that before she fled, she was beaten by her family and the family of her partner when they found out about their relationship. She was kicked out of the family home and fled with her partner to another city. She said her family found her and tried to kill her.
Through a friend, she and her partner heard about the opportunity to get visas for Brazil and fly there with the aim of reaching the United States, where they had friends. From Brazil, she trekked through six countries for weeks to reach the U.S. border, where they asked for asylum.
“You get put in situations that are truly horrible," she recalled. "When we arrived (at the U.S. border), it felt like it was worth the trouble and that we got to our goal."
They arrived in early 2025. But instead of finding the freedom to be herself, Farah said she was detained for almost a year, first in Arizona, then in Louisiana.
“It was very cold,” she said of detention. “And we only had very thin blankets.” Medical care was inadequate, she said.
She was denied asylum, but in August she received a protection order from an U.S. immigration judge, who ruled she cannot be deported to Morocco because that would endanger her life. Her partner, denied asylum and a protection order, was deported.
Farah said she was three days from a hearing on her release when she was handcuffed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and put on a plane to an African country she had never visited, and one where homosexuality is illegal: Cameroon. She was put in a detention facility.
“They asked me if I wanted to stay in Cameroon, and I told them that I can’t stay in Cameroon and risk my life in a place where I would still be endangered,” she said. She was flown to Morocco.
Most deportees had protection orders
She is one of dozens of people confirmed to be deported from the U.S. by the Trump administration to third countries despite having legal protection from U.S. immigration judges. The real number is unknown.
The administration has used third-country deportations to pressure migrants who are in the U.S. illegally to leave on their own, saying they could end up “in any number of third countries."
The detention facility in Cameroon's capital of Yaounde, where Farah was held, currently has 15 deportees from various African countries who arrived on two flights, and none is Cameroonian, according to lawyer Joseph Awah Fru, who represents them.
All nine deportees on the first flight in January, including Farah, had received a judge's protection orders, Fru said. He never met Farah but was aware of her case.
Another flight on Monday brought eight people. Two of them, a woman from Ghana and a woman from Congo, said they had protection orders, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Three freelance journalists reporting on the deportations to Cameroon for the AP were briefly detained there.
Deporting people to a third country where they could be sent home was effectively a legal “loophole,” said Alma David, an immigration lawyer with the U.S.-based Novo Legal Group who has helped deportees and verified Farah's case.
“By deporting them to Cameroon, and giving them no opportunity to contest being sent to a country whose government hoped to quietly send them back to the very countries where they face grave danger, the U.S. not only violated their due process rights but our own immigration laws, our obligations under international treaties and even DHS’ own procedures," David said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security earlier confirmed there were deportations to Cameroon in January.
“We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them. Period,” it said, and asserted that the third-country agreements “ensure due process under the U.S. Constitution.”
Asked about the deportations to Cameroon, the U.S. State Department on Friday told the AP it had “no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments." It did not reply to further questions.
Cameroon’s Foreign Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.
‘Impossible choices’
Farah was one of two women from the first group of deportees to return to Morocco.
“They were given two impossible choices,” David said, and asserted that claiming asylum was not clearly presented as one of them. “This was before the lawyer had access to them. They’d been alone there in that facility without any help from anybody or any indication that there was gonna be an option other than going back to their home countries.”
Fru said he has not been granted access to the deportees. He said the assistant to the country director for the International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-affiliated organization, told him he must apply to speak to them. Fru plans to do that Monday.
The IOM told the AP it was “aware of the removal of migrants from the United States of America to some African countries” and added that it “works with people facing difficult decisions about whether to return to their country of origin." It said its role is providing accurate information about options and ensuring that "anyone who chooses to return does so voluntarily.”
The IOM said the facility in Yaounde was managed by the authorities in Cameroon. It did not respond to further questions.
African nations are paid millions
Cameroon is one of at least seven African nations to receive deported third-country nationals in a deal with the U.S. Others include South Sudan, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
Some have received millions of dollars in return, according to documents released by the State Department. Details of other agreements, including the one with Cameroon, have not been released.
The Trump administration has spent at least $40 million to deport about 300 migrants to countries other than their own, according to a report released last week by the Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
According to internal administration documents reviewed by the AP, 47 third-country agreements are in various stages of negotiation.
In Morocco, Farah said it was hard to hear U.S. officials refer to people like her as a threat.
“The USA is built on immigration and by immigrant labor, so we’re clearly not all threats,” she said. “What was done to me was unfair. A normal deportation would have been fair, but to go through so much and lose so much, only to be deported in such a way, is cruel.”

Germany joins growing ranks of countries considering social media bans

Germany joins growing ranks of countries considering social media bans
Stuttgart: Germany’s ruling conservatives have passed a motion to ban social media use for under 14s and introduce more stringent digital verification checks for teenagers, building momentum for such limits in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
At a party conference in the city of Stuttgart, Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union also called for fines for online platforms that failed to enforce such limits, and European Union-wide harmonisation of age standards.
A growing number of countries, including Spain, Greece, France and Britain, are looking at similar social media bans or restrictions on accessing platforms like TikTok or Instagram.
It follows the example of Australia, which last year became the first country to force platforms to cut off access for children under 16.
European nations are more broadly ratcheting up pressure on social media companies, risking a backlash from the United States. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs and sanctions if EU countries impose new tech taxes or online regulations that hit US firms.
“We call on the federal government to introduce a legal age limit of 14 for the use of social networks and to address the special need for protection in the digital sphere up to the age of 16,” said the motion that passed on Saturday (German time).
Merz’s coalition partners the Social Democrats have also backed social media curbs for children. Pressure from both parties in the coalition makes it increasingly likely that the federal government will push for restrictions.
However, under Germany’s federal system, media regulation is a state-level responsibility and states must negotiate with each other to agree consistent nationwide rules.
Last week French President Emmanuel Macron said one of his priorities for the Group of Seven presidency will be protecting children from the harmful effects of social media and artificial intelligence, calling on countries like India to support the measures.
“There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world,” Macron said at the India AI Summit in New Delhi on Thursday. “One of our priorities during the G7 presidency will be children’s protection against AI and digital-related abuse.” France holds the rotating presidency of the G7 in 2026.
Macron highlighted France’s initiative to ban social media networks for children under 15.
Modi echoed Macron’s push to protect children online during his own address at the summit on Thursday. “We have to be more alert about children’s safety,” Modi said. “Like their schools’ syllabus is curated, AI space should be child safe and family-guided.”
India’s Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said last week that the government was holding discussions on “the right way to go forward” with possible age limits for social media and is also addressing the issue of deepfakes with platforms.

After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement

After 4 years of war by Russia in Ukraine, peace is still elusive despite a US push for a settlement
When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine surpassed 1,418 days last month, it officially exceeded a historic milestone — the same span of time it took Moscow to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II
- Bookmark
When Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine surpassed 1,418 days last month, it officially exceeded a historic milestone — the same span of time it took Moscow to defeat Nazi Germany in World War II.
And unlike the Red Army that pushed all the way to Berlin eight decades ago in what it called the Great Patriotic War, Russia's 4-year-old, all-out invasion of its neighbor is still struggling to fully capture Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland.
After Moscow failed to seize the capital of Kyiv and install a puppet government in February 2022, the conflict turned into trench warfare with tremendous cost. By some estimates, nearly 2 million soldiers are dead, wounded or missing on both sides in Europe’s most devastating conflict since World War II.
Russia has occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory since illegally annexing Crimea in 2014, but its gains after the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion have been slow. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte this month likened Moscow's advance to “the speed of a garden snail.”
Russian troops have moved only about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) into the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine in the past two years in a grinding battle for control of a few strongholds.
Despite the slow pace and high cost, President Vladimir Putin has maintained his maximalist demands in U.S.-mediated peace talks, saying Kyiv must pull its forces from the four Ukrainian regions that Moscow illegally annexed but never fully captured. He has repeatedly brandished his nuclear arsenal to prevent the West from boosting military support for Kyiv.
A war of attrition
Initially involving quick movements of large numbers of troops and tanks in Russia's opening blitz and Ukraine’s counteroffensive in fall 2022, the fighting morphed into bloody positional warfare along the 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) front line.
The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated Russian military casualties at 1.2 million, including 325,000 killed. It put Ukrainian troop casualties at up to 600,000, including up to 140,000 killed.
“Russia has suffered the highest casualty rate of any major power in any war since World War II, and its military has performed poorly, with historically slow rates of advance and little new territory to show for its efforts over the last two years,” it said, noting Russian troops were advancing an average of 70 meters (76 1/2 yards) a day in two years to capture the transport hub of Pokrovsk.
For the first time in military history, drones are playing a decisive role, making it effectively impossible for either side to covertly mass significant numbers of troops.
Since early in the conflict, Ukraine has relied on drones to offset Moscow's edge in firepower and stem its advances, but Russia has drastically expanded drone operations and introduced longer-range optical fiber-tethered drones to avoid electronic jamming. They widened the kill zone to 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from the front, leaving the terrain tangled in strands of filament.
The mixture of high-tech drones and World War I-style trench fighting has seen small groups of infantry — often just two or three soldiers — try to infiltrate enemy positions into towns flattened by Russian heavy artillery and glide bombs. Ferrying supplies and evacuating the wounded is a major challenge as drones target supply routes.
Long-range attacks
Ukrainian officials described this winter as the most challenging of the war. Russia exponentially increased its strikes on the country's energy system, causing blackouts in Kyiv where power supplies to many were cut to a few hours a day amid bitter cold.
Russia also has increasingly targeted power lines aiming to halt energy transfers and split Ukraine's power grid into isolated islands, increasing pressure on the grid.
Ukraine retaliated with long-range drone attacks on oil refineries and other energy facilities deep inside Russia, aiming to drain Moscow's export revenues.
Its drones and missiles sank several Russian warships in the Black Sea, forcing Moscow to redeploy its fleet from Russia-occupied Crimea to Novorossiysk. And in an audacious attack code-named “Spiderweb,” Ukraine used drones from trucks to hit several air bases hosting long-range bombers across Russia in June, a humiliating blow to the Kremlin.
US pressure, conflicting demands
U.S. President Donald Trump, who once promised to end the war in a day, has pushed to end the fighting, but mediation efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands.
Putin wants Ukraine to pull its troops from the part of the Donetsk region it still controls, abandon its bid to join NATO, curb its military and grant official status to the Russian language, among other demands Ukraine has rejected.
Russia left the door open to Kyiv's prospective European Union membership, but it firmly ruled out any European peacekeepers deployed to Ukraine as part of a settlement.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants a ceasefire along the existing line of contact, but Putin rules out a truce, demanding a comprehensive peace agreement.
“The territorial issue is important to the Kremlin, but the war has a more ambitious goal: to create a Ukraine that would be entirely within Russia’s sphere of influence and not perceived by Moscow as ‘anti-Russia,’” observed Tatiana Stanovaya of Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.
Ukraine and its allies accuse Putin of dragging out talks while he seizes more territory. The Kremlin accuses Kyiv and its European supporters of trying to undermine a tentative agreement reached by Trump and Putin at their Alaska summit.
While sticking to their positions, Putin and Zelenskyy have praised U.S. mediation and tried to curry favor with Trump.
After a disastrous White House meeting a year ago, Zelenskyy has adopted a more practical negotiating stance, emphasizing Ukraine’s goodwill.
After Trump called for a presidential election in Ukraine, Zelenskyy signaled readiness for it even though it’s banned under martial law. The election could be coupled with a referendum on a peace deal, he said, but insisted the vote was only possible once a ceasefire is established and Ukraine gets security guarantees from the U.S. and other allies.
Elusive settlement
Zelenskyy said the White House has set a June deadline for the war's end and will likely pressure both sides to meet it. But even as Trump appears eager for a peace deal before the U.S. midterm elections, challenges remain.
With Putin insisting on Ukraine’s pullback from Donetsk and Zelenskyy ruling it out, a quick deal appears unlikely. Zelenskyy also expressed skepticism about a compromise U.S. proposal to turn the eastern region into a free economic zone.
The Kremlin expects its attacks eventually will force Kyiv to accept Moscow’s terms. Ukraine hopes it can hold on until Trump loses patience and increases sanctions on Russia, forcing Putin to halt his aggression. But Trump often appears to be losing patience with Zelenskyy instead.
The war and Western sanctions have increasingly strained Russia’s economy. Growth has slowed to a near halt, due to persistent inflation and labor shortages. The latest U.S. sanctions on Russian oil exports have added to the strain.
But even with the economic challenges, Russia's defense plants have increased weapons output and its government has shielded key social groups like soldiers and industrial workers from hardship.
“Its economy is poorer, less efficient and less promising than it might otherwise have been,” wrote Richard Connolly of the Royal United Services Institute. “But it remains capable of sustaining the war. Its elites are more dependent on the regime, not less. Its political system is insulated from the transmission of economic discontent into pressure for regime change.”

Homeland Security suspends TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is suspending the TSA PreCheck and Global Entry airport security programs as a partial government shutdown continues.
The programs are designed to help speed registered travelers through security lines. Suspending them could cause headaches for fliers.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement that “shutdowns have serious real world consequences.” She also said that “TSA and CBP are prioritizing the general traveling population at our airports and ports of entry and suspending courtesy and special privilege escorts.”
The partial government shutdown began Feb. 14 after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach a deal on legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have been demanding changes to immigration operations that are core to President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.
Democrats on the House Committee on Homeland Security criticized the decision about airport security.
They said on social media that the administration was “kneecapping the programs that make travel smoother and secure” and accused them of “ruining your travel on purpose.”

Trump ‘curious’ why Iran hasn’t capitulated, Witkoff says

Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, said Saturday that Trump is questioning why Iran has not agreed to a deal on its nuclear program.
In an interview with Fox News, Witkoff told Lara Trump, the president’s daughter-in-law, that Trump is “curious” about Iran’s position.
“He's curious as to why they haven't ... I don't want to use the word capitulated, but why they haven't capitulated,” Witkoff said.
He added that Trump is asking why, “under this sort of pressure with the amount of naval power that we have over there,” Iran has not approached the United States to state it does not seek a nuclear weapon and outline what it is prepared to do.
Witkoff said Trump’s red lines require Iran to maintain “zero enrichment” of uranium. He added that Iran has enriched uranium beyond levels needed for civilian purposes.
The interview came as Trump has called on Iran to reach a nuclear agreement while maintaining a US military presence in the Middle East in case diplomacy fails.
On Friday, Trump urged Iran to “better negotiate a fair deal.” He also cited a figure of 32,000 protesters killed in Iran, a number advanced by Iranian opposition groups that is significantly higher than other estimates.

During the call, the two officials exchanged views on the current trajectory of the diplomatic process and regional developments linked to the negotiations.
Both sides emphasized the importance of constructive interaction and the use of dialogue as a mechanism to advance negotiations and achieve a sustainable understanding.
The discussion reflects ongoing coordination between Tehran and the UN nuclear watchdog amid broader diplomatic efforts concerning Iran’s nuclear file.

Eight bodies recovered in Libya, Greece as Mediterranean death toll rises
Bodies of five asylum seekers wash ashore in Libya as three others die in a separate incident off the coast of Greece.
Police in Libya have recovered the bodies of five asylum seekers that washed ashore near the capital, Tripoli, as authorities in Greece announced the deaths of three others in a separate incident off the coast of Crete.
The bodies in Libya were found on Saturday by residents of the coastal town of Qasr al-Akhyar, according to a police officer.

Hassan al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr al-Akhyar police station, told the Reuters news agency that the bodies were all of “dark-skinned people”. Two of them were women.
He said people in the area had reported seeing a child’s body wash ashore before the waves returned it to sea.
“We reported to the Red Crescent to recover the bodies,” said Ghawil. “The bodies we found are still intact, and we think there are more bodies to wash ashore.”
The tragedy came as Greek authorities were responding to a separate incident in the eastern Mediterranean.
The Athens News Agency reported on Saturday that authorities had recovered three bodies and rescued at least 20 people after a wooden boat carrying migrants and asylum seekers capsized off the coast of Crete.
Most of the survivors were Egyptians and Sudanese people, the agency reported. They also included four minors.
According to the Greek public broadcaster ERT, the wooden boat capsized when passengers were trying to climb up the ladders during a rescue effort involving a commercial ship.
The search for survivors was continuing with four patrol boats, an aircraft, and two ships from the European border agency Frontex, a spokesperson for the Greek coastguard told the AFP news agency.
According to ERT, survivors said about 50 people had been on board the wooden boat.
A second boat carrying about 40 migrants and asylum seekers was spotted in the area, leading to another rescue operation.
The deaths come after the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on February 9 that some 53 migrants, including two babies, were dead or missing after a rubber boat carrying 55 people capsized off the coast of Zuwara city.
In January alone, the IOM said, at least 375 migrants were reported dead or missing following multiple “invisible” shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean due to extreme weather, with hundreds more deaths believed to be unrecorded.
“These repeated incidents underscore the persistent and deadly risks faced by migrants and refugees attempting the dangerous crossing,” the group said.
Thousands of people attempt the perilous crossing from Libya to Europe over the Mediterranean every year. Libya has become a transit route for people fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe since the fall in 2011 of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.
Last week, a United Nations report said migrants in Libya, including young girls, are at risk of being killed, tortured, raped or put into domestic slavery, and called for a moratorium on the return of migrant boats to the country until human rights are ensured.
Many of the migrants and asylum seekers departing Libya seek to arrive in Crete, the gateway to the European Union.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 16,770 people seeking asylum in Europe arrived in Crete in 2025.
Faced with the surge in arrivals, the conservative Greek government suspended the processing of asylum applications for three months last summer, particularly for those arriving from Libya.
The UNHCR says 107 people died or went missing in Greek waters in 2025.

Thailand moves to cut sugar in popular drinks amid health drive

A crowd of customers, holding phones aloft, watch intently as Auntie Nid mixes up her bestseller: an iced Thai tea.
Condensed milk is poured into a glass, followed by three heaped tablespoons of sugar, and then freshly strained tea. The end product – a deep orange, creamy treat – is poured into a plastic bag filled with ice.
“I want to spoil my customers,” says Auntie Nid, 68, who prefers to be known by her nickname.
The Thai government, however, is trying to reduce the amount of sugar added to the country’s most popular drinks.
This month, nine of the country’s major coffee chains committed to halving the amount of sugar that is considered “normal sweetness” in some of their drinks as part of a new campaign to reset people’s taste buds and improve public health.
Thai people consume an average of 21 teaspoons of sugar a day – far more than the World Health Organization’s recommended daily limit of six teaspoons.
Sugary drinks are a major culprit, with Thailand historically being one of Asia’s biggest consumers of calories from sweetened drinks.
Thailand has taken other steps to tackle sugar, including a sugar tax, which was introduced gradually from 2017, with the last phase rolled out last year. This targets pre-packaged sugary drinks.
The tax has helped, said Pojjana Hunchangsith, assistant professor at Mahidol University. “One of the biggest impacts has been product reformulation, with many manufacturers lowering sugar levels to avoid higher tax rate,” she said.
However, the tax does not affect street vendors or cafes, where menus are packed with a dazzling array of sweet options – from boba milk teas and iced cocoa, to lemon tea and pink milk, a Thai drink made from sala syrup. “They are very important sources of sugar intake in Thailand,” Pojjana added, but freshly made drinks are far more difficult to regulate.
The latest government initiative will include some of the country’s biggest cafe chains. Many shops already display cards offering customers different levels of sweetness: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. Under the new campaign, for certain drinks, 100% sweetness will be half as sugary as it once was.
Ann Thumthong, 55, a taxi driver in Bangkok, welcomes the measures, saying it is difficult to avoid sweet things when buying food and drinks.
It is possible to retrain your sweetness preferences so you need less sugar, Thumthong said, adding that she has become more health conscious with age. “For me, in the past, when I finished the meal I went straight for the desert, but now I opt for fruits instead,” she said.
Phumsith Mahasuweerachai, associate professor at the faculty of economics in Khon Kaen University, said it was possible to encourage customers to make better choices even with simple adjustments. He conducted a study, which found that simply giving customers the option to choose how sweet their drinks would be prompted them to opt for less sugary drinks. Providing calorie information did not significantly change their choices, he added.
“If we don’t nudge [customers] or prompt them, it’s difficult for them to make the change,” he said. “They go to the coffee shop and it’s automatic.”
At Auntie Nid’s shop, customer Phakamas, 39, has just bought an iced cocoa on her lunch break, a relief in the Bangkok heat.
“I think consuming sugar is OK, I don’t consume it very frequently – I might consume a cup or two during the week,” she says.
Auntie Nid, whose shop has served teas and coffees in Bangkok’s old town for 30 years, can’t comprehend changing her recipe.
“No, no, no,” she says, as a queue of tourists, as well as some locals workers and students stretches out the door. The shop has always been popular, she says, but has become especially famous among foreign visitors thanks to social media.
“The reasons why these drinks are popular is because of their strong, intense taste,” she says. “Without sugar, the coffee and tea will be bland and bitter.”

Pakistan’s military has carried out air strikes in Afghanistan, targeting what it called “camps and hideouts” belonging to armed groups behind a spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad.
Taliban's Ministry of Defence condemned Sunday’s attacks, arguing they “hit a religious school and residential homes” in the border provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, “resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries, including women and children”.
Afghan sources told Al Jazeera that at least 17 people were killed in Nangarhar.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in a statement on X that the country’s military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps and hideouts belonging to the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates.
It said Pakistan has repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban government to take action to prevent armed groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks, but that Kabul has failed to “undertake any substantive action”.

Peace in Europe possible only with Russia’s participation — Germany’s ruling AfD party

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. Co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) Alice Weidel stated that peace in Europe is possible only in cooperation with Russia and called the current approach to relations with Moscow erroneous.
She has landed sharp criticism regarding the foreign policy rhetoric voiced by the current German government as part of the CDU/CSU and SPD bloc.
"I have no clue which course the federal government of Germany pursues, but it is definitely not a peaceful one," she said. "As an Alternative for Germany, we want harmonious relations with our neighbors and with our European partners. And that's what we stand for."
Weidel stressed that the Gernam political party of Alternative for Germany strives to reach mutual understanding with its partners.
"We seek a dialogue, an exchange of opinions, and a certain level of communication both with the United States and Russia," she continued. "It is because that peace in Europe is possible only with Russia, not without it"
"That is why we have always considered the current approach to relations with Russia to be erroneous," Weidel added.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that President Vladimir Putin has never refused from direct contacts and if German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron want this, all they have to do is just call.
Trilateral talks on Ukraine involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine were held in Geneva on February 17 and 18. On the first day, they lasted about six hours, on the second about two. Head of the Russian delegation presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky described the negotiations as difficult, but businesslike. According to him, a new meeting on the Ukrainian settlement will be held soon.
The first round was held in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24, followed by the second round on February 4-5.

Stars descend on the BAFTA film awards, with 'One Battle' and 'Sinners' leading the race
The BAFTA Film Awards have a tight race, with “One Battle After Another” and “Sinners” leading the nominations
- Bookmark
TO MOVE AT 0500GMT SUNDAY
Politically charged thriller “One Battle After Another” and blues-steeped epic “Sinners” lead the race for Sunday’s British Academy Film Awards as the two movies jostle for awards-season supremacy.
Oddsmakers suggest Shakespearean family tragedy “Hamnet” could beat them to best picture if British film industry voters respond to the emotionally rich story, earthy English setting and intense performances of Chloé Zhao’s adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s historical novel.
“One Battle” has 14 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for five of its cast. “Sinners” is just behind with 13, while “Hamnet” and the ping-pong odyssey “Marty Supreme” each have 11 nominations.
Guillermo del Toro’s reimagining of “Frankenstein” and Norwegian family drama “ Sentimental Value” each got eight nominations.
The British prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards, often provide hints about who will win at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, held this year on March 15. In the Oscar nominations, “Sinners” leads the race with a record 16 nominations, followed by “One Battle After Another” with 13.
Stars including Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy, Glenn Close and Ethan Hawke are expected on the red carpet outside London’s Royal Festival Hall before a black-tie ceremony hosted by Scottish actor Alan Cumming.
Cumming, who hosts the U.S. version of reality show “The Traitors,” pledged to strike a “balance between celebration and mischief.”
The BAFTA best film nominees are “One Battle After Another,” “Hamnet,” “Marty Supreme,” “Sinners” and “Sentimental Value.” The BAFTAs also have a distinctly British accent, with a separate category for best British film. Its 10 nominees include “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” “Pillion,” “I Swear” and “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy.”
Directing contenders are Paul Thomas Anderson for “One Battle,” Josh Safdie for “Marty Supreme,” Ryan Coogler for “Sinners,” Yorgos Lanthimos for dystopian tragicomedy “Bugonia,” Joachim Trier for “Sentimental Value” and Zhao for “Hamnet.” Zhao will be the first female director to win two BAFTAs if she takes the prize. She won the directing award in 2021 for “Nomadland.”
Best leading actor nominees are bookies’ favorite Timothée Chalamet for “Marty Supreme,” Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another,” Ethan Hawke for Broadway biopic “Blue Moon,” Michael B. Jordan for “Sinners,” Jesse Plemons for “Bugonia” and Robert Aramayo for playing a man with Tourette’s syndrome in biographical drama “I Swear.”
The leading actress category includes the strongly favored Jessie Buckley for her performance as Agnes Hathaway, wife of William Shakespeare, in “Hamnet.” She’s up against Rose Byrne for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” Kate Hudson for “Song Sung Blue,” Chase Infiniti for “One Battle After Another,” Renate Reinsve for “Sentimental Value” and Emma Stone for “Bugonia.”
“One Battle” actors Teyana Taylor, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn are all nominated for supporting performances.
The Associated Press was recognized in the best documentary category with a nomination for Mstyslav Chernov’s harrowing Ukraine war portrait “2000 Meters to Andriivka, ” co-produced by the AP and Frontline PBS.
Most BAFTA winners are chosen by 8,500 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals. Contenders for the Rising Star award – the only prize decided by public vote and a reliable picker of future A-listers – are Infiniti, Aramayo, “Sinners” star Miles Caton and British actors Archie Madekwe and Posy Sterling.
Donna Langley, the U.K.-born chairwoman of NBCUniversal Entertainment, will be awarded the British Academy’s highest honor, the BAFTA fellowship.
The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom starting at 1900GMT (2 p.m. EST) and on E! in the U.S. at 2000EST.

Trump says sending 'great hospital boat' to Greenland

Trump says sending 'great hospital boat' to Greenland
February 22, 2026US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.
He said the boat would treat many "sick" people in the island.
Trump did not provide any additional details about who he was referring to or the number of people the boat would help.
"We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
"It's on the way!!!," he added.
Denmark's defense minister responded to the statement on Sunday, saying Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries.
What else did Denmark say?
"The Greenlandic population receives the health care it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialized treatment, they receive it in Denmark," Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR.
"So it's not as if there's a need for a special health care initiative in Greenland."
There are five regional hospitals in Greenland, with a hospital in the capital Nuuk serving patients from across the territory.
Access to health care is free in Greenland and in Denmark.
Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the US hospital ship's possible arrival.
"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.
Danish Arctic Command evacuates US submariner
Trump's post on Saturday came after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a US submarine crew member who required urgent medical attention.
The submarine was in Greenland's waters, seven nautical miles outside of Nuuk.
It was not clear if Trump's post about sending a hospital ship was connected in any way to the evacuation.
Trump's Greenland push ratchets up tensions
The announcement, however, gains significance amid a deep rift between the Trump administration and Europe over control of the territory.
Greenland, the world's largest island, is a mineral-rich, strategically important Arctic territory. It is self-governing but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Trump says the island is crucial for US national security and that he wants to acquire it. He previously even threatened to seize it by force if necessary.
The rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between Washington and its European NATO allies.
Greenland, Denmark and the US have engaged in talks to resolve the situation.
Trump dialed back his threats after reaching a "framework" deal with NATO chief Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence over Greenland.
Earlier this week, Denmark's King Frederik X visited Greenland.
It was his second visit to the island in a year, an attempt to demonstrate unity with the territory in the face of Trump's push to acquire control of the vast island.

AI agent invasion has people trying to pick winners
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK – An onslaught of artificial intelligence agents that handle tasks from writing code to dispensing tax advice has the tech world and financial markets scrambling to pick winners and shed losers.
Gone are the days of being satisfied with OpenAI’s ChatGPT simply creating responses to text prompts.
Makers of leading AI models have embraced “agentic” capabilities that provide software assistants capable of independently tending to tasks, such as creating software applications, based on simple descriptions.
Futurum chief strategist Shay Boloor sees the moment as an “inflection point”, where millions of AI agents will soon be routinely handling tasks long tended to by people.
“We’ve never had a tech disruption at this scale before,” Mr Boloor told AFP.
“It’s extreme. The market is underwriting that future uncertainty in a doom-based scenario.”
The turning point has been marked by rapid-fire releases of ever-improving AI models, including recent new versions from OpenAI and Anthropic.
Add to that the November debut of autonomous AI agent OpenClaw that some have equated to the fictional “Jarvis” AI assistant from the Iron Man superhero films.
The creator of OpenClaw was snapped up by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, signalling that the San Francisco-based start-up has even more ambitious agentic aspirations.
Future or fiction?
Investors quickly saw AI agents as a threat to software publishers, particularly those serving businesses.
Monday.com, which specialises in workplace collaboration, along with Salesforce and Thomson Reuters with its tax, accounting and trade software arms, saw their stock value plummet 30 per cent or more on Wall Street in a matter of days.
Georgetown University management professor Jason Schloetzer recounted a recent chat with a chief executive who remarked about no longer needing consultants since there was “one in my pocket” thanks to AI.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said: “There’s paranoia around AI in every industry. I believe it’s way overdone.”
He viewed the concept of AI models replacing enterprise software and cybersecurity firms as “a fictional tale”.
Too much?
As AI agents begin shaking up work, creators of the large language models powering them continue to pour hundreds of billions of dollars
Claude-maker Anthropic has OpenAI, Google’s Gemini and even Grok from xAI nipping at its heels in the market for professional AI.
Even though massive spending on AI infrastructure has some investors worried, Mr Boloor contends that “the risk is not over-investing, but under-investing” in the transformative technology.
Prof Schloetzer reasons that the economic impact of AI may not be clear for several years, the same way it took time for the internet itself to become a vital part of daily life.
“Suddenly, entirely new businesses that had no economic attractiveness without the internet started to exist, like Netflix,” Prof Schloetzer said.
“I’m waiting to see these new companies or industries that are created (by AI).”
AI angst is spreading way beyond the tech industry.
A recent blog post by US entrepreneur Matt Shumer titled Something Big Is Happening includes a prediction that AI will be tackling jobs in law, finance, accounting, consulting, medicine and other fields.
The experience that tech workers had of seeing AI go from a “helpful tool” to something that “does my job better than I do” will ripple through the service sector, Mr Shumer predicted.
Some observers have criticised Mr Shumer’s post. In an opinion piece at the Mind Matters website, technology consultant Jeffrey Funk called it “hype” driven by fear.
“The markets are a rational mechanism,” analyst Mr Ives said of company shares being punished by AI worries.
“We’re going to get to a crossroads here pretty soon where things will settle down.” AFP

Opinion
I was charmed by a respected school principal. I’m devastated to discover his evil secret
I met Richard Barren a few times while he was the principal of Langwarrin Park Primary School, in Melbourne’s south-east. He was gregarious, enthusiastic, professional and proud of his school.
I particularly noticed the fondness with which he spoke about his students. I raked through my old meeting notes and found I’d written the words “potential” and “full of possibilities” as being how Barren described the children in his school.
I fell for it.
Last week, Barren was sentenced to effectively three paltry months of prison time for having some of the most disgusting child abuse material on his phone that anyone – let alone a school principal – might have.
And, despite more than three decades of working with teachers and teaching myself, collaborating with principals and also being one – my meetings with Barren didn’t raise a single red flag. I admit to being both confused and ashamed about that.
The meek and feeble nature of the Barren sentence has landed with incredulity on many of the school’s parents. They’re rightly confounded that a man afforded the trust of being a safe figure in the entire community’s eye could have betrayed them so deeply.
I remember, from my principal days, seeing the nervous faces of parents as they handed their children into my care – a bloke running a primary school. I felt the gravity of that responsibility and I accepted it.
The notion that a fellow member of the principal fraternity could have content on his phone revealing that he “love[s] perving on pool change rooms” sickens me.
Barren’s reply to a fellow Grindr user inquiring as to his age limits for potential prey was that there’s “no limit. the younger the better” left me stunned.
When I read further of the vile imagery and videos saved on a second phone of his, of grown men with girls around 12 years of age, I was enraged.
Principals are not just extractors of the best possible NAPLAN scores from our children. We are the custodians of a precious community trust. Barren’s indiscretions are far more than a crime. They’re a breach of a relational covenant.
While I’d loathe to be a judge considering the full plethora of factors in such cases, three months’ jail feels grotesquely meagre. I guess it’s another simple case of courts sentencing crimes, but communities carrying the consequences.
Beyond the parents of one school, the wider teaching community is also shamed by the full revelation of Barren’s offences. Each of the 141,000 registered and dedicated teachers across Victoria now stands in the shadow of his conduct.
Each now must strive that little bit harder for the parents of their students to trust them. Each knows what that lingering stare over a parental shoulder as they walk away from an early childhood classroom is really all about.
The outrage of our educators is also justifiable, as they must now accept that one predator has the power to unfairly stain their entire profession. Already living and working under intense scrutiny and strict ethical standards, their efforts to meet safeguarding requirements are already exhaustive.
This is why the Langwarrin Park PS story is awful, but equally important as it draws us to confront a hideously inconvenient truth. Deep down, we know there’s no way to psych test evil away. There’s no survey or observation that can weed out every paedophile.
Screening can always be made more robust – but it will remain as fallible as I was when I chatted cheerily with Barren over coffee. Even the tightest of systems will fail to eliminate human deception.
Allowing our outrage to lead us to the complete mistrust of every school employee welcomes a different and permanent harm upon our school communities.
Turning a blind eye is also no alternative.
And so, the community of Langwarrin Park PS is left with a dual burden. They have a rightful outrage to carry, at the same time as they hope to build a future for their children that requires deep trust in their school.
Fortunately, I’ve met most of the staff in that wonderful school and that trust – of my informed, experienced and imperfect observation – is well-placed.
Without trust, parents hover unhelpfully over qualified teachers and school leaders. Those teachers are then prone to retreating, removing the personal connection that underpins the best growth and learning.
Our schools become frightened, defensive institutions and children absorb the anxiety flowing through their corridors.
Trusting relationships are the foundations of learning and the fuel of growth. No school can thrive in a climate of entrenched suspicion.
When this happens, we need to grieve, denounce and ensure full accountability without abandoning our commitment to trust.
For if we stop trusting our schools, it’s our kids who will pay twice for the crimes of an infinitesimally small number of perpetrators.

Trump’s CIA pulls 19 intelligence reports, including analyses of white nationalism and LGBT+ issues
The reports ‘failed to be independent of political consideration,’ according to agency
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Central Intelligence Agency has withdrawn more than a dozen intelligence reports, including some that cover LGBT+ activism, white nationalism and contraception.
Director John Ratcliffe ordered the “official retraction or substantive revision” of 19 CIA intelligence reports that the agency claims “did not meet” intelligence community standards and “failed to be independent of political consideration,” the agency said Friday.
These documents were identified by the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which recently reviewed hundreds of analytic reports published over the last decade, the agency noted.
The CIA completely retracted 17 of those reports — which predate President Donald Trump’s second term — and pulled two for revisions, according to The Washington Post. The agency publicly shared redacted versions of three affected reports.
One of the reports — titled “Women Advancing White Racially and Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremist Radicalization and Recruitment” — was released in October 2021 under former President Joe Biden.
Racially motivated violent extremists were considered a significant security threat under Joe Biden’s administration and Trump’s first administration. Federal law enforcement under his second administration has focused on left-wing movements including antifa, which he labeled a domestic terrorist organization last year.
The White House also claimed in September that “radical left violence” has “permeated the nation in recent years.”
Another report — “Middle East-North Africa: LGBT Activists Under Pressure” — was issued under former President Barack Obama in January 2015.
A third report, “Worldwide: Pandemic-Related Contraceptive Shortfalls Threaten Economic Development,” was published in July 2020, during Trump’s first term.
The CIA said these documents “exhibit substantial deviations from the President’s expectations that CIA’s workforce remains independent from a particular audience, agenda, or policy viewpoint.”
A senior CIA official who spoke to journalists on the condition of anonymity said the reports dealt with inappropriate topics for the agency to cover, and in some instances relied on biased sources, according to The Washington Post.
The official added that training for analysts has been “retooled.”
“The intelligence products we released to the American people today — produced before my tenure as [CIA director] — fall short of the high standards of impartiality that CIA must uphold and do not reflect the expertise for which our analysts are renowned,” Ratcliffe said in a statement.
“There is absolutely no room for bias in our work and when we identify instances where analytic rigor has been compromised, we have a responsibility to correct the record,” he added.
Democratic Senator Mark Warner, vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized the move.
“The President’s Intelligence Advisory Board plays an important advisory role, but it is not a substitute for the independent analytic judgment of the CIA and the broader Intelligence Community,” he said.
“When a politically appointed body appears to be dictating what analysis is acceptable, it risks eroding confidence in the objectivity of our intelligence,” he added.
Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised Ratcliffe’s announcement and said he’s “been sending these kind of reports back to the CIA for years and observing that they contain no intelligence.”
“Our intelligence agencies have too often missed critical national-security developments to waste time on, for instance, how ‘pandemic-related contraceptive shortfalls threaten economic development.’ Honestly,” Cotton wrote on X.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran announced in a statement that it has designated the naval and air forces of all member states of the European Union as terrorist entities.
According to the statement, the measure constitutes reciprocal action in response to the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU governments to label the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization.
The decision follows a move adopted by EU member states on February 19, 2026. Iran’s Foreign Ministry stressed that the European action contravenes fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law, noting that the IRGC is an official branch of Iran’s armed forces.
The ministry cited Article 7 of Iran’s 2019 law titled “Countermeasures Against the Designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Terrorist Organization by the United States.” Under this legislation, any country that follows or supports the United States’ designation of the IRGC may be subject to reciprocal measures by Iran.
Based on this legal framework — including Article 4 of the same law — Iran has formally identified the naval and air forces of all EU member states as subject to countermeasures and designated them as terrorist organizations under its domestic legal system.
The statement concluded by emphasizing that the measure was taken within the framework of Iran’s national laws and in response to the clear violation of international legal principles by European governments.

Tar Halva: Traditional Iranian Ramadan dessert

As Ramadan arrives in southern Iran, the atmosphere shifts. In the historic city of Shiraz, the scent of fresh bread, dates, and homemade sweets fills homes before sunset. Among the many foods prepared for iftar, one traditional sweet continues to hold a special place on the table: Tar Halva.
Tar Halva has long been a staple of iftar tables in Shiraz. Made from wheat flour, natural syrups, and oil, the sweet is valued for its energy-boosting properties and what locals describe as its “warming” nature — qualities considered beneficial after a full day of fasting.
Despite the growing popularity of modern desserts and industrial sweets, Tar Halva has retained its place in Ramadan traditions.
More than just a sweet dish, Tar Halva forms part of the collective memory of Ramadan in Iran's Shiraz — recalling family gatherings before the sunset call to prayer, when households would break their fast with simple, homemade foods.
Mohammad Ramazani-Pour, a veteran Shirazi cook who prepares Tar Halva each Ramadan, says the essence of the sweet lies not only in its ingredients but in the process.
“Before it is a food, it is patience,” he explains.
The preparation begins with high-quality, sifted wheat flour. The flour is poured into a large pot or pan and toasted slowly over gentle heat. This stage is critical: the flour must not burn but gradually lose its raw aroma and turn a light golden-cream color.
Continuous stirring is essential. According to traditional wisdom, if the cook’s arm does not tire, the Tar Halva will not turn out properly.
Once the flour reaches the correct color, oil is added gradually while stirring continues to prevent clumping. Some use animal fat, others liquid oil, and some a combination of both.
The sweetness comes from strained grape syrup or date syrup, which is incorporated slowly. At this stage, the mixture darkens, and its aroma intensifies. Spices such as saffron and cardamom are added at the end to preserve their fragrance.
The sweet is ready when it thickens and begins to pull away from the sides of the pot — neither too soft nor too firm.
From a food science perspective, Tar Halva aligns with the nutritional needs of fasting.
Zahra Mohammadi-Nia, a senior food industry specialist, describes it as a simple yet purposeful snack suited to Ramadan. The toasted wheat flour not only improves flavor but also enhances digestibility. Gentle heat partially alters the starch structure, making it more accessible while removing the raw taste — a factor that significantly influences final quality.
Grape or date syrup serves as a natural source of simple, easily absorbed sugars. After hours of fasting, these sugars help restore lost energy quickly.
Unlike many sweets that contain refined sugars, artificial colors, and preservatives, homemade Tar Halva contains no additives. When prepared hygienically and with controlled amounts of oil and syrup, it can be considered a more natural alternative to processed desserts.
Moderate fat content also contributes to satiety and helps prevent rapid blood sugar drops.
The continued presence of Tar Halva on Ramadan tables reflects more than taste preference. It signals the preservation of culinary heritage at a time when processed foods dominate many markets.

Trump approves emergency declaration over massive Washington, DC, sewage spill

Trump approves emergency declaration over massive Washington, DC, sewage spill
Washington: US President Donald Trump has approved an emergency declaration for the District of Columbia, permitting federal agencies to provide disaster assistance to tackle a massive sewage spill in the Potomac River.
The spill began in mid-January, when part of a major DC Water sewage pipeline called the Potomac Interceptor collapsed, flooding the Potomac River with about 886 megalitres of wastewater. The sewer line carries about 227 megalitres of wastewater daily from the Virginia and Maryland suburbs to DC for treatment. The cause of the spill remains under investigation.
The US Environmental Protection Agency will lead the federal response to the spill, according to a news release from the agency. The EPA is co-ordinating with DC Water to ensure measures are taken “to protect public health and prevent additional overflows until the pipe is repaired and the Potomac Interceptor is fully functional again”. Repairs are due to be completed by mid-March, before events in the region celebrating the 250th anniversary of the US are set to begin.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency will also be “deploying a team to support incident management” and “working directly with local officials and federal partners to co-ordinate federal resources”, a social media post from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.
FEMA said the assistance would be directed to DC and the area where the district has responsibilities in Maryland and Virginia.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a public emergency on Wednesday (Washington time) and requested federal help with the clean-up. She also requested a presidential disaster declaration and asked the federal government to reimburse the DC government and DC Water for costs associated with the spill and recovery effort.
DC Water chief executive David Gadis estimated the repair and remediation would cost $US20 million ($28 million).
Trump, who previously criticised Bowser and other Democratic elected officials in the region over mishandling the spill, signalled on Thursday that the federal government would help with the recovery.
Bowser had faced questions over the timing of her emergency declaration, coming a month after the spill began. She said she took the actions, in part, after recent signals from the Trump administration that federal officials might support the request, and maintained that the response to the spill had been urgent from the start.
In his Truth Social post last week indicating that he would respond to Bowser’s request for aid, Trump continued to rail against Democratic governors Wes Moore (Maryland) and Abigail Spanberger (Virginia).
“Governors of Virginia and Maryland must get moving, quickly,” he wrote. “If they can’t do the job, all they have to do is call, be polite and respectful, and the federal government will handle it, and bill them for services rendered, at a later date.”
Authorities have advised against boating, fishing and touching the Potomac River since the spill, but DC officials said last week that they hoped to lift the guidance on March 2, subject to change based on water quality, as testing has shown the level of E. coli in the DC portion of the river consistently hovering under safe recreational limits.
There has not been sewage overflow into the river since February 8.
Officials with DC Water, the public utility responsible for water and sewage in the region, have said drinking water remains safe. But officials have issued warnings for people and pets to stay out of the water near the spill site and downstream in the district.

IDF celebrates new search and rescue unit amid growing tensions with Iran

13:12:21 KST

Amid the rising tensions between the United States and Iran this week, the Home Front Command is set to receive major reinforcements, in the form of a brand new search and rescue unit. The first company of the Fifth Battalion of Home Front Command's Rescue Brigade completed its eight-month training course last week, while the second company began its advanced training last week and will soon follow suit in becoming fully operational.
Nicknamed "The Lion Battalion," the unit was originally formed in response to the October 7th attack. During routine operations, the battalion’s fighters serve as a light infantry unit, handling security tasks in one of the sectors. However, in an emergency, they transition to their role as the Home Front Command’s search-and-rescue unit, operating within IDF training zones or in civilian areas.
Although the battalion was not yet fully operational during the 12-Day War with Iran, its commanders were already deployed in disaster zones in Rishon Lezion, Bnei Brak, Bat Yam, and Ramat Gan, rescuing trapped civilians. In this way, the battalion began to accumulate a combat record, even before its official formation.
Capt. A, commander of the first company, has overseen the integration of the first recruits into the new battalion over the past eight months.
He explained that, if Israel faces missile attacks from Iran or other regions like Lebanon, Yemen, or Syria, and large-scale destruction requires rescue operations, a battalion like his could be called into action. "We are prepared starting this week for any rescue event," said Capt. A.
At just 23 years old, Capt. A grew up in Nahariya and enlisted in the IDF in August 2020 with the "Shahar" 498 battalion - the IDF's search-and-rescue battalion comprised of soldiers in their mandatory service. Throughout his service, he progressed through various command roles, including squad commander, platoon commander, and deputy company commander.
As part of preparations for leading the first company of the "Lion" battalion, Capt. A conducted search-and-rescue operations during the 12-Day War.
Ready to jump into action at any moment
Capt. A told Ma'ariv about the Home Front Command's Rescue Brigade's unique nature.
"We are capable of conducting rescue operations under rubble and saving the lives of civilians," he said, adding, "We are going to be holding a position in the West Bank. But the moment we are needed [elsewhere], we will leave the West Bank to carry out the mission." He continues, "Right after the war [with Iran] began, we were deployed as a rescue force. We left our houses and began the rescues."
Capt. A excitedly described the festive atmosphere and the historic significance within the unit: "The motivation here is sky-high. Yesterday, after more than seven months of intense, grueling training, the company received the orange beret during an emotional march – just before transitioning to operational status. Next week, we will go for training ahead of our operational deployment, and on Sunday, the new platoon commander will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
"In addition to the final march of the training course, a company march will be held at Mt. Eitan to mark the battalion's inauguration and the unveiling of the company's official name, which will start with the letter 'A.'"

Israel Police arrested five suspects in an illegal crypto operation on Monday, along with the confiscation of weapons, drugs, and cash.
According to a police spokesperson, the National Cyber Crime Unit of Lahav 433 has been conducting a covert investigation over the last few months into an illegal cryptocurrency financial service, as well as suspected possession of illegal weaponry.
On Monday, police raided the homes and office of the suspects in Rishon Lezion. There, they arrested the five suspects, aged 30-50, and took them in for interrogation.
During the raid, police located around 80,000 shekels in cash, as well as guns, stun grenades, plastic explosives, ammunition, and a substance suspected to be cocaine.
The explosive materials were safely brought to a lab for further investigation.
Illegal business suspected of loaning cash to criminals
Police also announced on Monday that Lahav 433 had arrested seven people in Kafr Kassem for running an illegal change operation.
Police stated that the suspects were thought to have conducted financial services without a license, including an illegal money loaning business, which may have extended tens of millions of shekels in loans to criminals.
During raids on the change operation, police confiscated blank checks, seals, invoices, real estate documentation, high-end cars, a substance suspected to be cocaine, and around NIS 430,000 in cash.

Trump’s Carlson outreach was worth trying, but it ultimately failed - editorial

The Trump administration’s involvement in arranging an on-camera conversation between Tucker Carlson and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was not a throwaway media gesture.
It was a recognition that a specific problem on the American Right has grown too large to ignore: the steady normalization of Israel-baiting conspiracies and antisemitic insinuations, pushed not only from the margins but by influential voices with massive audiences.
For an administration that owes much of its political energy to the Right’s media ecosystem, nudging one of that ecosystem’s biggest stars into a public exchange with its ambassador was a sign that the issue is very real and being taken seriously.
The Jerusalem Post has pointed out the Israel and antisemitism divide on the American Right time and time again. This paper has also criticized prominent Republicans, including JD Vance, for avoiding direct confrontation with right-wing antisemitic rhetoric, even as they posture as champions of moral clarity.
That avoidance has consequences: it tells activists, streamers, and opportunists that they can lace their arguments about Israel with familiar tropes and still be welcomed as part of a respectable coalition.
That is what made the Carlson-Huckabee meeting worth attempting. The hope was obvious: expose Carlson, in Israel, across from a Trump-appointed ambassador, to facts and context that could puncture the worst caricatures.
Carlson flew in for only a short visit, conducted the interview at Ben-Gurion Airport, and did not travel farther into the country. The idea seemed to be to create a clear, controlled moment of engagement, without theatrics and without the friction of a full trip.
Instead, the interview and what followed showed that good intentions alone won’t solve this problem.
Prosecutor with a pre-written indictment
Carlson arrived not as a curious interviewer but as a prosecutor with a pre-written indictment.
One of the starkest moments came when he insinuated that President Isaac Herzog “apparently was at Pedo Island,” a smear-by-association tied to Jeffrey Epstein. It was not presented with evidence, context, or restraint, just a baseless claim formulated from an AI photo that has been heavily debunked. Huckabee did not validate it, but the damage was in the act itself: a mainstream right-wing celebrity floating a defamatory insinuation about Israel’s president as though it were a responsible inquiry.
Carlson also pushed a claim about Christians in Israel that collapses under the most basic demographic reality. He asserted that Christians are “far fewer in absolute numbers” than at Israel’s founding, using the line to frame Israel as a place that shrinks and endangers Christian life.
The record shows something different: the Christian population has grown in absolute terms over the decades, while its percentage share shifted as other communities grew faster. The point is not to litigate a spreadsheet. It is to show a pattern: take a complicated reality, sand off the nuance, and present it as evidence of moral rot.
Then came the broader framing that has made Carlson a central node in the Right’s anti-Israel turn: the suggestion that American support is not a strategic partnership but a kind of civilizational subsidy, underwriting Israel’s “cultural and religious life” and, by implication, its internal social choices.
This is a familiar maneuver. It encourages viewers to see Israel not as an ally facing Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas, but as an alien project extracting resources and imposing values. It is the gateway drug to the older insinuations that always follow: who benefits, who controls, who pulls the strings.
If the interview revealed the posture, the airport episode revealed the strategy. Just a few hours after the conversation was filmed, Carlson claimed he was “detained” at the airport for undergoing a routine security check that all passengers go through.
Footage spread on social media later showed what really happened: routine questioning in a private setting, Carlson smiling, signing paperwork, and posing for photos.
That sequence shows the bridge was never meant to hold. Even when offered a controlled, face-to-face conversation with the administration’s ambassador, Carlson always intended to provoke even further. That is not a failed conversation. It shows that the conversation was never the point.
The administration deserves credit for recognizing the seriousness of antisemitism on the Right and the Israel divide feeding it. But the Carlson–Huckabee experiment also taught a lesson: outreach to a bad-faith megaphone does not tame the megaphone. It sharpens it.
The intention was good. The experiment failed. The next step must be something firmer than another invitation.

Pakistan strikes Afghanistan targets after blaming attacks on Afghan terrorists

Pakistan said it carried out cross-border strikes on targets inside Afghanistan after blaming a series of recent suicide bombings - including attacks during the holy month of Ramadan - on fighters it said were operating from Afghan territory.
The strikes mark a sharp escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, days after Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move aimed at easing tensions following months of border clashes along the rugged frontier.
In a statement dated February 21 that was released early on Sunday, the ministry said it had "conclusive evidence" the attacks were carried out by what it calls Khwarij, its term for the Pakistani Taliban, acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
It said Pakistan carried out "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State Khorasan Province along the border with Afghanistan.
Reuters could not immediately reach Afghanistan's Taliban authorities for comment. Kabul has repeatedly denied allowing terrorists to use Afghan territory to stage attacks inside Pakistan.
Pakistan sees spate of terror attacks
The government said recent attacks included a bombing at a Shi'ite mosque in Islamabad and violence in the northwestern border districts of Bajaur and Bannu, where the military on Saturday said a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of security forces, killing five terrorists in a gun battle and two soldiers when an explosives-laden vehicle rammed into a military vehicle.
Tensions have repeatedly forced key border crossings to shut, disrupting trade and movement along the 2,600-km (1,600-mile) frontier.
Dozens were killed in clashes in October before the two sides agreed to a fragile ceasefire, but Pakistan continues to accuse Afghanistan's Taliban rulers of harboring terrorists who stage attacks inside its territory - a claim Kabul denies.

Where is Kim Ju Ae? Kim Jong-un’s daughter absent from key party congress amid succession rumours
Kim Ju Ae’s presence at the conference was hotly anticipated after South Korean intelligence briefings suggested she had entered ‘successor-designate stage’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s daughter was absent as the country opened its key party congress in Pyongyang this week, prolonging ambiguity over the state’s succession plans.
The ninth congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, convened only once every five years, is North Korea’s most important political gathering and is expected to steer policy on the economy, defence, and foreign relations through the end of the decade.
Kim Ju Ae, believed to be about 13 years old, has been seen regularly by her father’s side at major military parades, weapons tests, party celebrations, and high-profile construction projects since she first entered public view in November 2022.
Her lack of appearance at the congress is significant because South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers earlier this month that Kim Ju Ae had entered what it described as a “successor-designate stage”.
Ms Kim has increasingly been viewed as Mr Kim’s most likely successor, particularly after a high-profile trip to China in 2025.
The South Korean spy agency briefing raised expectations that the congress might offer the clearest signal yet on Mr Kim’s succession.
The South Korean National Intelligence Service was initially sceptical that Kim Ju Ae could be chosen as a North Korean leader, owing to the country’s deeply conservative culture and male-dominated leadership dating back to its founding under Kim Il Sung, the current leader’s grandfather.
But the sheer volume of high-profile appearances she has made since then alongside the North Korean leader has shifted that assessment, and Seoul now sees them as part of an effort to build a “narrative” paving the way for the country to accept its first female leader.
North Korean state media outlets have never published her name, referring to her as Mr Kim’s “respected” or “most beloved” child. The belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA champion Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding the North Korean leader’s baby daughter during a trip to Pyongyang in 2013.
The party conference opened on Thursday, with the leader delivering a speech in Pyongyang declaring that the last five years had been a “proud period” for North Korea, since the country had achieved its goals “in all realms such as politics, the economy, national defence, culture, and diplomacy”.
“In view of the external relations, too, the position of our state was firmly consolidated as an irreversible one, bringing about a great change in the global political landscape and in the influence on our state,” he said, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
Those comments appear to reference Pyongyang’s growing ties with China, where Mr Kim attended his first-ever multilateral diplomatic talks alongside a military parade in Beijing last year, and Russia, where North Korea became the first third-party ally in the world to commit thousands of frontline troops to take part in the Russia-Ukraine war.
At least 5,000 members of the ruling party are attending the meeting, and congratulatory letters were sent from Russia, China, Vietnam, and Laos.
Mr Kim’s regime presides over one of the most impoverished nations in the world, with more than 45 per cent of the population undernourished according to a 2023 UN report. Later data is not available due to a lack of access to a kingdom that is almost completely shut off from the outside world.
Mr Kim blames external factors for the challenges the country faces, citing “hostile forces [that] grew more reckless in their schemes for harsh blockades and sanctions against us”.
Natural disasters and the Covid-19 pandemic also “severely hindered the development of all our sectors, and it also seriously threatened the security of our state and the safety of our people,” he said.
On Saturday, Mr Kim delivered a report to the congress on the work done by the party. The central committee, he said, “fulfilled its important mission and role as the vanguard of the revolution, ushering in a new era of unprecedented changes and upsurge in the scope and depth of struggle and speed of development”.
The report, according to KCNA, laid out longer-term objectives and the methods for achieving them, though specific targets were not disclosed.
The congress endorsed Mr Kim’s report, and reportedly described it as a “revolutionary guideline” that will lead to “more rapid development, faster change, and greater progress”.
It is still possible that Kim Ju Ae could make an appearance in the latter stages of the conference, despite her father having delivered two major addresses already without her. It is not known exactly when the event will conclude, with the previous two party congresses lasting four and eight days respectively.

A long-acting HIV drug arrives in Zimbabwe for some at highest risk
Zimbabwe is one of the world's first countries to roll out lenacapavir, a long-acting HIV prevention drug that is administered only twice a year
- Bookmark
Young women, mothers holding babies and some men lined up in a dusty field on the outskirts of Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. They came for injections of a new HIV prevention drug launched in the country on Thursday, one that only needs to be administered twice a year.
Zimbabwe, where HIV has led to tens of thousands of deaths over the past two decades, is one of the first countries to roll out lenacapavir, a long-acting drug that authorities hope will slow new infections.
With clinical studies demonstrating near-total protection, the drug has been described by some health officials as a turning point for high-risk groups. Others warn that turning scientific promise into broad impact will require overcoming funding constraints, infrastructure gaps and the challenge of keeping patients engaged.
At the Zimbabwe launch, Constance Mukoloka stepped out of a mobile clinic, beaming with relief after receiving one of the first doses.
“I am safe, I can work with confidence now,” said the 27-year-old sex worker, describing how daily preventive preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, pills often created tension with clients and proved difficult to take consistently — putting her and others at risk.
Could reshape HIV prevention strategies
Mukoloka is among the first beneficiaries of a donor-supported rollout of lenacapavir across 10 African countries. Health officials and advocates say the drug could reshape HIV prevention strategies if governments can navigate barriers of cost and fragile health systems.
Developed by California-based Gilead Sciences, lenacapavir’s introduction in selected high-risk countries is being supported through the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, in partnership with the Global Fund.
The injection is offered for free in Zimbabwe to high-risk people such as sex workers, adolescent girls and young women, gay men and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
For Mukoloka, the drug represents more than convenience.
“When I took tablets, customers would see a container of pills and leave. They would never return due to fear,” she said. “They couldn’t tell the difference between PrEP and treatment drugs. With the work we do, that stigma costs you money.”
Daily oral PrEP has long been available in Zimbabwe alongside condoms, vaginal rings and shorter-acting injectables. Yet adherence has remained a challenge, particularly for people facing stigma or unpredictable schedules.
“I work in beer halls looking for clients. Sometimes I would get drunk and forget to take my drugs,” Mukoloka said. “Sometimes I would work all night and not have time. Some clients refuse protection. They say ... 'Why should I use protection when I have paid?’”
Extended duration an advantage
Health authorities see lenacapavir’s discreetness and extended duration as a critical advantage for key populations such as sex workers and therefore a boost in fighting the spread of HIV.
“Prevention must fit into real life. If a health solution is too complicated, too demanding, or too visible, people simply won’t use it,” Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe’s health minister, said at Thursday's launch. “Lenacapavir represents a new way of doing things.”
The drug has been rolled out in other southern African nations like Zambia and Eswatini.
Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Zambia, once global HIV epicenters, have emerged in recent years as among the world’s most successful models in controlling the epidemic, achieving World Health Organization testing, treatment and viral suppression targets.
Yet despite these gains, new infections remain a concern, particularly among adolescent girls and young women.
According to the United Nations children’s agency, HIV prevalence among adolescent girls and young women aged 10-24 is “persistently” triple that of their male counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa, driven by gender inequality, poverty and uneven access to health services.
In sub-Saharan Africa, women and girls of all ages accounted for 63% of all new HIV infections in 2024, according to UNAIDS. In all other geographical regions, about 73% of new infections in 2024 occurred among men and boys.
In Zimbabwe, authorities say about 46,000 people across 24 sites are expected to benefit in the early phase of the lenacapavir rollout, a fraction of potential demand in a country of roughly 15 million.
High cost of mass rollouts
Details for the next phase are not clear. The government says it hopes the number of beneficiaries will increase as more donor-funded doses arrive. It also hopes to acquire its own doses for a mass rollout but, like many other African governments, lacks enough money.
Health officials, experts and activists warn that practical realities could tamper the drug's early promise in Africa, a continent of over 1.5 billion people, not least due to the high cost of mass rollouts for governments.
In Kenya, which received its first 21,000 lenacapavir doses this week, the government said the injectable would be offered at a negotiated price of about $54 per person per year, still a heavy cost for many.
Gilead Sciences has said it would sell its drug at no profit to low and middle-income countries heavily affected by HIV.
Bellinda Thibela, who works on health justice and access at Health GAP, an international advocacy organization, described the move as “a bit comforting” but hardly enough on its own on a continent where health systems have heavily relied on external funding that is diminishing, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign aid cuts.
Challenges will remain in countries that were "80% to 90% dependent on U.S. funding,” Thibela said. “What’s the point of having a reduced price if there is no staff and equipment in clinics?”
While many clinicians describe lenacapavir as a significant advance, they stress it must complement, not replace, prevention tools.
“Condoms remain key. They are cheap and they also prevent other sexually transmitted infections,” said Enerst Chikwati, Zimbabwe program director at AIDS Healthcare Foundation.
But for early recipients such as Mukoloka, the drug’s impact already feels profound.
“I am elated. I can go for a whole six months feeling safe,” she said.

Trump sends ‘great’ hospital boat to treat ‘sick’ people in Greenland
The move comes amid simmering US-Denmark tensions over the mineral-rich Arctic territory
US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was sending a hospital boat to Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory that he has long coveted and threatened to seize by force.
Trump’s rhetoric has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Denmark, while putting the global spotlight on the Arctic as he insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
He said the boat would treat many “sick” people in Greenland, without providing any details on who he was referring to or the number of people the vessel would help.
“We are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there,” Trump said in a social media post.
“It’s on the way!!!,” he added.
The post on his social media platform carried an apparent AI image that depicted the USNS Mercy – a 272-metre (894-foot) vessel that is typically stationed in southern California – sailing towards snowcapped mountains on the horizon.

HK$261 million of frozen crime funds may take 7 years to reach Hong Kong coffers
Trials and other legal procedures must first be completed before funds can be deposited into treasury, insider says
Hong Kong authorities froze HK$261 million (US$33.4 million) in suspected criminal proceeds linked to money laundering and drug trafficking last year, but experts say it may take as long as seven years for any of the funds to reach government coffers.
According to data from the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, run by police and customs, HK$869 million in criminal proceeds was confiscated between 2018 and 2024, with the annual amount fluctuating from HK$284 million in 2018 to HK$18 million in 2024.
Last year, 927 people were convicted of money laundering, with the joint unit freezing HK$261 million.
“After we freeze suspected criminal assets upon arrest, we still have to investigate the case and bring it to court,” a source told the South China Morning Post.
The insider added that suspected criminal proceeds could be confiscated and deposited into the treasury after trials were wrapped up, but other legal procedures would have to be completed before any money could be channelled into government coffers.
The sum frozen last year did not include HK$2.75 billion in cash, stocks and funds allegedly linked to the network of Fujian-born Cambodian businessman Chen Zhi and his Prince Holding Group.

"Oh! The beautiful, the fond memories of my childhood. My earliest memories took place in the port of Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. When I was just a little boy – 6 years old – I could recognize the ship that would appear far away on the horizon, heading for our port (...). The cab drivers with their horse-drawn carriages on the quays often asked me:
'Hey! Yossia! Is that the Maria, or is it the Ivan Demiakin coming in?'
'It's the Maria!'
I was never wrong (...). I knew all the particularities of 'my' ships, having seen them dock before my eyes so many times. We lived at the port (my father was a schoolteacher, and the Tsar's good rubles never filled our pockets). I loved those roughly cobbled quays, where I spent long and beautiful days playing, facing that southern Russian sea."
These lines, written in 1970, open a tawny faux-leather notebook that's now tucked away in the gentle clutter of a drawer near Porte Dauphine, in Paris's 16th arrondissement. Its cover bears the title Voici déjà l'hiver ("Already, Winter Is Here") − the winter of a life. The author, Joseph Ginsburg (little Yossia), died a year later. He was the father of Serge Gainsbourg and of his elder sister, Jacqueline, who is approaching her 100th birthday. She welcomed us into her home and let us read roughly 40 or so pages, filled with black and blue ink.
Through faded photographs, 25 years of the life of the man who passed on his passion for music to Serge Gainsbourg unfold – a quarter-century of travels through cities once unknown to the French, but which now resonate differently in their ears: Kharkov (Kharkiv), Mariupol, Lougansk (Luhansk), Ekaterinoslav (Dnipro)...

Chen Mo – the man behind Heroes of Jin Yong – on AI and making a blockbuster game
Creator of new incarnation of martial arts epic says connection to the game is more than commercial – it is personal
On the large screen, characters called Eastern Heretic, Western Venom, Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar appeared in exquisitely rendered martial arts duels. Rising above it all with a sinister smile was Dongfang Bubai, a martial artist who castrated himself to learn the secrets of the skills in the legendary Sunflower Manual.
The game brings characters from all 14 of the author’s wuxia novels, works that have been enjoyed by generations of people within China and in Chinese communities around the world.
The game is still in development and, with its billion-yuan price tag, already on track to be the most expensive ever made in China.
But just days after the trailer’s release in late January, its producer came under fire from fans, who queried elements of the storyline and whether the makers were using artificial intelligence (AI) – an accusation akin to plagiarism in the gaming world.
In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Chen Mo, the 42-year-old founder of CreateAI, the company behind the new incarnation of the game, defended the new venture and said that while AI was in the firm’s name, it was not in the animation process.

WASHINGTON, February 22. /TASS/. The United States has dispatched a hospital vessel to the shores of Greenland to provide medical assistance to all local residents, "who are sick," US President Donald Trump stated.
"Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way!!!" the US president stated on his Truth Social network account.
On December 21, 2025, Trump appointed Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry as the US special envoy for Greenland. Following his appointment, Landry said on the X media platform that he would seek to bring the island under US control. The statement triggered a diplomatic scandal in Copenhagen that prompted the Danish Foreign Ministry to summon US Ambassador Kenneth Howery.
On March 13, 2025, Trump stated that the United States would annex Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark. On March 4, he said he would approve a decision by the island’s people to join the United States.
The US leader has repeatedly said that Greenland should become part of the United States. He threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it did not give up the island. Even during his first term, Trump offered to buy Greenland. Denmark and Greenland rejected the idea.

Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Rondale Moore died Saturday in southern Indiana, according to officials. He was 25 years old.
New Albany police chief Todd Bailey said Moore was found in a garage with a suspected self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to local network WLKY. The Floyd County Coroner’s Office confirmed his death Saturday evening.
An autopsy will be performed, and his death remains under investigation, the network reports.
Moore, a star receiver at Purdue University, was drafted into the NFL by the Arizona Cardinals in 2021. He played with the team for three years before a series of knee injuries stalled his career for several seasons.
He signed with the Vikings before the 2025 season and tore his ACL in the first preseason game.
Tributes have poured in from across the NFL and from his alma mater.
University of Louisville head coach Jeff Brohm, who coached Moore at Purdue, said Moore was “a complete joy to coach.”
“The ultimate competitor that wouldn’t back down from any challenge,” he wrote. “Rondale had a work ethic unmatched by anyone. A great teammate that would come through in any situation.”
“We all loved Rondale, we loved his smile and competitive edge that always wanted to please everyone he came in contact with. We offer all of our thoughts and prayers to Rondale and his family, we love him very much,” he added.
“Bro ain’t no way brotha you just messaged me few hours ago,” wrote Kansas City Chiefs receiver Hollywood Brown, who played for the Arizona Cardinals with Moore.
New York Giants quarterback Russell Wilson said he’s “heartbroken” for Moore’s “family, friends, & teammates.”
Sauce Gardner, a cornerback for the Indianapolis Colts, re-shared a post about Moore’s death. He added: “Bro..... what is going on in the world right now?”
Purdue Football said the community is “deeply saddened by the news of Rondale Moore’s tragic passing.”
“An All-American with an infectious smile, Rondale was a joy on and off the field. Someone who left this world too soon, Rondale will be remembered as a legendary Boilermaker. Our thoughts and prayers are with Rondale’s family and loved ones during this difficult time,” the organization said in a statement.
The NFL Player’s Association said the union is “devastated” by the news.
“This immense loss is felt deeply across our union, and we value his service as a player rep. Our condolences and prayers are with Rondale’s family, teammates, and loved one during this incredibly difficult time,” the organization said. “In moments like this we are reminded of how much our players carry, on and off the field. To our members: Please know that support is always within reach.”

North Korea’s Hollywood-style thriller unveils taboo plot against Kim’s father
‘Days and Nights of Confrontation’, which depicts a plot to kill Kim Jong-il, was released for the first time on state television last month
The film Days and Nights of Confrontation, which had been screened at cinemas in Pyongyang since last year, was released for the first time on state-run Korean Central Television in January.
The perpetrator of the plot to murder Kim Jong-il is a son of the man who attempted to kill Kim Il-sung. Both of the offenders are depicted as counter-revolutionary elements.
According to South Korean media, the new suspenseful thriller, which reportedly won three awards at the Pyongyang International Film Festival, features Hollywood-style action sequences, including train fights, car chases and explosions.
In 2024, the film 72 hours about lessons learned from the Korean war was released in North Korea. Kim Jong-un was closely involved in the production of the film featuring violent action scenes and computer graphics. He reportedly wrote the script and directed the acting.

Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,459
These are the key developments from day 1,459 of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Published On 22 Feb 2026
Here is where things stand on Sunday, February 22:
Fighting

- “Moscow cannot speak of economic dialogue with the United States while attacking US-owned production facilities,” Sybiha added.
- In the front-line Kherson region, Russian shelling wounded two police officers and one civilian, Ukraine’s National Police wrote on Telegram. Three apartment buildings, 18 homes, a hospital and numerous public buildings sustained damage.

Islamic State slams Syria's president as 'puppet without a soul,' urges new attacks

The Islamic State group has blasted Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, calling him a "puppet without a soul" controlled by Western countries, adding that his fate eventually will be similar to that of ousted leader Bashar Assad.
In an audio message released late Saturday by the group's spokesman, who identifies himself as Abu Huzaifa al-Ansari, he called on IS followers around the world to attack Jewish and Western targets as they have in past years.
Al-Ansari sent greetings to IS fighters from the group's leader Abu Hafs al-Hashemi al-Qurayshi, who was named as the head of the group in August 2023.
The audio is the first to be released by the group in months and comes after IS was blamed for attacks that left dozens dead or wounded in recent months in Syria, Iraq, Pakistan and other parts of the world.
In December, the group was blamed for an attack in central Syria that left three Americans dead and triggered intense U.S. airstrikes on the extremists' suspected hideouts in the country.
Despite its defeat in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, IS sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in both countries, where they once declared a caliphate.
The UN chief said earlier this month in a report on threats posed by IS that Syria's president, interior minister and foreign minister were the targets of five foiled assassination attempts last year.
In December 2024, insurgents led by now-interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, marched to Damascus and removed then-President Bashar Assad from power, striking a severe blow to Iran's influence in the war-torn country. Assad belonged to the minority Alawite sect in the predominantly Sunni Muslim country.
Since then, al-Sharaa, a former leader of al-Qaida's branch in Syria, has improved his relations with Western countries and last year became the first Syrian head of state to visit Washington since Syria's independence in 1946.
Al-Ansari said that Iran and Assad in Syria were replaced "with a regime that is subjected to American influence."
"Syria today is ruled by the Crusaders after they placed a leader who is a puppet without a soul," al-Ansari said. He vowed new attacks in the country, saying that "Syria has entered a new era of defense and the convoys of jihad will eventually march in Syria."
The audio, which is supposed to mark the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, did not mention the transfer of 5,704 suspected IS detainees from prisons in northeast Syria to Iraq in recent weeks. Al-Ansari only said that everyone is scared of the detainees, whom the Americans, Shiites and Kurdish fighters are doing all they can to make sure they don't escape.
Al-Ansari also did not mention the al-Hol camp that used to house more than 24,000 people, mostly women and children linked to IS, that is now almost empty after government forces took control of it last month from the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
He acknowledged that IS lost fighters over the past two years because of attacks by the U.S.-led coalition against IS. The Syrian government officially joined the coalition in November.

Will the United States strike Iran? Who will win the Super Bowl? The Oscars? The municipal elections in Paris? These uncertainties can pay off big on Polymarket. With a rather austere appearance, the American website presents thousands of questions, allowing bettors to wager on the outcome of current events and collect winnings if they choose correctly.
In the United States, such prediction market platforms are booming. In November 2025, the volume of bets on Polymarket and Kalshi, the two leaders in the sector, was estimated at nearly $13 billion (€10.9 billion). By early 2026, Polymarket has claimed tens of millions of visitors and hundreds of thousands of active traders.
Molly White, a researcher and engineer from Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, described "a powerful trend" in the United States, "where everything becomes an excuse for gambling." Nikos Smyrnaios, a professor of social sciences at the University of Toulouse, added that there are issues raised by "risk speculation," which he described as characterized by "a total absence of ethics."

Naive pacifism today promoting wars of tomorrow – Merz
He made the statement at a congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Stuttgart, Ukrinform reports, citing Tagesspiegel.
“We stand by the Ukrainian people without any ifs, ands, or buts. We will never accept how a criminal Russian regime systematically wages war against the civilian population of this country, against the elderly, against women, and against children.,” the Chancellor said.
Merz also strongly condemned Russian propaganda, which he said combines Russia’s aggression against Ukraine with “an almost unbearable Nazi propaganda against the Ukrainian people – a people who have suffered under German and Russian tyranny like almost no other in the world.”
According to him, Russia’s war against Ukraine is “a test of our values and our resolve.” Merz urged people to remember the lessons of history: “Appeasement does not create peace. It only emboldens the aggressor.
The chancellor warned that “a naive pacifism today is promoting the wars of tomorrow.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Germany will provide Ukraine with more than €11.5 billion in direct military assistance this year.

We’re going to need a bigger park: Perth welcomes drum and bass icon
Perth is the home of drum and bass in the southern hemisphere so it’s no surprise when one of the genre’s icons - Sub Focus aka Nicolaas Douwma - brought his Circular Sounds tour here tickets were snapped up so feverishly organisers scrambled to find a new venue than the original Ozone Reserve.
We’re going to need a bigger park.
Thousands of dance music fans streamed into the bigger venue at Wellington Square on a cool Saturday evening and were treated to a smorgasbord of high BPM and deep wubs.
It’s the first time the English DJ and producer has played Perth since Wildlands Festival in 2023.
With the event bearing his name so this time, he came with plenty of audiovisual goodies to accompany his fast-paced set, including a large light ring that lowered above him at several points.
He opened his set with his breakout 2009 hit from his eponymous album Rock It and from there launched into hit after hit across his impressive 17-year discography.
Highlights were the air-punching Illuminate from his 2020 album Portals produced with his fellow UK drum and bass pal Wilkinson, which was mixed into a rework of 2000s dance anthem Toca’s Miracle by Fragma.
Sub Focus’ sound is driven heavily by big atmospheric female vocals.
Tracks like 2018’s Desire and Wildfire from his latest album Contact whipped the Wellington Square crowd into a heaving mess.
A personal favourite was the boppy earworm On & On with British singer bbyclose.
Earlier in the evening, dubstep royalty Nero started with a bang - dropping their heavy anthem Innocence from their iconic 2011 album Welcome Reality. What followed was a fairly subdued set with some standout bangers like Promises, Me and You and their remix of UK rapper Plan B’s The Recluse.
Wellington Square was a great venue and a smart choice to give a drum and bass evening like that the grandeur it deserved, but lost points for a lack of toilets resulting in some very desperate people spending more time looking at a closed portaloo door than their favourite artist.

It is one of the most popular tourism spots in Victoria, but locals face a deadly risk
When the dense fog rolls over the Wild Dog Valley obscuring the panoramic view of the Apollo Bay coastline below, Lindsay Grayson knows the mobile phone reception will be terrible. Even reliable spots within metres of his home might go blank or barely register.
In these conditions, Grayson depended on the landline that was his key connection to the outside world. That simple piece of technology, connected to the phone network by underground copper wire, could mean the difference between life and death.
When Grayson, an infectious disease expert, and his wife bought the farming property in the Apollo Bay hinterland about 25 years ago, there was no phone line connected. They decided to install a landline for safety in their shearing shed – in case of snake bites, fires or farming accidents.
“I know a copper landline may be an old-fashioned idea, but it was developed because it’s safe, and it works,” Grayson said.
Until recently, Grayson also had a landline to the house he bought in 2019 – a steep and windy two-kilometre drive from his shearing shed. But this year Grayson was told that NBN Co, which maintains the landline to his home, wanted to cease operating that phone service due to the cost of maintaining it.
“I’m not asking for a new copper line,” he said. “This copper line’s been here all along. All we’re asking for is maintenance in a high-risk bushfire zone. Here in bushfire zones, the copper line is absolutely vital because it works even when the power supply is cut off.”
Grayson said the landline to his house had been disconnected for the past three months and there were sections of wire lying on the ground and clearly damaged.
Throughout the region, the companies that operate and maintain the telecommunications infrastructure want to phase out copper landlines.
But local advocates for retaining them are urging the corporations to keep the copper wires amid fears replacement services are vulnerable to power failures and interference from smoke and fog.
As climate change increases the likelihood of more catastrophic events, communities are facing new challenges in how they communicate and receive information during disasters.
Early this year, Grayson’s family received a phone call from a Telstra representative notifying them that NBN Co did not want to repair the existing copper service to his home and seven other nearby properties as this would require 500 metres of new cable at a cost of $36,000 to the company.
While Grayson’s landline to his home is maintained by NBN Co, the landline to his farm shed nearby is maintained by Telstra. Despite the complexity of this arrangement, Grayson deals with Telstra to report faults and damage to both landlines.
He said losing the landline to his home could leave him dangerously isolated in an emergency because landline alternatives proposed by Telstra, including satellite-based services, were expensive and reliant on power, which often failed during fires and storms.
“I just need to be able to call the ambulance or CFA,” he said.
NBN Co is responsible for maintaining and restoring its network infrastructure, but the company insists its responsibility for copper assets does not extend to preserving or replacing ageing infrastructure indefinitely.
A spokeswoman for NBN Co said some properties in Apollo Bay continued to rely on “legacy” copper lines originally built and operated by Telstra.
She said NBN maintained some sections of this infrastructure to support the continuity of existing landlines provided by Telstra under arrangements established during the rollout of the NBN.
“NBN recognises the importance of reliable communications, particularly in regional and high-risk areas,” she said.
The spokeswoman said NBN Co was working with Telstra and its customers to explore alternative options where infrastructure, like degrading copper lines, could no longer be feasibly maintained.
Apollo Bay resident Jane Gross said she was aware of 31 households out of 55 in two main Apollo Bay valleys who still relied on their landlines, particularly when disasters threatened.
Although her landline is managed by Telstra, she said the company also wanted to phase out the service.
She said having a landline was critical when the electricity failed because the copper wires were powered independently.
“It’s reliable when everything else goes out,” Gross said.
She has poor mobile reception at her home and uses an internet connection to make calls over Wi-Fi from her mobile. But Gross said she and her neighbours still regularly shared information about bushfires via their landlines.
A Telstra spokeswoman said the copper network was ageing and increasingly prone to faults, with repairs becoming harder as parts were no longer available.
“Where copper is damaged beyond repair, we will work with customers to move to newer technologies,” she said.
The spokeswoman said a satellite-based service provided more reliable voice and data services.
But RMIT senior research fellow Daniel Featherstone said heavy rain, fog or smoke could interfere with satellite or microwave signals to mobile towers, contributing to the challenges disaster-prone communities already faced.
He said extreme weather also resulted in power outages, which could sever phone reception when batteries ran flat in mobile towers.
“The challenge is ensuring reliability of services through these periods, so people can access emergency information and contact emergency services,” he said.
Featherstone, who lives in Castlemaine, said his community lost mobile reception during the recent Harcourt fires.
“These issues are real,” he said. “People couldn’t communicate with family or get messages from the police or service providers during that period.”
For Lindsay Grayson, the landline remains the best back-up system during an emergency in his hillside community. “We all rely on it,” he said.
He is frustrated that NBN Co appears unwilling to maintain the landline.
“I think it’s incredibly lame. Pathetic, actually,” he said.
Grayson believes $36,000 is a reasonable price for the multibillion-dollar company to pay for maintaining the existing system.
Scrimping for savings in a fire zone, he said, was just not worth it.

Here are Sunday's key updates on Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and the Middle East:
■ A senior Iranian official told Reuters that renewed U.S. talks for early March could lead to an interim deal, and that Tehran is considering various nuclear risk reduction measures, while reiterating that Iran's right to uranium enrichment. Iran will not give the U.S. control of its oil and mineral resources, but U.S. companies can act as contractors in Iran's oil and gas fields, the official said.
■ Northern Israeli Arab residents from Kfar Kanna reported hours of continuous gunfire and a grenade attack during a violent clash between two feuding families on Saturday night.
■ A 17-year-old Palestinian who was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank on Saturday has died of his wounds, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported.
■ U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff said U.S. President Donald Trump is "curious" as to why the Iranian government has not capitulated to U.S. demands in talks despite U.S. military pressure.
■ Eleven Arab and Muslim states issued a joint condemnation on Saturday of remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who said it "would be fine" if Israel controlled most of the Middle East.
■ Iran's Civil Aviation Organization issued notices warning aircrews to avoid flying over six areas across the country, according to several Saudi media outlets.
■ Two Palestinians were wounded after armed Israeli settlers opened fire on residents in the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah, Palestinian media reported.
Senior Iranian official: Iran offers nuclear risk reduction measures, will not give up uranium, oil and mineral resource control
Iran and the U.S. have differing views over the scope and mechanism to lift sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, a senior Iranian official told Reuters, adding that renewed talks have been scheduled in early March and could possibly lead to an interim deal.
In an effort to make progress on a nuclear deal, the official said Tehran can seriously consider a mix of exporting part of its highly enriched uranium stockpile, diluting its purity level and a regional consortium to oversee nuclear activities, while reiterating that Iran's right to uranium enrichment within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty must be recognized.
The official added that the country will not hand over control of its oil and mineral resources to the United States, but that U.S. companies can always participate as contractors in Iran's oil and gas fields.
Italian broadcaster apologizes after remark targets Israeli bobsleigh team
Italy's state broadcaster RAI was forced to apologize to the Jewish community on Saturday after an off‑air remark advising its producers to "avoid" the Israeli crew was broadcast before coverage of the Four-Man bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics.
The head of RAI's sports division had already resigned earlier in the week after his error-ridden commentary at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony two weeks ago triggered a revolt among its journalists.
On Saturday, viewers heard "Let's avoid crew number 21, which is the Israeli one," and then "no, because ..." before the sound was cut off.
Right-wing agitators briefly detained after protesting outside Arab-Israeli journalist's home
Right-wing agitators Mordechai David and Rami Ben Yehuda were released from police custody under restrictive conditions on Saturday night, after they were detained while protesting in front of the home of Arab-Israeli journalist Lucy Aharish.
David and Ben Yehuda entered Aharish's building and were recorded standing outside her front door with a megaphone. The two were detained for trespassing and disturbing the peace, and were released under a 14-day ban on contact with Aharish and a 14-day ban on contact with her.
According to additional recordings David shared online, he also attempted to block journalists Shai Golden and Raviv Drucker.
News 13 reported, "The police's response yesterday was swift, but the facts prove that the agitators are not deterred and are only escalating threats toward Lucy. A journalist who dared to speak her mind is living in fear, and the communication minister has fallen silent. The police minister's hand embraces convicted criminal Mordechai David and Minister Silman (Likud) praises him."
The incident occurred against the backdrop of comments Aharish made on air about growing violence in Arab society and upcoming elections: "The Arabs are the citizens of this country, whether you like it or not. In the upcoming elections, they will flock in huge numbers to the ballot boxes, Inshallah, to exercise their democratic right in the democratic Jewish state. Until then, on Saturday, they will go out to exercise another democratic right and protest against violence and the lack of governance."
Earlier this month, David admitted on Channel 13 that he pays protesters to disrupt left-wing protests, block opponents and disrupt conferences through his group Brotherhood for Justice - Together We Will Win.
Last month, David and far-right agitator Roi Star showed up at the homes of several left-wing activists and harassed them on camera. In a separate incident in the West Bank, David and Star tried to force their way into a building, broke down the front door, and filmed themselves pepper-spraying those inside.
'Non-stop shooting for many hours': Police arrest 34 suspects after shooting, grenade explosion in northern Israeli Arab town
Northern Israeli Arab residents of Kfar Kanna reported hours of continuous gunfire and a grenade attack during a violent clash between two feuding families on Saturday night.
One local resident described calling the police multiple times, only to be told that authorities were "handling it." Hours after a drone dropped a grenade on a house, police raided the town, arresting 34 suspects.
The violence left four wounded, including a 30-year-old in serious condition and three others in moderate condition: an 18-year-old, a 40-year-old, and an 80-year-old.
Ahmed Dhamsha, a local resident, told Haaretz that during the shooting last night, he hid with his children lying down, covering their heads with their hands. "What is happening is unbelievable, we have never experienced anything like this. Non-stop shooting for many hours, terrifying automatic gunfire. Feelings of fear," he said. "We called the police twice. They said they were handling it – I don't know what they were handling."
In the hours following the violence, a local leader held a reconciliation (sulha) between representatives of the two families.
IDF forces fatally shoot Palestinian teenager in West Bank, health officials say
A 17-year-old Palestinian who was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank on Saturday has died of his wounds, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported.
The teenager, Mohammed Wahabi Abdul-Aziz Hannani, was shot by Israeli forces in the village of Beit Furik, near Nablus. He was evacuated to a hospital in critical condition, where he later died.
Witkoff says Trump 'curious' why Iran hasn't capitulated to demands amid massive U.S. military presence
U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff said U.S. President Donald Trump is "curious" as to why the Iranian government has not acceded to U.S. demands in talks, in light of the mass mobilization of U.S. forces in the Middle East.
"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated,' because he understands he has plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't… I don't want to use the word 'capitulated,' but why haven't they capitulated?" Witkoff said on Fox News. "Why, under this pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'? And yet it's sort of hard to get them to that place."
Arab, Muslim states slam Huckabee for saying 'fine' for Israel to take over Middle East
Eleven Arab and Muslim states issued a joint condemnation on Saturday of remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who said it "would be fine" if Israel controlled most of the Middle East.
The foreign ministers who signed the statement categorically rejected Huckabee's "dangerous and inflammatory remarks," which they said "directly contradict the vision put forward by U.S. President Donald J. Trump" for the region, which they claimed is "grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence."
They said the statements "undermine these objectives, fuel tensions, and constitute incitement rather than advancing peace," adding that they "pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region."
The ministers warned that the "continuation of Israel's expansionist policies and unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine the prospects for peace and called for an end to these incendiary statements."
Signatories included the foreign ministers of the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bahrain, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the League of Arab States (LAS), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).

Trump says he is sending a hospital ship to Greenland
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump said on Feb 21 he was working with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry to send a hospital boat to Greenland, a Danish territory that Mr Trump has said he wants to acquire.
Mr Trump announced the plan on social media moments before hosting a dinner for Republican governors at the White House, where he sat next to and chatted with Mr Landry.
“Working with the fantastic Governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It’s on the way,” Mr Trump said.
Neither the White House nor Mr Landry’s office responded to queries about the post, whether the ship had been requested by Denmark or Greenland and which sick people needed help.
The Department of War had no immediate comment.
Danish King Frederik paid a second visit to Greenland
Greenland, Denmark and the US in late January held talks to resolve the situation following months of tensions within the NATO defence alliance.
Mr Trump’s post came hours after Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine in Greenland’s waters, seven nautical miles outside of Greenland’s capital, Nuuk.
It was unclear what connection Mr Landry had with the matter or if the post had any connection to the evacuation.

Pakistan Launches Fresh Attacks Inside Afghanistan Amid Rising Tensions

Pakistan said it launched strikes on seven militant sites inside Afghanistan in a "retributive response" to recent suicide attacks it said were carried out by Afghan-based extremists, as tensions escalated between the two South Asian neighbors.
Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts," the Information Ministry said early on February 22.
Islamabad said it had "conclusive evidence" that recent attacks inside Pakistan were carried out by Afghan-based extremists from the Tehrik-e Taliban (TTP) who were allegedly acting on instructions from "their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers."
The Pakistani ministry said it targeted the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, along with the TTP, also known as the Pakistani Taliban, in the strikes. It did not immediately provide details of the attacks or describe the evidence it said its intelligence agencies had gathered.
But Afghan officials said "dozens of people" had been killed and injured in the country's Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, "including women and children."
The claims from either side could not immediately be verified.
The renewed violence comes after hopes had been raised for an easing of tensions days earlier when Kabul released three Pakistani soldiers in a Saudi-mediated move following months of border clashes in the remote regions.
Suicide Attacks Inside Pakistan
A least four suicide attacks have been carried out in recent weeks. Three were in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, and one was in the capital, Islamabad, killing dozens of civilians and security personnel.
Islamabad alleged the extremist Taliban leaders of Afghanistan had failed to take "substantive action" against TTP militants despite repeated requests.
It urged Kabul to prevent the use of its territory for attacks against Pakistan by terror groups.
Afghanistan denies Pakistan's accusations that it is sheltering the Pakistani Taliban, which is an offshoot of the Afghan Taliban but appears to operate separately.
Tensions have escalated between the two countries since Pakistan conducted air strikes on Kabul in October 2025 and followed up with additional attacks on Afghan territory.
Dozens of soldiers from both sides were killed in artillery clashes and heavy gunfire last year before a cease-fire was agreed through Qatari mediation.
Lack Of Long-Term Solution
However, several rounds of talks mediated by Qatar and Turkey aimed at easing the tensions along the border have failed to bring about a long-term breakthrough.
Among the most serious attacks was a February 6 suicide bombing at a Shi'ite mosque in Islamabad that killed at least 32 people as they observed Friday Prayer.
The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which was the deadliest terror strike since 2008 in the Pakistani capital.
Fighting along the 2,600-kilometer frontier has forced the closing of several key border crossings and disrupted trade and movement.
Afghan's Taliban rulers have not been recognized by most of the world community as the legitimate government in the country and have been accused of extensive human rights abuses, especially against women and girls.

Ukraine explosions kill policewoman, wound 15 in 'terror' attack
Explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an "act of terror".
The blasts occurred shortly after police responded to a report of a break-in at a shop in the city centre around 12:30 am (2230 GMT Saturday), according to the Lviv regional prosecutor's office.
A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene.
Officials said a 23-year-old woman police officer was killed, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
"This is definitely an act of terror," Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy said in a Facebook post. "We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid, some of them are in very serious condition.
"One policewoman died. My condolences to the family and close ones," he added.
Lviv, close to the Polish border and far from the front line, has faced sporadic strikes and security incidents since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, but deadly explosions in the city centre remain rare.

Explosions rock Ukraine’s capital and outskirts as Russia launches mass missile attack, killing 1, injuring 2
Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
One man was killed after Russia launched a combined missile and drone attack at Kyiv and surrounding towns overnight on Feb. 22.
Wall-shaking explosions first took place in Ukraine’s capital at around 4:00 a.m. local time, according to Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground. More blasts were heard at approximately 4:30 a.m. local time, and continued intermittently throughout the early morning.
"The enemy is attacking the capital with ballistic weapons. Please stay in shelters until the all-clear signal is given," Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said during the attack.
An air raid alert was first issued by authorities at 3:56 a.m. local time. The alert was later extended to all of Ukraine at 4:47 a.m. local time as Russian bombers took off, according to the Air Force.
Kyiv Oblast governor Mykola Kalashnyk said on Sunday morning that the attack had killed a 49-year-old man in Fastiv, a town roughly 60 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.
"Two victims — a woman and a child — were hospitalized from the suburbs of the capital to hospitals in Kyiv," Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko also reported.
The attack also targeted the coastal region of Odesa in the south of Ukraine. Kamikaze drone attacks caused damage and fires to energy infrastructure, according to Oblast governor Oleh Kiper.
In response to Russia's strikes, the Polish Air Force said it deployed fighter jets to protect Polish airspace overnight.
"On-duty fighter pairs and an early warning aircraft were scrambled, and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems were brought to the highest level of alert," the statement read.
Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and energy infrastructure, as it continues to wage its war.
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
The two brothers were first injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added. The second Russian strike killed the two siblings.

Powerful explosions shook Ukraine's capital, Kiev, early Sunday, after officials warned of a possible ballistic missile attack and ordered residents into shelters.
The city's military administration issued the alert shortly before 0200 GMT, urging people to take cover immediately. Moments later, AFP journalists in Kiev heard several loud blasts.
"Attention! An air alert has been declared in Kiev due to the threat of the enemy using ballistic weapons," the administration said, calling on residents to remain in shelters until the alarm is lifted.
Regional authorities said air defence units were engaging drones detected over the wider Kiev region and reminded civilians not to film or post images of ongoing military activity.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Kiev, regularly targeted by Russian missile and drone attacks since February 2022, has faced waves of overnight strikes in recent weeks as Russia and Ukraine have intensified their winter assaults on each other’s energy and military infrastructure.
Last month, Russia agreed to a request from US President Donald Trump to halt air strikes on Kiev until February 1 amid harsh winter temperatures, and Ukraine said it was ready to reciprocate as Washington pushes for a diplomatic solution to end the war.
But after February 1, the two sides exchanged strikes and blame as talks mediated by the US have yielded little till now, except for occasional prisoner exchanges.

Rescue forces were sent to Nahal Amud Nature Reserve in the Upper Galilee on Friday after three teenagers encountered a dead body while hiking in the area, Maariv reported.
According to a post made on Facebook by Inbal Shoham, the mother of one of the teens who found the body, rescue forces refused to climb down the hiking path in order to reach the body. Instead, she wrote, they directed the teens remotely while a helicopter from the IDF search and rescue Unit 669 was en route.
"The gap... conduct of authorized bodies is simply disappointing," the mother wrote, describing how her son and his friends documented the body as instructed by police, directed the helicopter, and received contradictory instructions on how to handle the body.
"My son was asked to check its pulse," she wrote, "Afterwards he was instructed not to check, so that he wouldn't interfere with any evidence before a forensics team arrived - a logical decision on its own, but in the end forensics never came to the site, and the rescue was conducted."
Rescue forces label retrieval complex operation
Rescue forces announced that the operation had been complex, involving a series of rope systems in a difficult environment.
"Unfortunately, this is the fifth rescue in less than a week that the unit's volunteers have carried out, and two of them involved a person found dead," the unit stated.
N12 stated that the body had been present in the area for around 12 hours before being found, and that his car was found in a nearby parking lot.

Israeli Muay Thai (Thai boxing) fighter Ahavat Hashem Gordon beat his Turkish opponent on Saturday evening after the two had a tense face-off the day before.
On Friday after the weigh-in, Gordon, who wore an Israeli flag over his shoulders, faced Ali Konyuncu, and the two exchanged the customary threats before high-profile boxing matches.
During the heated exchange, Konyuncu lunged at Gordon's neck, and the two were both immediately restrained. Both tried to break free of the men holding them back, according to video of the event which circulated on social media. Despite the restraints, Konyuncu managed to kick Gordon in the midsection before the two were effectively separated.
The fight, held in Kaunas, Lithuania, on Saturday night, lasted only two rounds. The first round was inconclusive, with neither side able to gain a clear advantage.
In the second round, Konyuncu socked Gordon with an uppercut before Gordon knocked him to the floor with a blow to the head. When the two were pulled apart, Konyuncu was seen bleeding profusely from a wound on the side of his head, and the judges made the call to end the fight there, awarding the victory to Gordon.
Israel's Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar (Likud) responded to Gordon's win in a Twitter/X post late on Saturday night, saying: "Another brilliant victory for our Israeli fighter."
Israelis in combat sports
Israel has produced a number of excellent athletes in combat sports over the last several decades, including judokas Yael Arad and Oren Smadja, who won Israel its first two Olympic medals (silver and bronze, respectively), at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Since then, Israel has won several other Olympic medals in judo, and sent athletes - including world champion Muay Thai fighters Sarah Abraham and Nili Block - to a variety of high-level boxing competitions.
In November, the Israeli kickboxing delegation put on a strong showing at the World Championships in Abu Dhabi, returning home with 7 medals. The event featured around 2,000 athletes from approximately 85 countries.

Trump to raise US global tariff to 15% after Supreme Court ruling
Move comes as businesses seek repayment for the estimated $133bn the Trump administration has already collected.
United States President Donald Trump has doubled down on his new global tariffs, raising them from 10 percent to 15 percent, days after the Supreme Court struck down his sweeping levies on imports.
The move on Saturday came as businesses and governments around the world sought repayment for the estimated $133bn that Washington has already collected.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump announced the raise “effective immediately” and said the move was based on a review of the “ridiculous, poorly written and extraordinarily anti-American decision” issued by the Supreme Court on Friday.
By a six-to-three vote, the court had ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs, because the power to tax lies with the US Congress.
The court’s decision struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
Trump railed against the majority justices as “fools and lapdogs” in a news conference after the ruling, calling them an “embarrassment to their families”. He quickly signed an executive order – resting on a different statute, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – to impose the blanket 10 percent tariff, starting on Tuesday.
The 15 percent hike announced on Saturday is the highest rate allowed under that law.
However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended by Congress. No president has previously invoked Section 122, and its use could lead to further legal challenges.
It was not immediately clear whether an updated executive order was forthcoming.
The White House said the Section 122 tariffs include exemptions for certain products, including critical minerals, metals and energy products, according to the Reuters news agency.
Lawsuits
Trump wrote on Saturday that his administration will continue to work on issuing other permissible tariffs.
“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again,” he said.
The president has already said his administration intends to rely on two other statutes that permit import taxes on specific products or countries based on investigations into national security or unfair trade practices.
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic agenda, which he has used as a tool to address a range of goals – from reviving domestic manufacturing to pressuring other nations to crack down on drug trafficking, and pushing warring countries toward peace.
He has also wielded tariffs, or the threat of them, as leverage to extract trade concessions from foreign governments.
Federal data shows the US Treasury had collected more than $133bn from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December.
Since the Supreme Court’s ruling, more than a thousand lawsuits have been filed by importers in the US to seek refunds, and more cases are on the way.
While legally sound, the path forward for such claims is not straightforward, especially for smaller firms, said John Diamond, director of the Center for Tax and Budget Policy at Rice University.
“It’s pretty clear that they will win in court, but it’ll take some time,” Diamond said. “Once we get the court orders in effect, I don’t think those refunds will be all that messy for larger firms. Smaller firms are going to have a much more difficult time getting through the process.”
But foreign governments are managing “the real mess”, Diamond said.
“What do you do if you’re Taiwan, or Great Britain, and you have this existing trade deal, but now it’s kind of been turned upside down?”
The US-Taiwan trade deal lowers the general tariff on Taiwanese goods from 20 percent to 15 percent, the same level as Asian trade partners South Korea and Japan, in exchange for Taipei agreeing to buy about $85bn of US energy, aircraft and equipment.
The US-United Kingdom deal imposes a 10 percent tariff on imports of most UK goods, and reduces higher tariffs on imports of UK cars, steel and aluminium.
‘Pickpocketing the American people’
After the Supreme Court’s decision, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, told Fox News on Friday that those countries must honour their agreements even if they call for higher rates than the Section 122 tariffs.
Exports to the US from countries such as Malaysia and Cambodia would continue to be taxed at their negotiated rates of 19 percent, even though the universal rate is lower, Greer said.
Indonesia’s chief negotiator for US tariffs, Airlangga Hartarto, said the trade deal between the countries that set US tariffs at 19 percent, which was signed on Friday, remains in force despite the court decision.
The ruling could spell good news for countries like Brazil, which has not negotiated a deal with Washington to lower its 40 percent tariff rate but could now see its tariff rate drop to 15 percent, at least temporarily.
Governments around the world have reacted to the Supreme Court decision – as well as Trump’s subsequent tariff announcement – with a mix of cautious optimism, trepidation and frustration.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would coordinate a joint European stance before talks with Trump in early March, while Hong Kong’s secretary for financial services and the Treasury, Christopher Hiu, described the situation surrounding Trump’s new tariff moves as a “fiasco”.
With the November midterm elections in the US looming, Trump’s approval rating on his handling of the economy has steadily declined during his year in office.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed 34 percent of respondents saying they approved of Trump’s handling of the economy, while 57 percent said they did not approve.
Democrats, who need to flip only three Republican-held seats in the US House of Representatives in November to win a majority, have blamed Trump’s tariffs for exacerbating the rising cost of living.
They were quick to condemn Trump’s new tariff threat on Saturday.
Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he [Trump] does not care about you”.

Ancient Chinese astrology gets a Gen Z rebrand in Southeast Asia
Forget rituals and superstitions, today’s young professionals are using ‘bazi’ 10-year luck forecasts to plan their next career pivot
Yik Wai Chee doesn’t think of himself as a believer.
Yet for years, he has consulted bazi, the ancient Chinese system of elemental forecasting, as a kind of strategic gut check on his life.
“For me, it is just a long-term ‘luck check’ to see if there are general strategies I can adapt to get through some life challenges,” he said. “If it doesn’t cost me at all to adapt to new strategies, I will try it.”
He is careful not to overstate its influence. Bazi sits closer to tarot in its interpretive vagueness than to any hard forecast, he says. It doesn’t drive his decisions so much as occasionally inform them.
But in a region where young professionals are increasingly confronted with hectic schedules, rising living costs and the relentless pressure to get ahead, even interpretive vagueness has its appeal.
Across Southeast Asia, this ancient practice is finding a distinctly modern second life.

Hong Kong, UAE solidify financial links with deeper regulatory ties, digital assets focus
Transaction volume under Project mBridge surged over 2,500-fold from the early 2022 pilot levels to more than US$55 billion by November 2025
Deeper regulatory ties and a shared push for new growth sectors are expected to give fresh impetus to cross-border investment flows between China and the Middle East, according to industry players and a United Arab Emirates (UAE) regulator.
Hong Kong would benefit from the increased China-Middle East cooperation as the city develops into “a key hub for Middle Eastern capital to deploy in Asia and an important gateway for Chinese capital to go global to the Middle East,” said Linda Cai, inbound and outbound leader and head of China corporate finance at PwC China.
Transaction volume under Project mBridge, which makes settlements more direct and efficient between mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, surged over 2,500-fold from the early 2022 pilot levels to more than US$55 billion by November 2025, according to the US think tank Atlantic Council. Digital yuan, or e-CNY, accounted for over 95 per cent of the tally.
The January announcement to promote digital yuan’s cross-border payment role would “greatly facilitate bilateral economic and trade activities and personal exchanges”, according to Cai.
Combined with the mBridge project, China and the Middle Eastern countries would have formed a “multilevel financial cooperation framework of ‘currency-fund-digital assets’, laying a foundation for the mutual recognition of more cross-border products, such as exchange-traded funds and green bonds, in the future”, she said.

Tourists love this European paradise, but locals fear for its future
Valletta: Small boats are motoring across the grand harbour of Malta on a winter morning beneath a cloudless sky. The waves are low and the wind is down as the boatmen take their passengers, five or six at a time, across the gleaming blue water.
The only challenge for a tourist is to keep the balance in the traditional boat, known as a dghajsa tal-pass, and watch out for someone leaning out to take a selfie – a shift in weight that can tip the vessel on its side.
The conditions, in other words, are perfect. Malta looks like a nation free of troubles.
But this small part of Europe is showing the strain from years of strong growth, high migration, surging tourism and rapid cultural change. It also has a nagging problem that makes some of its citizens anxious about the future.
“I weep for my country,” says one business owner. He thinks it is too hard to find young Maltese workers to fill jobs, and he does not like the heavy reliance on migrant workers to run basic services.
Growth is good. The economy grew by about 4 per cent last year and is tipped to expand by 3.8 per cent this year, while major European countries drift. The national debt is 47 per cent of economic output; in France it is almost 120 per cent.
However, Kevin Cassar, a professor of surgery at the University of Malta and a regular commentator on national life, believes a shock is looming.
“The truth is that the lifestyles that people enjoy now cannot be sustained into the future unless there are radical changes,” he says.
“And those radical changes, with regards to income, will be painful changes. This is why no political party wants to go down that route.”
“People have become used to a certain quality of life, a certain level of earnings, and yet we have this bizarre situation where people are earning more, but the buying power of that income is significantly reduced.”
Malta is now having an urgent debate about family policies to make it easier for young couples to have children. Anna Borg, a professor at the University of Malta, is arguing for more paternity leave, extended maternity leave and greater action on gender equality.
“This can’t just be a responsibility for mothers. There must be opportunities for men to take an active role in caregiving,” she told The Times of Malta last year.
Housing is a key issue. Property prices have risen by about 75 per cent over the past decade, according to the Central Bank of Malta, and parents worry that their children will not be able to own their own homes.
Incomes are up, so the bank is not alarmed about affordability. The increase in migration, however, is a factor.
“Malta cannot rely indefinitely on population growth to maintain momentum,” the International Monetary Fund said this month. It noted that Malta’s population density was 15 times greater than the EU average and that this put a strain on housing.
From 2000 to 2023, the population grew from 391,000 to 563,000. One policy, a “golden passport” scheme to sell citizenship to foreign investors, rankled with the community and was stopped last year. But the biggest factor was the demand for workers to run essential services.
This means that 28 per cent of the population is of foreign nationality. From hospitals to hotels, the country relies heavily on its new residents.
Tourism keeps the demand strong. Malta hosted just over 4 million tourists last calendar year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. While the migrant intake in Malta is about the same as in Australia as a proportion of the population, the change feels too fast for some.
“It’s been a massive jump in a short space of time,” says Cassar. “So the main problem that we’re facing is the radical change.”
This kind of debate has fuelled the rise of the far-right in countries like Germany, but Malta has two major parties, Labour and the Nationalists, that dominate the parliament. Labour is in power. Cassar has family ties to the Nationalists, but his commentary in The Times of Malta criticises both sides.
Visitors can see how important migration has become. In Valletta, the capital, it is possible to eat at a restaurant serving Maltese food served by waiters from India who work for a manager from Albania and an owner from Malta.
As long as tourism grows, the demand for foreign workers will increase. As their society changes, some Maltese even worry about whether their language will survive in a digital world of artificial intelligence.
“The continuation of the country as a nation depends on the younger people,” says Cassar. “I think the measures that need to be taken need to be quite radical.”
He suggests restrictions on foreign investors buying property, tighter rules on short-term property rentals to tourists, a halt to the rapid migration of recent years and changes to inheritance rules so that grandparents can pass their assets to grandchildren, skipping a generation.
Malta is not alone in facing these challenges. Most countries in Europe are debating their welfare spending, education policies, migration settings and housing supplies. No EU nation has a fertility rate above the replacement rate, generally seen as 2.1 births per woman.
Australia is experiencing some of the same trends. The fertility rate in Australia is 1.5, also below replacement. Parents in Australia worry about housing affordability for their children, just as parents do in Malta.
The pressures, however, seem all the greater on these beautiful islands in the Mediterranean.
Malta is a small but tough nation that has defied conquering armies and navies for centuries. It will have to adapt to these changing times as well.

‘Technically British’: UK visa rule change unleashes confusion for dual citizens
Updated ,first published
Dual Australian-British citizens are discovering that nearly forgotten family links to the UK and Ireland may prevent them from entering the countries with a cheap online pass and instead require them to take out a foreign passport or certificate costing more than $1000.
The rule change, which affects anyone who is technically a British or Irish citizen regardless of whether they have taken steps to claim that nationality in practice, comes into effect on February 25 and has already upended itineraries.
As a result, dual citizens are ineligible for the inexpensive £16 ($30.50) ETA that now lets them travel to Britain. Instead, they will need a British or Irish passport.
“British citizens, including those who hold dual nationality, are not eligible to apply for an ETA, even if their other nationality (such as Australian) would normally require one,” the British High Commission stated. “This is because British citizens already have the right of abode in the UK.”
Dual citizens also have the option of obtaining a Certificate of Entitlement from the British government for a one-time fee of £589 ($1135), which can be used alongside a non-UK passport to enter the country. The Certificate of Entitlement can be applied for whether someone is within the UK or abroad.
The rule change has set off a string of panicked conversations between travel providers and Australians heading to the UK who may be unwitting British citizens by descent.
Lynton Jones, of Sydney-based travel agency The Savvy Traveller, said he had one customer born in 1943 to a father from the UK who immigrated to Australia in 1913 as a toddler.
The customer “never had, nor thought he could have, nor wanted” a UK passport, Jones said. “Now in his 80s, it would seem that he is technically classed as British by the UK government.”
More than 1.1 million people who were born in the United Kingdom were living in Australia in 2023, which makes it the largest migrant community in Australia, on ABS figures.
More than 2 million people in Australia have one or both parents born in the UK, 2021 Census figures show.
The UK government warns: “If you or your parents were born in the UK, you might automatically be a British citizen.” Irish-Australian dual citizens are also included in the rule change because of the long-standing Common Travel Area that provides reciprocal arrangements and shared travel area between the UK and Ireland.
Jones, the travel agent, says that although his client successfully applied for his ETA online, Jones noted that “his information is technically wrong”.
“If it was queried, he could be denied entry under the new rules upon arrival, even with his approved ETA in place.” With less than two months until departure, it is not clear what he should do.
“As a travel professional, I don’t want to give him wrong information, especially with the trip costing tens of thousands of dollars,” Jones said.
In another instance, a travel agent had to cancel and rebook a family’s long-awaited UK holiday when the travellers realised too late that they required UK passports and could not obtain them in time. The postponement came at “considerable financial and emotional expense”, the Australian Travel Industry Association wrote.
One affected traveller posted on a UK visa forum that they were born in the UK but had lived in Australia for 15 years. They applied for British passports for their two sons at the start of the year but have seen no progress. “It has been nearly a month since any update on our applications after sending them every bit of supporting documentation they need. I’m starting to panic now,” they wrote.
A UK passport – which requires periodic renewal – costs £108 for an online adult application in Australia and £70 for a child, plus a £19.86 courier fee (about $240 all up for an adult renewal). A typical four-week turnaround begins once initial documents are received. An Australian adult passport costs $422.
While the change affects 85 countries, it has sparked a firestorm among British and Irish Australians. “I think there is some confusion,” said Anthony Goldman, joint managing director of the Goldman Group, a travel agency that focuses on corporate and luxury travel. “Not everyone is going to register the change.”
The changes will also affect Australians with no claim to British citizenship. While ETAs have been used since October 2023, the new rule means they will be strictly enforced by British customs effective February 25. The ETA will become mandatory to board a plane for the UK.
Flight Centre notes: “Airlines will be legally required to verify an ETA before allowing travel for short visits, including tourism, business and transit.”
Despite the confusion, bookings remain strong. Flight Centre Corporate data shows bookings in January 2026 are up compared with a year ago. The British government maintains that “the introduction of ETAs is in line with the approach many other countries have taken to border security ... and helps prevent the arrival of those who present a threat to the UK”.
Goldman noted that Australians are generally “used to different visa entry requirements”, citing recent updates to European travel rules. “The difference is that this affects a lot of Australians because they’re British citizens by descent,” he said. “If someone has a father born in the UK 80 years ago, theoretically they will now need a UK passport.”
To clear up the confusion, the government has provided a “Check if you’re a British citizen” webpage, allowing travellers to confirm which documents they need and which queue they should join upon arrival.
Underscoring the complexity of citizenship rules, numerous Australian politicians were ejected from office in 2017-18 because they unwittingly were subjects of other countries. The constitution requires parliamentarians to hold only Australian citizenship.

‘Unjustified’: Australia rejects Trump’s latest tariff hit
Trade Minister Don Farrell will press the case against US President Donald Trump’s decision to increase the tariff rate on Australian goods from 10 to 15 per cent when he visits the United States this week.
Farrell’s long-planned trip, beginning on Tuesday, has coincided with the aftermath of Trump’s decision to strike back against the US Supreme Court’s rejection of his broader tariff regime by imposing a blanket 15 per cent tariff rate on the whole world.
Farrell said in a statement that Australia had “consistently advocated against these unjustified tariffs”.
“Australia believes in free and fair trade,” he said. “We are working closely with our embassy in Washington to assess the implications and examine all options.”
Trump’s late night announcement of the global tariff escalation, following the legal defeat of his first global tariff in a Supreme Court ruling that found the president did not have the power to impose import taxes unilaterally, has not moved past the stage of a social media post on Truth Social.
A second global tariff has not been issued as an executive order.
Farrell will depart on Tuesday for a previously scheduled trade mission to support the G’Day USA tourism event in Los Angeles, where he is expected to also meet with senior US government officials.
Australia had the lowest baseline tariff rate available under Trump’s previous regime at 10 per cent, though the administration had also negotiated varying deals on different types of imports with a range of countries.
Innes Willox, chief executive of industry representative group AiG, said the tariffs would have mixed consequences for Australian businesses.
“Some will get an immediate advantage, others will miss out, depending on how they trade and who they compete with,” Willox said. “But one experience will be universal, and that is dealing with the consequences of the uncertainty, which is cruelling investment, delaying purchasing decisions and creating unnecessary red tape.
“Almost 20 years ago, the top 20 economies came together to collectively respond to the Global Financial Crisis. The US is host of the G20 this year, and the rules-based trading system needs to be on the agenda. Businesses’ capacity to endure this kind of economic volatility is diminishing.”
CSL, one of Australia’s largest exporters to the United States, was contacted for comment, as were several mining, manufacturing and agricultural groups and companies.
A BlueScope spokesperson said the company didn’t provide running commentary on possible tariff changes. “We’ve been navigating tariffs since the previous Trump administration and we’ll continue to do so,” he said.
Opposition frontbencher James Paterson said Trump’s tariffs were contrary to Australia’s free trade agreement with the US and the nation’s long history of friendship with the superpower.
“I would hope that the president would consider an exemption for Australia from that tariff, and I hope that the Albanese government, with their new ambassador, Greg Moriarty, shortly to start in Washington DC, are able to secure that exemption for Australia,” Paterson said.
Canada and Mexico are exempt from Trump’s latest round of tariffs, though the president has also quarrelled with those nations.
Australia’s exports to the US totalled $23.8 billion in 2024. More recent data has swung wildly as gold exporters have raced to get ahead of changing tariff rules.
Last year, the Albanese government removed a major biosecurity barrier (that the White House had complained about) to US beef exports to Australia. The government described the move as the result of a science-based review but it also used it in talks with the Trump administration.
As cost-of-living fears rose in the United States in November, the White House exempted beef shipments from tariffs.

158 giant tortoises reintroduced to Galapagos island after more than a century

QUITO – More than 150 giant tortoises have been reintroduced to Floreana Island in Ecuador’s famed Galapagos archipelago where they disappeared more than a century ago, the Environment Ministry said on Feb 20.
Park rangers carried large crates containing the 158 tortoises on their backs, hiking 7km across volcanic terrain and hard-to-access areas before releasing them, the ministry said in a statement.
“For the first time in over a century, Floreana is once again home to giant tortoises, a species that plays a strategic role as ecosystem engineers: seed dispersers, vegetation regulators and promoters of natural habitat regeneration,” it said.
The Galapagos Islands, a World Heritage Site, are situated some 1,000km off the coast of Ecuador. They are famous for their unique flora and fauna and are where British scientist Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution.
An NGO, Island Conservation, said it was the first time that giant tortoises have walked on Floreana since the native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction there in the mid-1800s after the introduction of invasive mammals.
There are 13 living species of Galapagos tortoises on other islands in the archipelago, according to National Geographic. They can weigh more than 250kg. The oldest on record lived to be 175 years old.
The Ecuadoran ministry said the released tortoises come from a breeding centre of the Galapagos National Park, where a specialised programme was developed using tortoises with a high genetic load of the island’s endemic species that was found on Isabela island, which lies about 180km from Floreana.
Each tortoise underwent an extensive quarantine and was microchipped for identification before its release.
For a decade, researchers have been working to reintroduce 12 other endemic species to Floreana as part of a rewilding programme.
Floreana, covering 173 sq km, was the first to be inhabited by humans in the entire archipelago. AFP

Tehranis brace for ‘inevitable’ US-Iran war: ‘I am getting more scared’
‘I don’t want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground,’ a resident in the Iranian capital says
Tehran resident Hamid struggles to sleep as fears of renewed conflict haunt the Iranian capital after last year’s 12-day war with Israel.
“I don’t sleep well at night even while taking pills,” Hamid said, as he expressed concern for his “family’s health … my kids and grandchildren”.
The city woke up to blasts overnight from June 12 to 13 last year as Iran’s arch-enemy Israel launched an unprecedented military campaign.
The war erupted as Iran was preparing for another round of talks with the United States, which briefly joined Israel in attacking major Iranian nuclear sites.
The attacks prompted Iran to respond with drone and missile strikes, with thousands of people killed in Iran and dozens in Israel.
Iran has now resumed talks with Washington, with Iran insisting they be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.

Investments expert explains ‘three pot’ method for building savings
As the new tax year approaches in April, some people may be considering starting a new habit to build a pot of cash.
- Bookmark
Some people who are considering starting a new savings habit or building on an existing one as the new tax year approaches in April may be able to get a clearer idea of their savings goals by grouping them into separate “pots”, according to an investments expert.
Lucy Smith, an investment manger at Killik & Co, said that a “helpful” way to consider structuring savings can be to consider building an emergency pot of cash that can be accessed easily if needed.
Some people may want to aim to build up at least three months’ worth of spending in it, depending on their own circumstances and what they feel comfortable with, she said.
A “planned spend” fund could be a second pot, with money put by for foreseeable goals in the next few years, such as a home purchase, a big holiday or any other life expense.
Longer-term “lifetime” savings that will not be needed for around five years or more could be put into a third pot, Ms Smith suggested.
She said: “This is your pot of money where investing can play a key role as you can benefit from compounding over time since it is not money that you will need over the next few years.”
Ms Smith also said a consistent approach can help with building a savings habit.
She said: “One of the simplest ‘set and forget’ behaviours is using your Isa allowance regularly.”
Some savers might feel comfortable gradually moving from a cash Isa towards a stocks and shares Isa over time, she said.
Investments may potentially grow more strongly than savings held in cash over time. But the value of stocks and shares can go down as well as up, so people may want to consider the risk level they feel comfortable with.
Ms Smith said of the potential for funds to fall in value: “It’s worth considering whether this is something that would keep you up at night or if you would see it as a buying opportunity – and what you’d do if markets fell further.”

Staying diversified when investing and avoiding “putting all your eggs in one basket”, may be a useful goal, she said.
Ms Smith added that some people may want to get financial advice.
The Government-backed MoneyHelper website also has tips and tools to help people build savings.
Ms Smith said: “The type of investment habit you build can also be adapted by life stages, such as buying a home, starting a family or approaching retirement.”
She said of building wealth: “It’s about developing good habits over time.”

Ofgem price cap – what is happening to my energy bill?

Ofgem price cap – what is happening to my energy bill?
Changes following a promised £150 average cut to domestic bills mean households should become familiar with how much they pay per unit of energy.
- Bookmark
Latest predictions suggest Ofgem will reduce the energy price cap by £117 to £1,641 a year for a typical dual fuel household from April 1 when it makes its announcement on Wednesday.
– What is Ofgem’s price cap?
The energy price cap sets a maximum price that suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of gas and electricity they use.
It also sets a maximum daily standing charge – the cost of having your home connected to the grid.
The headline price cap figure provided by Ofgem indicates what a household using gas and electricity, and paying by direct debit, can expect to pay if their energy consumption is typical.
It is important to note that it does not limit a home’s total bills because people still pay for the amount of energy they use – so if it is above the average they will pay more, and if it is below they will pay less.
Energy is regulated separately in Northern Ireland.
– What’s changing with my energy bill this time?
The next price cap, which will take effect from April 1, will be the first to reflect Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ promise last November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill.
She is achieving this by shifting 75% of the Renewables Obligation (RO) costs from household energy bills into general taxation, and scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme introduced by the Tories in government which was funded by bills and designed to tackle fuel poverty by improving housing conditions, but which has been beset with delivery problems.
This will mainly translate through to customer bills by a cut to households’ electricity unit rates, with an expected reduction of around 3.37p per kilowatt hour (kWh) from the previous quarter.
– Why won’t I see a £150 discount on my bill?
The discount will be applied via a lower unit rate rather than a one-off amount.
It should also be stressed that the £150 figure is an average, and amounts will vary based on the size and type of household and how much energy they use.
Also, industry analysts Cornwall Insight have said the changes are likely to reduce the cap by about £145 a year once VAT and other pricing allowances are taken into account.
It added that increases in costs associated with the operation and maintenance of gas and electricity networks, which are paid for from customer bills, have offset part of these savings.
– Do I need to do anything?
Households should look out for information arriving from their suppliers after the price cut is announced, particularly around the rates they pay for each unit of gas and electricity.
This information will be important for those considering switching away from the price cap to a cheaper fixed tariff, and those looking for a new fixed tariff, as comparing unit prices is key to finding a good deal.
– Is now a good time to switch?
It is always worth investigating fixed deals, taking into account any length-of-time obligations that could result in exit fees.
As a rule of thumb, Which? recommends looking for deals cheaper than the price cap (this is where comparing gas and electricity unit rates is important, rather than looking at headline figures), not longer than 12 months and without significant exit fees.
However, the End Fuel Poverty Coalition said it understood that some fixed tariffs will include announced cuts from February 25, and some will not.
It warned that this could make switching and fixing – that is already confusing – “even more difficult to gauge”.
It said households may prefer to wait for the dust to settle on Wednesday’s announcement before signing up to a fixed term deal or changing supplier.
– Are prices going to keep going down, or should we expect increases in the future?
Cornwall Insight currently expects the price cap to remain relatively steady throughout 2026, with a small fall forecast in July.
However, it said these predictions may shift as wholesale markets change and potential policy cost announcements happen.

Households set for lower energy bills amid price cap shake-up

Price cap: Energy bills set to plummet from April – what it means for you
Rachel Reeves said last November that £150 would be cut from the average household bill from April
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Households are poised to see their energy bills fall by approximately 7 per cent from April, following a government pledge for an average £150 reduction.
Industry predictions suggest energy regulator Ofgem will announce a £117 cut to the energy price cap on Wednesday, bringing the annual cost for a typical dual fuel household down to £1,641 from 1 April.
This anticipated reduction aligns with earlier government indications of a £150 saving, partly achieved by discontinuing the Energy Company Obligation (Eco) scheme, originally introduced by the Conservative government.
However, consumers are cautioned not to anticipate a straightforward £150 discount, as the actual saving will fluctuate depending on household size, type, and energy consumption. The primary method for this reduction is expected to be a lower price per unit of electricity.
Households are advised to await information from their suppliers following the cap announcement for specific details.
Energy analysts Cornwall Insight project the changes will ultimately reduce the cap by around £145 annually, once VAT and other pricing allowances within the cap methodology are considered.
It added that increases in charges associated with the operation and maintenance of Britain’s energy networks have offset part of the savings.
Wholesale prices had also risen slightly since its last forecast in December, with the cost of gas particularly volatile due to “geopolitical factors”.
Looking further ahead, Cornwall said wholesale costs were still lower than when Ofgem set the January cap level and it expected the cap to remain “relatively steady” throughout 2026, “with only a small rise forecast in July”.
Ned Hammond, deputy director of customer policy at Energy UK, which represents firms, said: “At a time when many households are struggling with their bills, action taken by the Government to provide a considerable discount on energy bills is hugely welcome.
“While the saving will be £150 for the average household, it is important to note that the discount is applied to the unit rate. Therefore, households will experience significantly different savings depending on their energy consumption, some much higher and others substantially lower than £150.
“In addition, other moving parts, such as network charges and wholesale costs, mean energy bills will not necessarily fall in line with the saving provided. Indeed, the price cap is projected to drop by around £115 from 1 April.”
Which? energy editor Emily Seymour said: “Households can expect a significant cut to their energy bills in April, which will come as a relief to millions of people struggling with cost-of-living pressures.
“The bulk of this change is expected to be applied to your electricity price per unit, so your exact savings will depend on your usage; look out for communications from your energy provider in the coming weeks to see how it will affect your bills.”
Simon Francis, co-ordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, urged households to note the changes in unit costs and standing charges, rather than focus on the headline “average energy bill”.
He said: “We know that energy bills can be confusing and trying to decide when to switch tariffs or change supplier is a big decision which can overwhelm people.
“As well as setting the price cap, Ofgem should play a greater role in ensuring that the tariffs reaching the market are fair and don’t discriminate against specific customer groups.
“Sadly the responsibility currently falls to households to pay careful attention to any changes in their unit costs and standing charges.”

Man charged with driving forklift through Perth shopping centre, attempting to steal ATM
A Perth man who stole a forklift and drove it through a local shopping centre in a bid to steal an ATM has been charged with dozens offences.
Detectives from Mirrabooka and Joondalup said on Sunday they had jointly charged the man after finding him allegedly responsible for a number of incidents in Balcatta and Greenwood earlier this month.
Police said detectives from both districts realised they were looking for the same man after he broke into a shopping centre on Calectasia Street in Greenwood on February 11.
It is alleged he used power tools to break in to an ATM, and stole a “large sum of money”.
Five days later, police say he stole a forklift from a Balcatta business before he drove it to Centuria Northlands on Wanneroo Road.
It is alleged he drove through the centre and tried to remove an ATM, but was ultimately unsuccessful. There was significant damage to both the shopping centre and the teller machine.
Police said they worked together and soon determined the same man was wanted over both of the incidents, and they executed a search warrant at a home in Alexander Heights this week.
The man was staying at the property and he was arrested, and a search of the house found an allegedly stolen truck, drugs and cash.
“Further inquiries identified the truck had been stolen from a business in Balcatta in early January 2026
and had been used in a series of commercial burglary offences,” a WA police spokesperson said.
The 52-year-old man has been charged with more than a dozen offences, including drug possession, aggravated burglary and theft.
WA police metropolitan assistant commissioner Martin Haime said the arrest showed good work by the detectives involved.
“If you choose to offend, understand this clearly: our squads work together, we share intelligence, and we will find you,” he said.
“If you target our community, expect to be caught.”

Migraine is more than just a headache. A neurologist explains the four stages

Migraine is more than just a headache. A neurologist explains the four stages
A migraine attack is not just a "bad headache".
Migraine is a debilitating neurological condition that can cause nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light or sound, in addition to severe headaches.
Migraine affects roughly five million Australians, but few people understand the different stages of a migraine attack.
Knowing the four distinct phases can help you recognise the symptoms and manage pain at each stage.
Phase 1: Premonitory
The first phase of migraine development is the "premonitory" or "prodrome" phase. It functions like a warning period, which begins 24 to 48 hours before a migraine attack fully sets in.
The premonitory phase has a lot to do with the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that regulates key functions such as body temperature, appetite, mood and sleep.
When a person experiences a migraine attack, their hypothalamus becomes abnormally activated. The hypothalamus is connected to other parts of the brain with different functions, so this abnormal activation can also disrupt how those parts function.
This can lead to symptoms such as poor concentration, food cravings, irritability and insomnia. If you notice these early signs, you're more likely to "catch" the start of a migraine attack and be able to treat it early.
Phase 2: Aura
The second phase of a migraine attack is called "aura". Aura refers to various neurological symptoms that affect your vision, speech or ability to feel sensations. Visual auras, which mainly affect your vision, are the most common kind.
Visual aura symptoms can include seeing flashing lights, swirling shapes or blind spots. A sensory aura can lead to numbness or tingling in your face or limbs. In severe cases, people may even have trouble speaking.
Research suggests a process called cortical spreading depression contributes to aura symptoms. During this process, a wave of electrical activity spreads very slowly through the brain and can impact how certain brain regions function.
Only 30 per cent of people experience migraine with aura.
Phase 3: Headache
The third phase of a migraine attack is the headache. This is when people typically experience a throbbing or pulsating headache, alongside other symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light and sound.
This phase usually lasts between four and 72 hours if untreated.
When different brain networks become activated during a migraine attack, other symptoms can develop in addition to headache.
When the medulla or "vomit centre" of the brain is abnormally activated, it can lead to nausea and vomiting.
The trigeminal nerve, the nerve, which allows you to feel sensations on your face, can also become abnormally activated. This causes the release of chemicals that may be perceived by the brain as pain.
One of these chemicals is a protein called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Some injectable types of migraine medication block this protein to reduce pain.
Phase 4: Postdrome
The fourth and final phase is the "postdrome". It is also known as the "migraine hangover".
During this recovery phase, your brain is working hard to return to its normal functioning. That is why you may feel even more fatigued or have difficulty concentrating after a migraine attack.
So, how can I manage a migraine attack?
It helps to know the symptoms and stages of migraine development.
If you have predictable symptoms, particularly during the premonitory phase, it's best to carry pain medications or anti-nausea tablets with you. That way you can treat early symptoms as soon as they arise. It can also be a sign to rest, ideally before the headache phase sets in.
In the aura phase, taking migraine-specific pain medications such as triptans, aspirin or anti-inflammatory pain killers may stop the headache phase from starting.
If you have more than four migraine attacks each month, you may also consider taking preventive medications. These are usually daily tablets that help control the baseline level of head pain you experience. Injectable options are also available.
Finally, don't ignore the postdrome phase. If you push yourself too hard during this recovery period, you may experience overlapping migraine attacks. This is when one migraine attack starts before the last one resolves itself. Overlapping migraine attacks are much harder to treat.
You may also experience other symptoms related to the migraine attack. These can include dizziness, neck pain, or ringing in the ears. If you have any of these additional symptoms, you should consult your neurologist to check they are not caused by a more serious underlying condition.
And if you are a woman who experiences migraine with aura, speak to your doctor before starting hormone-based contraception. This is because you may need different treatment to someone who does not experience aura symptoms.
By understanding the different phases and symptoms of migraine, you will be better equipped to tackle any future attacks.

Trump’s in a presidential pickle as the Supreme Court finds a spine

Trump’s in a presidential pickle as the Supreme Court finds a spine
Now that the third branch of the US government has explained to the second branch that the first branch matters, President Donald Trump is in a pickle.
He may need a distraction even bigger than bombing Iran and releasing secret files on UFOs and aliens. He may need to produce Marvin the Martian for an Oval Office meeting and install him on the “Board of Peace”. (Maybe it should be spelled “Bored of Peace,” since Trump seems itchy to attack Iran, and security guards protecting the Azerbaijani president, who’s on the board, were apparently beating up protesters outside the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Washington.)
Friday was a landmark day in the Trump reign. It was refreshing to finally see someone tell this petulant man-child: “No, you can’t do that!” And it was especially refreshing that the Supreme Court, which has been awash in its own ethics crises and acting subservient to the megalomaniac in the White House, suddenly found a spine.
The highest court firmly instructed the Emperor of Chaos on why his tariffs were unconstitutional without the blessing of Congress. And the president responded in the way he always does when he doesn’t get his way: with a Regina George hissy fit.
In a news conference on Friday afternoon, with the lights dimmed to be more flattering, Trump made clear that he was “absolutely ashamed” of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Justice Neil Gorsuch and their three brethren-sisters on the left who shut down his erratic, perverse — sometimes personally vindictive — tariff antics.
Trump railed that the court’s liberals were “a disgrace to our nation” and that the conservatives who joined the majority opinion were merely “fools and lapdogs for the RINOs (Republicans in name only) and the radical left”. He whined that the majority did not have “the courage to do what’s right for our country”. The man who expects fealty singled out two of his picks, Gorsuch and Barrett, calling their decision “an embarrassment to their families”.
As usual, Trump absurdly conflated what he wants with what’s best for the country. And as usual, he projected, charging that the justices who blocked his tariffs were “unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution” — and controlled by foreign interests. Actually, that critique is probably more applicable to the president, not the Supreme Court justices who put the brakes on Trump’s mad careening.
And Trump was barking up the wrong tree on lapdogs. Until now, Roberts, Gorsuch and Barrett have been lapdogs for Trump, helping to upend Roe, giving him immunity for nearly all official acts, weakening the Voting Rights Act, letting DOGE get its grimy little hands on private data and allowing Elon Musk’s backpack wolf pack to slash the federal workforce.
The Constitution is vague on so much, and that has allowed Trump to shimmy through wormholes and do things we assumed he would be barred from doing — like tearing down the East Wing without checking with anyone and letting foreign oligarchs enrich him, his family and his cronies. But the Constitution is clear on tariffs: They are the purview of Congress.
Trump has called tariffs “the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary”. And having his toy yanked away — even for the time it took him to figure out some other ploy to punish countries — brought out his fiendish side. After his unhinged news conference, he let fly a couple of long, unhinged Truth Social posts.
No sooner did moderate Republicans exhale, because they would no longer have to defend Trump’s mercurial tariff scheme — essentially a tax on consumers — than the president signed an executive order on Friday night invoking the Trade Act of 1974, imposing a “Global 10% Tariff on all Countries”. (On Saturday morning, he said he was upping it to 15 per cent.) He had crowed earlier at the news conference that he can not only destroy the trade of any country but also that he “can destroy the country”.
“I’m allowed to destroy the country,” he pouted to reporters, “but I can’t charge them a little fee.”
With Trump’s power grabs, the court finally provided some accountability. Meanwhile, the awful wait to assign blame in the Jeffrey Epstein case, involving powerless young women, continues. The only real justice so far, in this lurid saga of bad, bad men from all around the globe, is that a predatory woman is in jail.
Sure, Les Wexner, the former Victoria’s Secret mogul who gave Epstein power of attorney over his vast fortune, was deposed by the House Oversight Committee this past week. But he played Mr Magoo, crying that Epstein had “conned” him. It was totally unbelievable. Clearly, Wexner was infatuated with Epstein and enabled the monster to acquire the private plane and private island that lured so many famous people into his web.
King Charles, too, gave us a rare blast of accountability this past week. He didn’t stand in the way when British police arrested his brother, the former prince Andrew, for reportedly passing confidential information to Epstein. It was gratifying to see the stunned, slack look on Andrew’s face as police took him away from his mansion in Norfolk. He is still, however, dodging accusations that he committed sex crimes.
Trump has been madly deflecting from his friendship with Epstein, acting as though he barely knew him, even though it’s clear that hound recognised hound. Trump, Melania, Mar-a-Lago and other related words or phrases are mentioned over 38,000 times in the Epstein files.
And now, the president will also have to distract from his humiliation at being slapped back by a conservative Supreme Court. He’s no doubt going to spend the weekend rewriting his State of the Union address and thinking of more nasty jibes for the justices who choked his leash.
And who knows? We may even see Marvin the Martian show up in the Oval Office, carrying a cookbook titled How to Serve Man.

US govt probes Netflix’s power over filmmakers in Warner deal review
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US Justice Department’s (DOJ) investigation of Netflix’s proposed US$72 billion (S$91.1 billion) takeover of Warner Bros.
Discovery includes scrutiny of the streaming giant’s behavior and whether it wields anticompetitive leverage over creators in negotiations for acquiring programming.
The department is seeking to determine whether the deal “may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act or Section 2 of the Sherman Act”, according to a copy of a civil investigative demand reviewed by Bloomberg News that was sent on Feb 20. It went to an independent movie studio, according to people familiar with the matter.
The language in the demand, an administrative subpoena that has not been previously reported, is the clearest sign yet that the Trump administration is going beyond a standard deal review as it investigates the merger, refuting an argument by Netflix in recent weeks that the government is not engaged in anything beyond the typical process.
The broad scope of the review is also a strong indication that it will take many more months before the government decides whether to challenge the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal in court – a delay that may benefit rival bidder Paramount Skydance.
“Netflix operates in an extremely competitive market. Any claim that it is a monopolist, or seeking to monopolise, is unfounded,” Netflix Chief Legal Officer David Hyman said in a statement. “We neither hold monopoly power nor engage in exclusionary conduct and we’ll gladly cooperate, as we always do, with regulators on any concerns they may have.”
The application of both laws has precedent, and the investigation may not result in any federal action. But deal reviews are typically conducted by US antitrust enforcers using just the Clayton Act, which is specifically for merger investigations. The Sherman Act is a statute more typically used to target illegal monopolization by a single company such as Alphabet’s Google, Live Nation Entertainment and Visa.
The DOJ is asking questions about Netflix’s ability to leverage its market power in negotiations with independent content creators such movie studios and filmmakers, according to the people. Netflix operates the largest paid video streaming service in the world and is one of the largest buyers of film and TV programming in the world.
Netflix is spending about US$20 billion on programming in 2026, which is split between original series and licensed reruns. Many of its most popular original programs, including Wednesday and Nobody Wants This, are produced by third-party studios. In buying HBO and Warner Bros., Netflix would acquire one of the largest studios as well as a major competitor in streaming.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that the DOJ’s review includes Netflix’s business practices and whether the deal would give the streaming giant monopoly power in the future.
“We have not been given any notice or seen any other sign that the DOJ is conducting a monopoliaation investigation,” Mr Steve Sunshine, head of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP’s global antitrust/competition group representing Netflix, said in a statement.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to request for comment outside of normal business hours. Warner Bros. declined to comment.
Monopoly cases can require market concentration of more than 50 per cent, a number that exceeds Netflix’s share with or without Warner Bros. Netflix accounts for about 9 per cent of TV viewing in the US and a larger share of the streaming market, and its spending on programming is comparable to peers such as Disney and Comcast.
Warner Bros. earlier this week committed to resume talks with Paramount after a representative of the company indicated a willingness to raise its offer price by US$1 per share to US$31. Warner Bros. has given Paramount a deadline of Feb 23 to submit its “best and final” offer.
Paramount, which launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros.
However, the offer could still be slowed down by an ongoing review in the EU, and US enforcers in the past have sued to block deals that they had initially waved through. Paramount could also face a gauntlet of US state attorneys general. BLOOMBERG

Arab, Muslim countries slam US ambassador's Israel remarks
Arab and Islamic countries issued a joint condemnation on Sunday of remarks by US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of right-wing political commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: "It would be fine if they took it all."
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments - alongside three major regional organisations - issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory".
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They said the comments contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador's words as "reckless" and "irresponsible", while Jordan said it was "an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region".
Kuwait decried what it called a "flagrant violation of the principles of international law", while Oman said the comments "threatened the prospects for peace" and stability in the region.
Egypt's foreign ministry reaffirmed "that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands".
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank".
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations".
Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of antisemitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes - a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.

Berlin International Film Festival winners blast Israel in award speeches, ignore Iran

The 76th Berlinale, the Berlin International Film Festival, which opened with a press conference in which the International Jury, headed by master director Wim Wenders, was blasted for refusing to condemn Israel, ended Saturday night with an awards ceremony in which multiple winners had harsh words about the war in Gaza.
Abdallah Al-Khatib, who won the Best Feature Debut prize for his film Chronicles From the Siege, criticized the German government, saying it was complicit in Israel’s conduct in the war against Hamas.
“People have told me to be careful… but I don’t care,” he said. “You are partners in the genocide of Gaza by Israel, but you choose not to care. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world.”
He went on to say, “I’m happy to be here to get this prize, but I’m Palestinian, so I have to use this moment to speak about Palestine. I was under a lot of pressure to participate in the Berlinale for one reason only, to stand here and say that Palestinians will be free and one day, we will have a great film festival in the middle of Gaza, in the middle of other Palestinian cities… Our festival will stand in solidarity with the people living under siege, under occupation and under dictatorships around the world. We will speak about politics before cinema. We will speak about resistance before art, about freedom before beauty, and about a human being before culture, the long-awaited day is coming.”
Given the persecution of the LGBT community in Gaza, though, it is hard to imagine the film festival Al-Khatib envisioned welcoming such movies as What Will I Become?, a movie that explores “the vulnerability of their transmasculine community” and that won the Amnesty International Award at the Berlinale.
Co-director Logan Rozos said, accepting the award, “Thank you to trans women all over the world for being the model and the blueprint for how to destabilize the patriarchy.” It would seem that the “long-awaited day” that a film like Rozos’s will be shown in Gaza will not be coming anytime soon.
Few film festival winners mention Iran
Not surprisingly, many fewer prizewinners chose to criticize the Iranian government, where numerous filmmakers have been arrested, harassed, and killed in recent weeks as they took part in recent demonstrations against the regime.
Among the few who did mention Iran was Emin Alper, whose movie, Salvation, set in the Kurdish region of Turkey, won the Grand Jury Prize. In his acceptance speech, he spoke about, “People in Iran suffering under the most terrible tyranny,” and also about “the genocide in Palestine.”
The movie that won the Golden Bear, the festival’s highest profile award, was German-Turkish filmmaker İlker Çatak's Yellow Letters, about a playwright and actress engaged in political theater in Turkey who find themselves targeted by the state.
At the awards ceremony, Wenders addressed the controversy sparked by his refusal to speak out politically at the beginning of the festival, by saying, “The language of cinema is empathetic, the language of social cinema is effective. The dignity and protection of human life - these are our causes as well. You do necessary and courageous work, but does it need to be in competition with ours? Do our voices need to clash?”
The Berlinale’s director, Tricia Tuttle, also brought up the issue at the awards ceremony, saying, “Criticism and speaking up is part of democracy, and so is disagreement. If this Berlinale has been emotionally charged, that’s not a failure of the Berlinale, and it’s not a failure of cinema. That’s the Berlinale doing its job, and that’s cinema doing its job.”

China may be in work on development of nuclear weapons’ new generation — CNN

NEW YORK, February 22. /TASS/. US intelligence agencies believe that China is developing a new generation of nuclear weapons and has already conducted at least one test as part of the process to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, CNN reported citing its unnamed sources.
According to the sources, granted investments in the nuclear arsenal will enable China to be allegedly able to have technical capabilities that none of the dominant nuclear powers currently possess.
"China secretly conducted an explosive nuclear test in June 2020 at the Lop Nur facility, in the country’s northwest - despite a self-imposed moratorium on such activity that has been in place since 1996 - and was planning to do more in the future, according to the sources and recent statements from US officials," CNN stated in its report.
"Evidence collected as part of a subsequent review of the June 2020 event, has led US officials to conclude the test was motivated by China’s pursuit of next-generation nuclear weapons," the US-based broadcaster continued citing sources familiar with the situation.
"That includes efforts to develop additional weapons systems capable of delivering multiple, miniaturized nuclear warheads from a single missile… China also appears to be developing low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons - something the country has never previously produced…," CNN added.
Earlier, Russian envoy to international organizations in Vienna Mikhail Ulyanov pointed out at his meeting with CTBTO (Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) Executive Secretary Robert Floyd that US attempts to accuse China of conducting nuclear tests are groundless.

Huckabee fires back at Tucker Carlson after interview descends into Israel-smearing

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee responded to conservative commentator Tucker Carlson in a series of posts on X/Twitter, after an interview at Ben-Gurion airport on Wednesday resulted in several unverified claims and assertions made by Carlson to discredit Israel.
"If Tucker was really a 'journalist,' he could have found out what I easily did later," Huckabee stated on Friday evening in response to one claim by Carlson that Israel had sheltered accused sex offender Tom Alexandrovich.
Carlson used Alexandrovich as an example of what he claimed were “dozens and dozens” of accused sex offenders in the United States who had fled to Israel. Huckabee, however, accused Carlson of intentionally misleading the public on the issue.
According to Huckabee's post, Alexandrovich, an Israeli citizen, had not violated any court orders by returning to Israel after his arrest in Nevada in August 2025 - he had been released on bail, and appeared before the court as scheduled via Zoom, pleading not guilty.
"Tucker's question wasn't because he was concerned about a child being solicited for sex," Huckabee accused, "He was playing 'gotcha.'"
Carlson also claimed that President Isaac Herzog had visited Epstein Island and challenged the ambassador to check for himself. Huckabee refuted Carlson's claims, adding that, "Tucker may need to talk to his lawyers. Libel & defamation of a good & honorable man is reckless."
In a video posted on X/Twitter in the early hours of Sunday morning, Carlson backtracked his claims about Herzog, stating that he had received a letter from the president's office claiming unequivocally that Herzog had never had any interaction with Epstein. Carlson issued a formal apology for stating otherwise and admitted to having acted without concrete information on the accusation.
Huckabee also reacted to a conversation the two had over the meaning of Zionism, describing the discussion as "very twisty and frankly confusing."
Carlson, Huckabee said, insisted on inserting topics which "have nothing to do with theology and certainly not with Israel, Zionism, or anything else." In his response on X/Twitter, Huckabee provided Carlson with what he believed to be a straightforward definition of Zionism: "Zionism is the belief that Israel has a right to exist in safety and security."
"Why can't you just say that?" Huckabee asked Carlson, claiming that he'd asked the commentator the question several times during the interview without receiving a clear answer. "You refused to say whether or not Israel has a right to exist. I hope you will state your answer to that simple question soon."
Huckabee accuses Carlson of spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories
Huckabee accused Carlson of muddying the waters of their conversation with the so-called "Khazar theory" of modern Jewish origin, a debunked idea that claims that most Ashkenazi Jews today trace their lineage to the population of Khazaria.
"This odious conspiracy theory is peddled by the likes of Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes and by people who love David Duke," Huckabee stated, "as well as Islamist accounts that make up false smears about Israel non-stop and are run out of countries like Pakistan and Turkey."
Huckabee also commented on Carlson's history of interviewing Nazis, saying, "I was expecting a thoughtful conversation and that he would ask questions and give me the opportunity to actually respond - just like he did with the little Nazi sympathizer Nick Fuentes or the guy who thought Hitler was the good guy and Churchill the bad guy."

Crutches in hand and her left foot in a brace, Chloé Harrouche, founder and artistic director of Loulou de Saison, quickly brushed aside the inconvenience when she met M Le magazine du Monde a few days before Christmas at her women's ready-to-wear brand's headquarters.
With its majestic wrought-iron staircase, herringbone parquet flooring, moldings, tasteful furniture and bright spaces, the Parisian offices where she set up her design studio in July 2024 reflect the style of the clothes she designs; elegant and minimalist. Still, they are far from austere, despite what the succession of black, white or gray pieces lined up in the showroom might suggest.
Before making its way into wardrobes, Loulou de Saison was the name of an Instagram account like hundreds of others. The page was run by a young Parisian passionate about fashion, showcasing her sense of style. But unlike many influencers who try, often unsuccessfully, to turn their dream into reality – namely, designing a wardrobe and building a lasting brand – Harrouche appears to have achieved her goal.

Australia denies it is working to repatriate Islamic State family members

Australia's center-left government on Sunday rejected a local media report that said it was working to repatriate Australians in a Syrian camp holding families of suspected Islamic State terrorists.
The 34 women and children were released on Monday from the camp in northern Syria, but returned to the detention center due to technical reasons. The group is expected to travel to Damascus before eventually returning to Australia, despite objections from ruling and opposition lawmakers.
On Sunday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke rejected claims made in a report in the Sunday Telegraph, asserting that official preparations were under way for the cohort’s return.
"In that report, it makes a claim that we are conducting a repatriation. We are not," Burke told Australian Broadcasting Corp television.
"It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not," Burke added.
Albanese says government will not help Islamic State family return to Australia
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who leads Australia's Labor Party, said this week his government would not help the group return to Australia.
The return of relatives of suspected IS terrorists is a political issue in Australia, which has seen a surge in popularity of the right-wing, anti-immigration One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson.
Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim terrorist group, is listed as a terrorist organization in Australia, with membership of the group punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Australia also has the power to strip dual nationals of citizenship if they are an Islamic State member.

Market hall, light rail and cable cars: How the City of Perth could shed the “dull” tag

Market hall, light rail and cable cars: How the City of Perth could shed the “dull” tag
A new report to be presented to Perth city council recommends making the central business district home to light rail, a market hall, more bikes lanes and introducing a cable car to bring tourists down from Kings Park.
The report Shaping Perth city centre: towards 2036 and beyond was developed by urban design and strategy firm Ghel throughout last year and will come before council on Tuesday for consideration.
It highlighted a number of challenges currently being dealt with by the city - including its well known “dull” moniker.
“Many Perthlings still view it as quiet and dull and this study aims to change that, creating a city centre that is lively, exciting, and the most attractive place to live, work, and visit in the metropolitan area,” the report said.
It found there had been a 390 per cent growth in the City of Perth’s residential population between 2009 and 2023, with the number expected to climb after Edith Cowan University opened its city-based campus this year.
“Despite recent growth in the number of people calling the city centre home, residential density remains relatively low compared to other Australian cities,” the report said.
“This lack of a critical mass of residents combined with changing retail trends means the 24/7 energy expected from a city centre is often missing.”
Researchers said Perth should aim to draw inspiration from shopping malls in Berlin, main pedestrian thoroughfares in Sydney, opportunities to embed Indigenous culture from Auckland, street design from Vienna and cycling paths from Copenhagen.
The report said one of Perth’s biggest challenges was the continued over-reliance on private transport. It found the CAT bus system was hard to navigate, fragmented cycling paths and key thoroughfares being used as freeway on and off ramps.
It suggested on-street parking should be mainly for short-users or loading docks, the speed limit should be lowered to 30 kilometres an hour and potentially sink the freeway under tunnels to “reconnect the urban fabric”.
The report’s authors also said light rail - such as trams - could be put on St George’s Terrace and Wellington Street to ease traffic, and recommended a cable car from Kings Park down to the city for tourists.
It also acknowledged Perth’s long-maligned retail spaces, and recommended a market hall be established in the city.
“Hay Street Mall has struggled as a retail-only precinct and should evolve into a vibrant street centred around food and beverage offerings, and entertainment-based offerings,” the report said.
“This transition should be actively curated, with a focus on small-scale independent operators offering unique WA culinary and artisan products.”
Specific plans to help Perth’s homeless population were only mentioned once in the report, saying the city should “collaborate with relevant agencies to ensure vulnerable groups, including people experiencing homelessness, are supported through well-resourced public amenities and visible services, particularly around transport hubs and the malls.”

Ukraine war briefing: Kyiv condemns ‘blackmail’ by Hungary and Slovakia in energy supplies dispute

Ukraine’s foreign ministry has condemned what it describes as “ultimatums and blackmail” by Hungary and Slovakia on Saturday, after both governments threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil. Hungary has also threatened to block a €90bn Ukrainian war loan.
-
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since 27 January, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment in western Ukraine. Hungary and Slovakia both accuse Ukraine of delaying the restart, without evidence. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement the country “rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries”. “Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
-
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine. The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and Nato but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate ties with Moscow. The Slovak leader, Robert Fico, has accused Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy of acting “maliciously” towards his country.
-
Russia attacked Ukraine overnight with dozens of strike drones and ballistic and cruise missiles, focusing on energy infrastructure, officials said on Sunday. The strikes hit Kyiv and the region around the capital, the Black Sea port Odesa and central Ukraine, they said.
-
Powerful explosions shook Kyiv early on Sunday, after officials warned of a possible ballistic missile attack. The alert, just before 4am, urged people to take cover immediately. Moments later, several loud blasts were heard, according to reports. Authorities said air defence units were engaging drones detected over the wider Kyiv region. Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said a woman and a child were injured in the attack.
-
Poland’s Operational Command said early on Sunday it had scrambled jets after detecting “long-range aviation of the Russian federation conducting strikes on the territory of Ukraine”.
-
The attacks on Kyiv followed explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv which killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people in what local authorities called an “act of terror”. The blasts in Lviv occurred just after police responded to a report of a break-in at a shop in the city centre, according to officials. A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later. “This is definitely an act of terror,” the Lviv mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said in a Facebook post.
-
Volodymyr Zelenskyy says “real opportunities to end war with dignity still exist”, calling for another round of talks, and hinting at a fresh leaders’ meeting. After he was debriefed on this week’s peace talks with Russia and the US in Geneva, Zelenskyy called for another round of talks to be held “very soon, as early as this February”. He said “Ukraine’s responses to the most difficult questions ahead of the next meeting are ready,” and that they still want to raise some issues at the leaders’ level with Trump and Putin. “It is the leaders’ format that could prove decisive in many respects, and Ukraine is ready for such a format,” he said.
-
Former British prime minister Boris Johnson says the UK and its European allies should immediately deploy noncombat troops to Ukraine to show the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that western nations are committed to the nation’s freedom and independence. Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Johnson told the BBC that the troops should be sent to peaceful regions in non-fighting roles.
-
A strike by Ukraine against a major missile factory deep inside Russia wounded 11 people, officials in Russia’s Udmurt Republics said. Ukraine’s General Staff confirmed it used Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” cruise missiles against the Votkinsk plant. Unofficial Russian Telegram channels also pointed to that site. Russia suspended flights at airports in and near the region. Ukraine also reported a strike on a gas plant in Samara, Russia.
-
About 2,000 people marched in Paris on Saturday, according to police, to show their support for Ukraine. European parliament member Raphael Glucksmann told Agence France-Presse there was “massive” support for Ukraine in France which “has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion”. “On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder,” he said.

Mark Bailey on his brushes with death, cabinet dumping, and plans to win back Queensland voters

Mark Bailey on his brushes with death, cabinet dumping, and plans to win back Queensland voters
Mark Bailey doesn’t think he’s been handed a poisoned chalice, despite being given a portfolio historically perceived as a burden reserved for political rivals.
Following the late 2023 resignation of former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who had loyally stuck by Bailey through periods of intense scrutiny, the former transport minister quit cabinet before almost certainly being dumped by incoming leader Steven Miles.
But less than 12 months later, he was back on the frontbench as the shadow health spokesman following Labor’s election loss.
“I took it on the chin,” Bailey said of his cabinet resignation, in a wide-ranging interview with this masthead in his electoral office in Yeerongpilly.
“That’s politics. Sometimes things happen.”
Bailey says his promotion to the health portfolio shows Miles “has a lot of faith in me” – and he’s adamant the role is an opportunity.
“[Health is] something that does touch everybody’s lives in so many ways.
“Sure, [it’s] one of the hardest portfolios … but that should be something to aspire to.
“It’s not something to complain about. It’s something to get results in.”
The LNP, meanwhile, have based their health sector “results” on Labor’s failures, as they pledge to reduce ambulance ramping rates, cut long elective surgery waitlists, and deliver infrastructure within budget.
With near-weekly regularity over the past year, Premier David Crisafulli and Health Minister Tim Nicholls have said these undertakings are needed to “heal Labor’s health crisis” and revive services after a “decade of decline”. And a large number of voters agree.
Polling in the lead-up to the 2024 state election showed healthcare and aged care ranked as one of the top issues influencing Queenslanders.
Despite a misstep on abortion that nearly saw Crisafulli’s campaign come unstuck, voters ultimately entrusted the LNP to manage the state’s health system for the next four years.
It leaves a long road ahead for the shadow health spokesman, who now has three years to convince Queensland that Labor can return to the driver’s seat in a portfolio that has traditionally been an area of strength. But Bailey is confident he’s got the gumption for it.
“We are going back to the grassroots, reconnecting with the community, and we intend to earn that trust by the next election,” he says.
Bailey’s office sits on the corner of King Arthur Terrace in Yeerongpilly’s Green Riverside Village, a short ride from his home on Brisbane’s southside, an area in which he’s lived since moving with his family from the Gold Coast at the age of six.
His parents divorced seven years after relocating, leaving his mum to raise the household as a single parent. “That was a bit more challenging, but my mum always provided,” he says.
Bailey’s interest in politics – “the contest of ideas” – was stirred during his time at Cavendish Road State High School. By his final year, he was meeting with a group of students in the library every day before school to “dissect The Courier-Mail and debate the issues of the day”.
“We realised we were progressive people, so we all joined the Labor Party the year after,” he says.
Two brushes with death during adolescence have lent extra weight to Bailey’s current political ambitions.
While riding to school along Logan Road, aged 15, he was struck by a car door and “catapulted” into oncoming traffic. In an ambulance to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, paramedics were only convinced that the teen had been run over after seeing black tyre marks on the back of his legs.
Two years later, Bailey spent more than a week in the Mater Hospital’s intensive care unit with salmonella food poisoning.
“The health system saved my life twice,” he says. “I’m not from a wealthy background, it was [because of] a strong public health system and fantastic staff and doctors.”
After high school, Bailey studied at the University of Queensland. Despite graduating with a teaching degree, he spent the next nine years as the deputy chair of Brisbane City Council’s planning committee.
He left council after almost a decade to spend time out of the “political bubble”, moving briefly to Byron Bay before relocating to New York City to pursue acting.
“I kind of felt it in my bones that I wanted to be in a major city,” Bailey says of his 2½-year sabbatical. “It was a great experience … I don’t regret a single day.”
But politics eventually lured him back to Australia. “In the world, there are a lot of actors [but] there aren’t enough activists … there are not enough people getting progressive change done. I thought that’s where I’m most needed.”
He returned to Queensland during the height of Campbell Newman’s reign as LNP premier. “We rapidly went back to the 1980s almost overnight in terms of the meanness [and] the disrespect for people,” Bailey says.
“That made me riled up … and then I decided I’d come back and run for state politics again.”
Bailey won the seat of Yeerongpilly and was given the roads, ports and energy portfolios after Labor ousted Newman in 2015.
Two years later, he replaced Jackie Trad as minister for transport and main roads.
He cites efforts under those portfolios – accelerating the Gold Coast’s light rail project and the Coomera Connector – as some of his proudest political achievements. But the years were not without controversy.
During his time as transport minister, Bailey faced criticism for cost blowouts on key projects, notably a $960 million excess on Brisbane’s Cross River Rail.
He was briefly stood aside from cabinet during a Crime and Corruption Commission investigation into his use of a personal email address in 2017, though was later cleared of corruption.
Last week, he was named in the ongoing CFMEU inquiry, accused of directing his department and its contractors to negotiate with the embattled union, and of running a “sham” consultation on the government’s Best Practice Industry Conditions policy.
When asked about the recent scrutiny, Bailey said it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment at this early stage. “I’m obviously watching, as many people are, the inquiry closely.”
Bailey was among the crowd on Tuesday when Nicholls delivered a keynote speech outlining the LNP’s Hospital Rescue Plan, drafted after a review of Labor’s Hospital Expansion Program found significant budget blowouts and delays.
Such critique, Bailey says, overlooks the challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The criticisms were politically convenient, but the reality was, the pandemic had huge impacts on construction costs, both public and private,” he says.
“We said the criticism was code for cuts and costs. What’s the first thing [the LNP] did? They did a review and cut a whole lot of the hospital expansion programs.”
If Bailey sees his current portfolio as a redemption arc for past misgivings, he’s not wasting time pitching his case to Queenslanders.
Returning serve on the LNP’s “decade of decline” claim, he’s been vocal about the Crisafulli government’s mishandling of last year’s flu season, its ban on pill testing and gender services for children, and its wage negotiations with public healthcare workers.
“You need a government where, from the top down, public health is the first priority that drives every single decision,” he says. “That’s not happening [in Queensland] right now.
“And you need a premier and health minister on the same page … and a health minister who will back best-practice medicine over ideology.
“In opposition, there are a range of things you can achieve through pressure and advocacy … and [the LNP] will get maximum pressure from me.”

China’s vocational degrees rising as students seek skills over prestigious universities
Job-placement rates for vocational undergraduate colleges now outpace traditional universities, as youth unemployment drives pivot to more reliable employment path
When the results of China’s gruelling National Higher Education Entrance Examination – or gaokao – were released last summer, Lin Gangming was surprised to learn that he had scored high enough to attend some of the country’s top universities.
But instead of chasing prestige, the student from Yangjiang, a small coastal city in Guangdong province, chose a different path: Shenzhen Polytechnic University – a public undergraduate vocational college in the province.
Stories like Lin’s, covered by the Shenzhen Special Zone Daily and other publications last year, have become increasingly common in domestic media. Lin was quoted while speaking at a symposium in July for the university’s incoming freshmen.
Amid an oversupply of traditional college graduates, China’s undergraduate vocational track – once seen as a backup plan for underperforming exam-takers – is now a strategic choice for some.
While these institutions grant bachelor’s degrees, their curriculum is geared towards equipping students with technical skills – a major draw for students seeking a more reliable pathway to employment.
“China is making an effort to integrate rather than segregate the academic and vocational-technical components of higher learning,” said Gerard Postiglione, a professor specialising in education in China at the University of Hong Kong. He noted that the recalibration follows economic diversification and accelerating technological development.

Up close and personal: Brisbane clubs commit to getting Gen Z offline
The 20-somethings and late teens of Generation Z often get a bad rap for being addicted to their phones. But these groups are proving young people want to get off the apps to connect face to face.
When Magnus Murray-Douglass felt social media had let him and fellow members of Generation Z down, he turned to something else he thought could bring people together: Brisbane’s rubbish.
Technology has been claimed to connect people, but Murray-Douglass believes it actually drives young people further apart.
He isn’t alone in feeling that way.
About 91 per cent of Gen Zers polled for the Foundation for Social Health in 2025 believed social media adversely affected the strength of their real-life interactions.
The same poll found more than half said their social media usage left them feeling distressed and distracted, and seriously impacted their mental health.
That was one big reason that Murray-Douglass founded Rubbish Club.
“Dating apps claim to have solved that problem [of connection]. Social media claims to bring us closer together,” he says. “But we feel like Rubbish Club is the place that actually brings people closer together.”
His social club is just one of many popping up throughout Brisbane, getting Generation Zers offline and bringing them together.
Here are the stories of a few more.
Three sisters open to a new chapter
Sisters Tayler, Miller and Sienna Kerta are behind the popular BNE Chapters book club.
With monthly events attracting up to 180 attendees and an online community of more than 6000 people on Instagram, the club has become an institution for Brisbane ladies who love reading.
Or as Miller puts it, “every BNE Chapters event is simply chaotic but fun, inviting and relaxing”.
“When we kicked off BNE Chapters, there weren’t many places or social clubs in Brisbane for people to make new friends,” she says.
“The turnout and engagement we receive each month just shows the strong demand for communities and spaces such as BNE Chapters.
“We have absolutely loved watching girls connect at our events.”
The sisters have also started social community We Are WMN, a nod to their Balinese heritage standing for Wayan, Made and Nyoman, which translates to first, second and third born.
The community has hosted bathhouse, Pilates, breath work, trivia and formal ball events.
“We are always trying to include other small businesses and venues in Brisbane, so love to curate events to work alongside these opportunities when they arise,” Miller says.
Tickets are $35 and include a drink on arrival.
Bonding over trash talk
Murray-Douglass, the founder of Rubbish Club, remembers growing up in a school environment where collecting rubbish was punishment for doing something wrong.
He’s hoping to change that script with his Saturday morning meet-ups, which start with a coffee and offer a chance to meet new people while cleaning up Brisbane suburbs in a casual and low-commitment way.
“If we live in such a beautiful landscape and have amazing waterways, why wouldn’t you want to keep those looking amazing?” he says.
“If you can be yapping to your friends while doing it, why wouldn’t you?”
Each week the club wanders around a different suburb and collects rubbish, with plastics being recycled at Murray-Douglass’ company Boe Design – a recyclables company that manufactures furniture.
Attendance is free and members often get a discount at the coffee shop where they meet beforehand.
It’s on the cards
As more young people experience disenchantment with dating apps, 22-year-old Sarah Ellis was inspired to create a card game that connects singles in real life.
“Most single people I speak to are experiencing serious dating app fatigue,” Ellis says.
“The constant pressure to curate the perfect profile, keep conversations interesting and compete for attention has made dating feel more like a chore than something exciting.”
Her game, WE MET AT A BAR, aims to reignite the dating process – the initial spark, the body language – to create opportunities for spontaneous interactions.
It is designed to be played in a bar with prompts such as: “go and compliment a stranger” and “compliment someone’s smile, then walk away”.
Beyond the bar, WE MET AT A BAR has resulted in lasting connections.
“People regularly DM us with stories and photos of the people they’ve met through the game, which is incredibly rewarding to see,” Ellis says.
The game can be bought online for $49.99.
Drop the phone, raise a glass
Another Brisbane-based club aiming to foster face-to-face relationships and allow Generation Zers to explore the city is Social Sips, created by Sasha Kratzmann and Emma Fitzgerald.
The club was inspired by Kratzmann’s time studying abroad in Dublin.
“When I came back to Brisbane, I noticed we were all going to the same familiar spots, and it made me realise that we tend to explore so much when we travel, but rarely do the same in our own city,” she says.
This sparked the creation of the low-commitment social club.
Each month attendees meet at a Brisbane bar with the goal of getting outside their comfort zones and off their phones.
“We’ve had people tell us they’ve met lifelong friends, found housemates, and even met their partners through Social Sips,” Kratzmann says.
She says Gen Z’s shift away from being online is playing a big role in the success of the club.
“I think that’s why we’re seeing more social clubs pop up – people are craving real-life interaction without a screen involved,” Kratzmann says.
Social Sips events are $25 and include a drink on arrival and nibbles.

Deadly explosions rock Ukraine's Lviv city

Explosions in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv have killed a policewoman and wounded at least 15 people overnight in what local authorities on Sunday called an "act of terror".
The blasts occurred shortly after police responded to a report of a break‑in at a shop in the city centre around 2230 GMT Saturday, according to the Lviv regional prosecutor's office.
A first explosion struck as the initial patrol arrived, followed by a second blast moments later when another crew reached the scene.
Officials said a 23‑year‑old woman police officer was killed, while a patrol car and a civilian vehicle were damaged.
"This is definitely an act of terror," Lviv mayor Andriy Sadovy said in a Facebook post. "We have 15 people currently receiving medical aid; some of them are in very serious condition.
"One policewoman died. My condolences to the family and close ones," he added.
Lviv, close to the Polish border and far from the front line, has faced sporadic strikes and security incidents since the Russia-Ukraine war started in February 2022, but deadly explosions in the city centre remain rare.

Arab and Islamic countries jointly condemned remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel had a biblical right to a vast swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of Tucker Carlson.
In an episode released on Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the Nile River in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.
In response, Huckabee said: “It would be fine if they took it all.”
When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was “not asking to take all of that”, adding: “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments – alongside three major regional organisations – issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat’s comments as “dangerous and inflammatory”.
The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates’ foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
They said the comments contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.
Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.
Saudi Arabia described the ambassador’s words as “reckless” and “irresponsible”, while Jordan said it was “an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region”.
Kuwait decried what it called a “flagrant violation of the principles of international law”, while Oman said the comments “threatened the prospects for peace” and stability in the region.
Egypt’s foreign ministry reaffirmed “that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands”.
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee’s words “contradict US President Donald Trump’s rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank”.
On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.
The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of “falsehoods and manipulations”.

Ukraine calls on European partners to boost anti-ballistic missile production
According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
Participants in the meeting discussed priorities for strengthening missile defense.
The conference was attended by Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, French Minister of the Armed Forces Catherine Vautrin, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas, and NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska.
Fedorov emphasized that Europe’s defense industry must urgently increase production capacity for ballistic missile defense systems, as current output levels remain critically low.
He proposed launching joint projects with European countries to develop and manufacture anti-ballistic solutions, adding that Ukraine is already implementing its own initiatives in this area.
Fedorov also stressed the need to continue funding the PURL program, which he described as a key mechanism for obtaining PAC-3 interceptor missiles for Patriot air defense systems.
He thanked partners for the concrete decisions taken during the Ramstein-format meeting.
Separately, Fedorov expressed gratitude to Pistorius for initiating additional deliveries of PAC-3 missiles, noting that Ukraine has already begun receiving them under these agreements.
“Implementation of agreements within hours is an example of how we should work,” Fedorov stressed.
In addition, he said Ukraine is preparing proposals to increase economic pressure on Russia, including asymmetric measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet.
According to Fedorov, Ukraine is counting on European leadership to implement these measures.
The minister also emphasized the importance of fast and flexible use of the EU defense credit for Ukraine, noting that the funds must serve the primary goal – bringing the war to a successful conclusion for Ukraine.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the goal of E5-format defense ministers’ meetings is to reaffirm Europe’s unity and shared responsibility for security in the Euro-Atlantic area.

Israel prepared for imminent US strike on Iran, but now it’s on hold

10:35:17 KST

After a postponement Thursday, the Security Cabinet is set to convene Sunday to discuss preparations for a possible U.S. strike on Iran, addressing both defensive readiness and potential offensive coordination.
Israeli officials are operating under the assumption that Israel would assist the United States in the event of an attack, with responsibilities divided between the two countries.
Israel had prepared for possible action over the weekend, but by Thursday it became clear that any strike had been delayed to an unspecified — though likely near-term — date.
While a diplomatic arrangement between Washington and Tehran remains on the table, officials say the prospects for military escalation currently appear higher.
Deep gaps in the sides’ fundamental positions have complicated efforts to bridge differences. Some officials in Washington view Iran’s leadership as weakened and under economic and political pressure, potentially vulnerable to substantial concessions. Iranian leaders, however, appear reluctant to risk being seen domestically as yielding to U.S. demands, even at the cost of military confrontation.
Ultimately, whether any Iranian compromise proposal is deemed sufficient to avert conflict may rest largely with President Donald Trump. If he concludes that proposed concessions fall short, options ranging from a limited agreement to a broad military strike remain under consideration.
Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst
Should a military confrontation ultimately materialize, Iran’s capacity to inflict significant damage on Israel, U.S. forces in the Middle East and Gulf states should not be underestimated. Iran’s arsenal of ballistic missiles, drones and allied proxy forces could enable Tehran to mount a painful response.
Meanwhile, public discourse in recent years has at times overstated the strength of Iran and allied terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, while downplaying Israeli and U.S. offensive and defensive capabilities.
A confrontation, if it occurs, would not necessarily develop into a prolonged war of attrition without clear outcome. Israel and the United States maintain significant advantages in airpower, intelligence and technology, which could allow for relatively short and focused operations targeting missile and nuclear infrastructure, even if such strikes do not immediately bring about regime change.
The U.S. decision-making process has also drawn scrutiny. It began with public expressions of support for protesters in Iran, continued with sustained negotiations and was accompanied by simultaneous military threats and operational preparations. In previous years, Iran’s missile and nuclear programs were not broadly treated by Washington as sufficient grounds for an all-out war.
From Israel’s perspective, officials see the current moment as a potential opportunity. Jerusalem's concerns extend beyond Iran’s nuclear program to the expansion of its precision-guided missile capabilities. Close coordination with the United States could enable strikes on production, storage and launch infrastructure, and potentially undermine regime stability by targeting centers of power and mechanisms of repression.
A strategic shift — and the possibility of targeting Khamenei
The clearest sign of a strategic shift is the move away from plans for a “short, decisive strike” toward a more prolonged campaign aimed at sustained pressure, military analyst Ron Ben-Yishai wrote Saturday.
The expected arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier to the region, capable of launching up to roughly 150 combat sorties per day, underscores the depth of the buildup. Significant additional naval and air forces are also expected to operate alongside it.
Unlike a limited strike, a campaign of attrition would aim at the systematic degradation of regime assets: nuclear facilities, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps bases, missile arrays and command centers. According to this approach, only sustained military pressure — rather than a one-time strike — could compel Iran’s leadership to consider far-reaching concessions, or at least sharply reduce its strategic capabilities.
At the same time, a broad military operation would not guarantee the collapse of Iran’s government. History shows that ideological regimes can survive severe blows. Still, sustained targeting of senior leadership, security apparatuses and key repression mechanisms could undermine stability and weaken the regime’s hold on the public. Some assessments do not rule out the possibility of targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or his son, who is widely viewed as a potential successor.
Iranian society has been experiencing an unprecedented level of unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. A combination of heavy external pressure and growing internal instability could create a new dynamic, though its outcome would be unpredictable.
Iranian concerns were reflected in remarks broadcast Saturday on Al Mayadeen, a network aligned with the pro-Iran axis. A source described as close to decision-making circles was quoted as saying: “Any war against Iran would mark the beginning of an inevitable unraveling of the global order. It would open the door for other powers to exploit the change to implement their geopolitical agendas. Such a war would alter the calculations of China and Russia. Fundamental shifts could push China and Russia to impose new geographic realities that serve their interests. Any military confrontation with Iran would not remain confined to its borders but would affect the entire international balance.”
Timing of a potential strike
The timing of any action would depend on military readiness as well as political and regional considerations, including religious sensitivities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, concerns about potential disruption to shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and pressure from regional governments.
There is also the risk of unintended escalation, including a possible Iranian preemptive move or a miscalculation that could ignite hostilities.
President Trump may prefer to wait until mid-March, after the end of Ramadan. At the same time, he has publicly referenced a timeframe of 10 to 15 days, raising the possibility that action could come sooner.
The arrival of the USS Gerald R. Ford in the eastern Mediterranean toward the end of the coming week also factors into the decision. Its deployment effectively signals the completion of the U.S. force buildup, aside from the possible dispatch of B-2 strategic bombers, which the United States could send directly toward Iran in an effort to surprise its leadership.
Seizing a historic opportunity
Israeli officials are preparing for the possibility that a U.S.-Iran confrontation could provide an opportunity to significantly weaken Tehran’s missile capabilities and those of its regional allies.
Potential targets include ballistic missile stockpiles and production facilities, as well as missile infrastructure linked to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Senior Israeli officials have spoken of removing what they describe as long-term strategic threats to Israel.
Ultimately, options remain under consideration: a limited agreement allowing each side to claim an achievement, a restrained strike or a broad and sustained campaign. The decision will be made in Washington, but its consequences will be felt in Jerusalem, Tehran and capitals across the region.

Pakistan says militant hideouts struck along Afghan border

Pakistan says militant hideouts struck along Afghan border
February 22, 2026Pakistan said Sunday it had carried out strikes against multiple militant hideouts along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.
Islamabad did not say precisely which areas it targeted or provide additional details.
The Taliban authorities in Kabul said the Pakistani strikes had killed and wounded "dozens of people."
"Last night, they bombed our civilian compatriots in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, martyring and wounding dozens of people, including women and children," local media quoted Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid as saying.
What did Pakistan say about the strikes?
Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts," a statement by the country's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
It noted that the camps belonged to the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
Pakistan said the strikes were carried out in response to recent security incidents in the country, including asuicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other more recent suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan.
The mosque bombing killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 160.
It was the deadliest attack in Pakistan's capital since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.
An affiliate of the so-called "Islamic State" group had claimed responsibility for the bombing.
After the latest suicide bombings, Pakistan's military warned that it would not "exercise any restraint” and that operations against those responsible would continue "irrespective of their location."
What's behind tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan?
Pakistan has seen a surge in militant violence in recent years.
Islamabad blames Afghan-based elements for the attacks and has accused the Taliban of allowing Afghan soil to be used to harbor militants.
Pakistan wants Kabul to clamp down on the TTP, which is a separate group but closely linked to the Afghan Taliban.
The TTP seeks to impose a hard-line interpretation of Islam, particularly on Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan.
According to Pakistan's government, the group operates from Afghan soil with impunity.
The Afghan Taliban deny the allegations and say they cannot be held accountable for security incidents inside Pakistan.
Fierce fighting erupted between the Pakistani military and Afghan Taliban forces last October, marking the deadliest conflict between the neighbors since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants.
Relations between the neighboring countries have remained tense ever since.

Four Years On, Ukraine Supporters Rally in Washington, Call for ‘Rock-Solid’ Western Unity

WASHINGTON -- Four years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of its neighbor, hundreds of Ukraine's supporters gathered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, transforming the heart of the US capital into a sea of blue and yellow.
What began in 2022 as a spontaneous outpouring of shock and solidarity has evolved into what participants on February 21 described as a "heartbreaking tradition."
For the fourth consecutive year, Ukrainians and their supporters assembled in the US capital to mark the anniversary of the war with prayer, song, and defiant chants before marching toward the Russian ambassador's residence.
Organizers said the aim was to demonstrate a united front in Washington and to urge continued US engagement in efforts to end the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II.
For many Ukrainians in attendance, the rally was more than a symbolic gesture; it was a painful reminder of the destruction still unfolding at home.
One woman, who relocated her family to the United States during the war, said it remains vital to remind the American public of the daily hardships and existential threats Ukrainians endure.
The message repeated throughout the afternoon was clear: The war is about more than territory -- it is about survival.
'A Heartbreaking Tradition'
The rally was organized by leading Ukrainian-American organizations in cooperation with the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington.
Maryna Baydyuk, president of United Help Ukraine, which has held annual events to mark the invasion's anniversary, argued that Ukraine must be viewed not as a supplicant but as a strategic partner.
"We need the support of Americans, but we also need the support of the US government and the current administration," she told RFE/RL.
"We should see Ukraine not just as a country at war, a beggar. We should see Ukraine as an ally…standing in front of a massive Russian army, holding the line -- not just for Ukraine, but for the rest of Europe and for the rest of the free world."
Nova Ukraine, one of the largest US charities providing humanitarian aid to the country, also participated.
Its chief executive officer, Ambassador Erin McKee, told RFE/RL that its goal was to highlight urgent winter needs on the ground -- ranging from basic humanitarian assistance to amplifying the voices of children, teachers, and doctors living through the conflict every day.
Since 2014, the organization says, it has disbursed approximately $150 million in assistance.
European Support on Display
European diplomats joined the rally, underlining what speakers described as essential transatlantic unity.
Jovita Neliupsiene, the EU's ambassador to Washington, echoed the sentiment that the annual gathering has become a "heartbreaking tradition."
"Sometimes we forget that this war is really happening," she told RFE/RL, warning that Moscow continues to "weaponize the winter."
She urged a sustained effort to "push back" and ensure international voices remain united in support of Kyiv.
Asked about the state of Western unity, Neliupsiene noted that while no one wants the war to persist, the challenge lies in achieving a "sustainable, long-lasting, and fair peace."
"If we continue to support Ukraine, if we continue to put massive pressure on Russia via sanctions and other economic measures…and if the aggressor knows that aggression cannot just go away without accountability for war crimes, that would be the right message and the show of unity," she said.
Her message to Russian President Vladimir Putin was direct: "This war can actually stop right now if Russia stops the aggression."
Calls for Peace -- And Accountability
Among the speakers was Pastor Mark Burns, a prominent spiritual adviser to President Donald Trump. Addressing the crowd, Burns questioned how Russia's leadership could justify attacks on civilians and houses of worship while claiming to uphold Christian values.
"How can you be a Christian when you bomb little children who are just walking to church to worship the name of the Lord Jesus?" Burns asked.
"How can you be a Christian when you allow Russian soldiers to rape women? How can you be a Christian when you bomb more than 700 churches in Ukraine?.… That's not the kind of Christianity that I believe in."
Speaking to RFE/RL, Burns said he had visited Ukraine and shared his firsthand accounts of the atrocities he witnessed -- including in Bucha -- with Trump.
"The last conversation I had with the [US] president was a couple of days ago, and he said to me, 'We are very, very close to having a cease-fire,'" Burns said.
He rejected suggestions that Trump favors Moscow, calling such claims false, and asserted that the president is working toward a resolution.
"President Trump wants peace," Burns said. "He knows you cannot trust Russia."
Denys Sienik, deputy chief of mission at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, said Kyiv seeks a "credible, lasting, and just” peace backed by clear security guarantees.
“That’s all Ukrainians want,” he told RFE/RL, while accusing Russia of continuing to wage a campaign of terror against civilians.
Sienik stated that Ukraine remains committed to negotiations and expressed gratitude to the Trump administration and other partners involved in peace efforts. However, he stressed the necessity of strengthening Ukraine’s defenses to save lives while talks proceed.
‘Washington Should Not Look Away’
Some demonstrators expressed fears that American attention is waning as the war enters its fifth year. Others argued that Ukraine’s fate has implications reaching far beyond its borders.
Sienik pointed to the size and diversity of the crowd as evidence of enduring support in the United States. "I'm really proud to see not only Ukrainians, but Americans, with us today, as well as Europeans and nationals from other countries," he said. "Every word matters."
As the sun set over the National Mall, thousands began their march from the Lincoln Memorial toward the Russian ambassador’s residence -- a visible show of unity tinged with grief.
Four years ago, few in this crowd imagined they would be standing there again, pleading for the world's attention.

Investment gold retailers move into vacant Hong Kong high-street shops on metal’s rise

Investment gold retailers move into vacant Hong Kong high-street shops on metal’s rise
‘We see overwhelming demand for investment gold coins and bars,’ retailer San Gold Coins’ Sophia Chen says
These retailers – which sell gold coins and bars, rather than ornamental pieces – have taken up ground-floor store spaces that were left vacant during the city’s post-pandemic recovery.
Their rapid expansion has been followed by the return of high-end jewellery vendors, a development that has helped stabilise rents in some of the city’s most expensive districts.
San Gold Coins, a mainland Chinese bullion retailer with about 100 stores across its home market, has expanded quickly in Hong Kong over the past 18 months. It opened three street-level stores in Central, Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui, and planned to add up to three more shops this year.
“We see overwhelming demand for investment gold coins and bars, that’s why we decided to ramp up [store expansion],” said Sophia Chen, the retailer’s sixth-generation heir and general manager overseeing overseas business.
While jewellery merchants are common in both Hong Kong and mainland China, investment gold retailers like San Gold Coins remained relatively rare, she said.

Opinion | Executive-led governance in Hong Kong must start by listening to the people
As the head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office has stressed, an executive-led system must be coherent to be effective, and this requires building consensus
Under the Basic Law, the chief executive is the head of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the head of the SAR government. Standing at the apex of the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, the chief executive bears dual accountability – accountable to both the central people’s government and to Hong Kong.
This dual responsibility is central to the governance philosophy. A sound structure does not automatically produce good governance; the governance philosophy of engaging the governed is vital.
If the chief executive is the head of the system, the civil service is its backbone and operational limbs. Hong Kong’s civil servants have long been admired for their efficiency and competence. They are one of Hong Kong’s most valuable governance assets.
Yet given Hong Kong society’s sophistication and rising expectations, administrative competence alone is insufficient. A system may still falter if it does not embed effective channels for aggregating public opinion and building consent in policy formulation and implementation.

The bodies of nine backcountry skiers killed earlier this week were recovered Saturday after an avalanche struck the California side of Lake Tahoe, according to officials.
Authorities said the group was on a day-trip skiing expedition on Tuesday when the avalanche struck.
Six of those killed were close friends described as “passionate, skilled skiers", along with three professional guides.
Relatives identified the victims as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt.
The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that three employees from the Blackbird Mountain Guides, Michael Henry, 30, Andrew Alissandratos, 34, and Nicole Choo, 42, also died in the avalanche.
“We are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Shannan Moon, the sheriff of Nevada County, California, as reported by NBC News.
Five of the victims were recovered and airlifted on Friday by helicopter.
Fifteen skiers were caught in the avalanche. Six survived, including two who sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
Multiple agencies have launched investigations into the avalanche.
The Sierra Avalanche Centre will prepare an incident report and is examining possible workplace safety violations, and the sheriff’s office is conducting its own inquiry.
The storm has dumped 1.7 metres of snow in the past week alone, with wind gusts reaching 90 kilometres per hour.
The Colorado Avalanche Information Centre noted that this season has already seen six other avalanche fatalities in the US.

Ex-PM Gordon Brown tells police to investigate Andrew’s use of jets and bases
Former British prime minister Gordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The Telegraph can reveal that Brown wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Mountbatten-Windsor’s time as a trade envoy. The royal was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No. 10.
He has also demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links Mountbatten-Windsor’s government work to Epstein.
His five-page letters were sent individually to police in London, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley, Norfolk and Bedfordshire this week, but their contents were not publicly disclosed. Brown said only that they contained “new and additional information”.
The Telegraph can now reveal that they show his deep concern that Mountbatten-Windsor had used chartered RAF flights to transport him to personal engagements that could have involved Epstein, and that the former prince might have leaked confidential information from the trips in a “wholly unacceptable” use of public money.
At the time, Mountbatten-Windsor was nicknamed “Airmiles Andy” for using taxpayer-funded flights to make private leisure or business trips, usually on the way back from a government engagement.
Brown believes that given the close relationship between the two men, the planes may have been used to facilitate meetings with Epstein.
Mountbatten-Windsor has been accused of sexually abusing Virginia Giuffre, who was then 17, after she was introduced to him by Epstein – a claim the former prince has always denied.
Brown wants police to interview officials at four government departments – the Ministry of Defence, the Department for Transport, the Foreign Office and the Treasury – over Mountbatten-Windsor’s trade envoy role, in an attempt to uncover any link to the disgraced financier.
The former prime minister is also understood to be concerned about a flight the convicted paedophile took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at RAF Marham air base in Norfolk in December 2000, which The Telegraph revealed more than a decade ago.
Emails and flight logs that the US Justice Department have disclosed show that the jet, carrying Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, initially landed at Luton Airport on December 6. The following day, it made the 129-kilometre hop to RAF Marham, this time with two additional passengers, one of whom is listed only as an unnamed “female”.
It reported that after landing at a Ministry of Defence base, Epstein and Maxwell travelled the 32-kilometre journey to the Queen’s Sandringham Estate, where they were entertained by Mountbatten-Windsor, who is alleged to have arranged their access to the base.
The public only learned of Mountbatten-Windsor’s alleged role in facilitating the use of the military airbase after the release of the Epstein files.
Emails show Maxwell raising queries from a Telegraph reporter with Epstein, telling him: “I think that’s crap and not true and you should say so”. He replied: “Just spoke to Larry [Visoski, his pilot], it’s true”.
“S--t..,” Maxwell responded.
In light of the apparent use of British military facilities, Brown has requested that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.
His letter to police makes reference to a photograph of the former prince lying on the laps of unnamed guests at Sandringham, flanked by Maxwell, Epstein’s “lieutenant”.
The Epstein files revealed how deeply enmeshed the House of York had become with the convicted paedophile. Emails show Epstein and his associates sought to exploit the former prince’s “aura and access” as UK trade envoy, while also dazzling him with offers of female company and lucrative business deals.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday night (AEDT) on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, after the release of emails that are alleged to have shown he passed sensitive information to Epstein while working for the government.
Brown believes that Mountbatten-Windsor’s use of hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money to fly to the trade envoy meetings may exacerbate the seriousness of his conduct.
In this week’s letters, he gave an extensive list of runways used by Epstein in the UK, including those at commercial airports in Edinburgh, Belfast, Liverpool, Birmingham, Norfolk, Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted.
He believes airline employees and staff at the nine airports should be questioned about Epstein’s flights to the UK, after his own analysis of the Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice uncovered emails between Epstein’s pilots and other members of staff discussing flights.
He has called for any records held by the UK Ministry of Defence to be handed to the police, and for a thorough investigation establishing what diligence checks were carried out on Epstein before he was cleared to land.
Brown has said publicly that he is concerned about the complicity of the British state in Epstein’s offences, arguing that Britain’s “unacknowledged role” in the Epstein saga “is by far the biggest scandal of all”.
Mountbatten-Windsor is under investigation for misconduct in public office. The King stripped him of his titles last year, and he now also faces losing his position in the line of succession, following an unprecedented intervention from Downing Street on Friday.
On Saturday, police continued to search Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home, Royal Lodge.
Two of his private bodyguards were photographed stocking up on supplies in King’s Lynn, close to his new Sandringham home, carrying boxes of beer under their arms.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it was “standard practice” for private or commercial aircraft to use RAF airfields, “subject to fees which cover all costs”.
The spokesman added: “Such use is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield.”
Mountbatten-Windsor was approached for comment.

Pakistan strikes seven militant camps in Afghan border region
Islamabad said Sunday it had carried out strikes on seven sites along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region targeting Afghan-based militant groups it blames for recent suicide attacks.
Citing three attacks since the start of Ramadan last week, Pakistan "has carried out intelligence-based selective targeting of seven Terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban" and its affiliates in the border region, a statement by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said.
The statement posted on X by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had also targeted an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
It did not indicate where the strikes were carried out or give further details on them.
The ministry said they were carried out in response to a suicide blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other more recent suicide bombings in northwest Pakistan.
The Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing which killed at least 31 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack on Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.
Pakistan has accused Afghanistan's Taliban authorities of allowing Afghan soil to be used to harbour militants and the relationship between the two countries has deteriorated sharply with deadly border clashes in recent months.

STOCKHOLM, February 22. /TASS/. A dialogue between Russia and Finland is still possible, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview with Finland’s television and radio broadcaster Yle.
"Well, definitely, at some point... However, we need to come to terms regarding what we want to achieve via this dialogue and determine the responsibilities," Valtonen said in response to a question whether a dialogue with Moscow is still possible in the future.
The Finnish top diplomat said she believed that Europe should play a more significant role in the peace process.
Valtonen also noted that Finland was considering at the moment the possibility of involving former President Sauli Niinisto in negotiations with Russia.
"We have experienced negotiators, and Niinisto is certainly one of them. However, it's not relevant at the moment," she stated.
The Finnish foreign minister also pointed out that it was important to launch a European Union aid package for Ukraine worth 90 billion euros ($106.03 billion), which was previously blocked by Hungary.
According to her, Finland has already helped Ukraine having allocated from its reserves "everything possible, including defense materials and assistance to overcome the energy crisis."
Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo stated in late January that he was ready to sit down at the negotiating table with Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, according to him, the time for such talks has not yet come.
Earlier, Politico reported, citing sources, that European Union countries are discussing the possibility of appointing a special envoy for negotiations on a Ukrainian settlement, who would engage in dialogue with the Russian side on behalf of the bloc. Finnish President Alexander Stubb has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the role.

Afghanistan promises ‘appropriate response’ after deadly Pakistani strikes
At least 17 killed and six missing as Pakistan attacks a school and homes in an operation against the Pakistan Taliban’s camps and hideouts.
Pakistan’s military early on Sunday carried out air raids in Afghanistan, targeting what it called “camps and hideouts” belonging to armed groups behind a spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad.
Pakistan’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in a statement on X on Sunday that the country’s military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps and hideouts belonging to the Pakistan Taliban, also known by the acronym TTP, and its affiliates.

The ISIL (ISIS) affiliate in Khorasan Province, or ISKP, which claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in the capital earlier this month, was also targeted in the operation, the ministry said.
The Pakistani ministry said it had “conclusive evidence” that recent attacks in Islamabad, as well as in the northwestern Bajaur and Bannu districts, were perpetrated by fighters at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
The Afghan Ministry of Defence condemned the attacks that “hit a religious school and residential homes” in the border provinces of Nangarhar and Paktika, “resulting in dozens of deaths and injuries, including women and children”.
The Defence Ministry condemned the attacks as “a breach of international law and the principles of good neighbourliness”, and promised to respond.
“We hold the Pakistani military responsible for targeting civilians and religious sites. We will respond to these attacks in due course with a measured and appropriate response,” it said.
Reporting from the scene of an attack in Nangarhar’s Bihsud district, Al Jazeera’s Naser Shadid said at least 17 people were confirmed killed and six others are missing, feared trapped under the rubble of an attacked house.
“A religious centre was also hit in this area, according to Afghanistan’s authorities, and there are an unknown number of casualties there as well,” he said.
There was no information on any casualties in Paktika yet.
The attacks threaten a fragile ceasefire between the South Asian neighbours, negotiated following deadly border clashes that killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected fighters in October last year.
Pakistan said it has repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban government to take action to prevent armed groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks, but that Kabul has failed to “undertake any substantive action”.
Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, it added, but said the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained its top priority.
“The Pakistanis continue to insist that these are intelligence-based operations against camps located inside Afghanistan and hideouts of the TTP and its affiliate groups. It has warned the Afghan authorities on several occasions that they gave their commitment in the Doha agreement that Afghan soil will not be used by any other country,” Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder said, referring to the 2020 agreement the Taliban signed with the United States in the Qatari capital.
The Pakistani air raids on Afghanistan came hours after a suicide bomber attacked a security convoy in the Bannu district of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing two soldiers, one of them a lieutenant colonel.
On Monday, a suicide bomber, backed by armed men, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in the nearby Bajaur, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
On February 6, another suicide bomber detonated his explosives during noon prayers at the Khadija Tul Kubra mosque in Islamabad’s Tarlai Kalan area, killing at least 31 worshippers and wounding 170 others.
The ISKP had claimed responsibility for the Islamabad attack.
While bombings are rare in the heavily guarded capital, it was the second such attack on Khadija Tul Kubra in three months, raising fears of a return to violence in Pakistan’s major urban centres.
At the time, the Pakistani military said the “planning, training, and indoctrination for the attack took place in Afghanistan”.
In its statement on Sunday, the Pakistani Information Ministry reiterated its call for the international community to press the Taliban to uphold its commitments under the Doha deal. The ministry said the move was “vital for regional and global peace and security”.
Pakistan has seen a surge in violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from Afghanistan, a charge the group denies.
The Taliban government has also consistently denied sheltering anti-Pakistan armed groups.
Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense following the deadly clashes in October. The fighting followed explosions in Kabul, which Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A ceasefire mediated by Qatar on October 19 has largely held, but subsequent talks in Turkiye’s Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement.

Karyna Shuliak was Jeffrey Epstein's last partner and main heiress. She won't benefit from his will

A loyal companion of sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, Karyna Shuliak was the last person to speak to him on the phone shortly before his suicide in prison on August 10, 2019. Close to the disgraced financier, to whom she was simultaneously a lover, manager and dependent, she appears as his main beneficiary in the will he wrote in his cell before his death.
According to that document, Shuliak was supposed to inherit $100 million (€85 million) and the criminal's properties: his Manhattan townhouse, his apartment on Avenue Foch in Paris, his private islands, his ranch in New Mexico, as well as a 32-carat ring purchased for $1.2 million. Despite this lavish inheritance, the 36-year-old, who currently lives in New York, will not see a penny, as American and French authorities have decided to freeze the estate to allocate it to a victims' compensation fund.
It all began in 2009. Shuliak, then a 20-year-old student of dental medicine at Minsk University, started corresponding with the billionaire, who was 36 years older than her. Known for his preference for women from Eastern Europe, Epstein invited her – all expenses paid – to the United States, promising help with her studies and support for her visa application. Arriving in New York in August of that year, the young woman became part of the financier's life, just after he had served his first prison sentence for procuring minors for prostitution. He liked her, and he kept his promises.

Hong Kong budget 2026-27: what’s holding back the city’s tech and talent schemes?
Finance chief’s blueprint seen as gauge for officials’ ‘reform mindset’ following Beijing’s 15th five-year plan recommendations
Hong Kong’s coming annual budget must address critical bottlenecks in technology and talent attraction to pave the way for the city’s first five-year development framework in line with national priorities, according to observers.
Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions, the plan – expected to be officially endorsed next month – prioritises technological self-reliance, “new quality productive forces” and expanding domestic consumption, with “comprehensive reform” as a guiding principle.
The framework outlines Beijing’s support for transforming Hong Kong into an international innovation and technology centre and a global destination for top talent, while consolidating the city’s role as an international financial, aviation and trade hub.
While Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu recently said he had instructed all policy bureaus to work “in full force” to devise a “Hong Kong five-year plan” within this year, Chan hinted the budget would include measures to help mainland Chinese innovation and technology enterprises “go global” and promote the clustering of key businesses in the city.
Observers said the government should address critical bottlenecks in Hong Kong’s own tech ecosystem first, as its slowdown did not just affect the city’s competitive edge but extended more broadly to the Greater Bay Area, which covers Macau and nine mainland cities.

No advice from ASIO to block passports of women with alleged IS links, Burke says

Australian officials don't want women and children allegedly linked to the self-proclaimed Islamic State (IS) group to return to the country, but the threshold hasn't been reached to bar them from receiving passports.
Some 34 women and children tied to Australians who travelled to the Middle East to fight for the terrorist group have been trying for days to travel home from a Syrian refugee camp.
The cohort has been issued with Australian passports, a right afforded to citizens, but one of the women has been given a temporary exclusion order, barring their re-entry for up to two years.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said security agencies had not passed on any advice that would block the group from receiving the required travel documents to return to Australia.
"There's been no advice from ASIO that the Passports Act provisions have been activated," he told ABC's Insiders program on Sunday.
"On the information that we have, the best way to protect Australians has not involved any further temporary exclusion orders.
"We don't want them to come back ... we're actively making sure we do nothing to help them."
The 34-strong cohort was not a coherent group, Burke added, but enough information was available to issue the single exclusion order.
"We know the different individuals, we know the state of mind and effective ideology of different individuals," he said. "Our agencies have been following them for a long time."
The minister noted a majority of the cohort were born in Australia and he confirmed state and federal agencies had been working together to mitigate any potential risks from their return.
Burke also rejected claims made in a report in the Sunday Telegraph asserting that official preparations were underway for the cohort’s return.
"In that report, it makes a claim that we are conducting a repatriation. We are not," Burke said.
"It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not," Burke added.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the government was not in contact with any member of the cohort, but he threatened charges would apply if they came back to Australia.
"Australian citizens have rights and they also have responsibilities, and those responsibilities mean that the Australian government, like with anyone else, will apply the full force of the law to anyone who has broken Australian law," he told Sky News.
"Is Australia providing repatriation, which did occur in 2019 and 2022? No is the answer to that."
Labor has been under pressure from the opposition to block the entire group from entering Australia, however Albanese said his government was operating under laws introduced by the Coalition.
"When it comes to the issue of citizenship, that has rights as well under our constitution," the prime minister said. "There are issues there and the Coalition know that is the case."
Opposition defence spokesman James Paterson reiterated that the government should do more to stop the cohort's arrival.
"It is very clear that the government can refuse a passport to an Australian citizen if they receive advice from a competent authority like ASIO or the AFP if a person is a threat to security," he said. "Denying their passport would deal with that threat to security."
The granting of a temporary exclusion order to one of the cohort meant further orders could be granted, Paterson added. "Those powers need to be used and this government seems very reluctant to use them," he said.

Teens find body in northern Israel ravine during climb

09:52:33 KST

Three teenage boys on a rock-climbing training hike in northern Israel made a grim discovery Friday when they found the body of a man in his 20s in the Amud Stream nature reserve.
The teens, residents of the Galilee community of Kahal, spotted the body among rocks and dense vegetation in the early afternoon. Authorities said a preliminary assessment indicates the man fell to his death from a significant height roughly 12 hours before he was found.
Security forces rushed to the scene despite the initial report that a body had been located, holding out hope that the man might still be alive. An Israeli Air Force helicopter carrying a team from the elite 669 search-and-rescue unit was dispatched to the area. A physician who was lowered to the rugged site pronounced the man dead at the scene.
The victim’s car was later located in a nearby parking lot at the Moshel Kahal area, and his family was notified. The body was transferred from the Upper Galilee to the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for examination to determine the precise cause of death. Police said they are investigating the circumstances.
The task of recovering the body was assigned to volunteers from the Galil-Golan police search-and-rescue unit, who were responding to their fifth life-saving callout in the past week. Working in difficult and complex terrain, rescuers used rope systems in an operation that required advanced technical skill. The unit said the mission was carried out under real risk to volunteers, reflecting their commitment to retrieving every person from the field, even when rescue is no longer possible.
Behind the scenes, the operation sparked controversy. Inbal Shoham, the mother of one of the teenagers who found the body and a candidate in the Democrats party primary, criticized the conduct of authorities at the scene.
In a social media post, Shoham alleged that her son and his friends were left alone at the site for hours and were instructed by police and the Magen David Adom emergency service to photograph, document and help guide responders. She said the teens were required to repeatedly climb up and down the ravine to assist arriving forces and claimed that adult hikers in the area refused to help. “They stayed there and managed the incident until forces arrived,” Shoham wrote.
Speaking to ynet, Shoham clarified that her criticism was not directed at the volunteer rescue unit but at police officers who she said did not immediately descend to the rocky, brush-covered ravine where the body lay. She said the teens found themselves near the scene for about two hours, effectively “managing” the situation while assisting search and rescue teams who had difficulty accessing the site. She also alleged that forensic investigators did not descend to collect documentation or investigate the fall and instead relied on photographs the teens were asked to take.
Israel Police and the Galil-Golan rescue unit rejected Shoham’s claims, saying management of the scene and the recovery operation were conducted in accordance with established operational protocols for such complex terrain. Volunteers from the unit said rescue and recovery personnel were alongside the body at all stages, from the arrival of Unit 669 and the police rescue team until the body was extracted.

Artist creates ‘Latin American Mona Lisa’ with plastic bottle caps
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
SAN SALVADOR - Call it a Renaissance in recycling.
A massive mural made of plastic bottle caps depicts Latin America’s version of the famed Mona Lisa, adorning a modest apartment building in a working class neighbourhood outside the capital of El Salvador instead of the walls of the Louvre.
Using a rainbow of colours and various sizes of caps, Venezuelan artist Oscar Olivares’s latest installation is 13m tall and takes inspiration from Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci as well as the pointillist paintings of French artist Paul Signac.
“I wanted to portray a Latin American Mona Lisa,” Mr Olivares told AFP.
The mural is in Zacamil, in the Mejicanos suburb of San Salvador – an area that was once controlled by violent gangs, whose activity has been curbed by President Nayib Bukele’s controversial security crackdown.
“The Mona Lisa is an ordinary woman, and she’s an icon of the Italian Renaissance” – and now “we are living through a new Renaissance, both in El Salvador and the world,” Mr Olivares said.
Completed in three weeks, the composition is made of more than 100,000 recycled bottle caps, after they were gathered by local residents over several months, washed and sorted.
Instead of the muted palette of the Italian countryside, Mr Olivares replaced da Vinci’s pastoral background with bright depictions of homes, a bold blue mountain and a colorful checkerboard sky.
And it wouldn’t be the Mona Lisa without her penetrating gaze and that ever-elusive smile, this time seen on a sun-kissed face rendered with red, orange and yellow caps.
Her jewelry, hairstyle and colorful dress evoke a modern Latina woman’s graces.
Mr Olivares has created murals using plastic caps in Venezuela, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, France and Italy, finding use for over 2 million caps in more than two dozen murals.
He hopes his work will give viewers “a completely different view of plastic waste.” AFP

Nine bodies recovered in deadly California avalanche, officials say

LOS ANGELES - The bodies of nine skiers who were killed in an avalanche in the mountains near Lake Tahoe
A ninth victim who had been missing was found and recovered along with four other victims on Feb 20, Lt. Dennis Haack of the Nevada County sheriff’s office said at an afternoon news conference.
Four other victims were recovered on the morning of Feb 21, according to the sheriff’s office.
“While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Ms Shannan Moon, the sheriff.
The avalanche on Feb 17 was the deadliest in modern California history. The victims were part of a group of 15 people, including four professional guides, finishing up a three-day backcountry trek through Castle Peak, a remote part of the Sierra Nevada.
The group had set out on its expedition on Feb 15 even as the region anticipated its first big blizzard of the year and an avalanche prediction center had warned of a “high” danger level for travel in avalanche-prone areas.
Officials for the first time identified the victims, including a group of six women and three of the group’s guides, two men and one woman. The six women were Carrie Atkin, 46; Liz Clabaugh, 52; Danielle Keatley, 44; Kate Morse, 45; Caroline Sekar, 45; and Kate Vitt, 43.
Family members, who had previously identified the women, said they were a friend group, including two sisters, who regularly took trips to the Lake Tahoe area. Several were from the Bay Area. The three guides, who worked for Blackbird Mountain Guides, were Andrew Alissandratos, 34; Michael Henry, 30; and Nicole Choo, 42.
Officials said on Feb 21 that the recovery operations began on Feb 20, after they took steps to reduce the threat of further avalanches in the area and deemed conditions safe enough to send in rescuers. A storm that passed on Feb 19 also had complicated recovery efforts.
All of the bodies were hoisted out using helicopters and taken to a staging area near Frog Lake huts, where the group of skiers had been lodging before their trip, officials said. The ninth victim, who had been missing, was found “relatively close to where everyone else was located”, Mr Haack said.
Officials had previously said the ski group had been caught in an avalanche about the size of a football field around 11.30am on Feb 17. Six survivors, four men and two women, were rescued after using avalanche beacons and the SOS satellite function on their iPhones.
Rescuers had travelled for several hours in a snowcat, a treaded vehicle, over difficult terrain before finally reaching the survivors around 5.30pm on Feb 17, according to the county sheriff’s office. The survivors led the rescue team to the remains of three people, and rescuers later located five other victims. NYTIMES

Epstein survivor slams Les Wexner’s ‘abhorrent’ testimony
Maria Farmer says she ‘suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’ at Wexner’s estate
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse has spoken out against billionaire Leslie Wexner, describing his recent deposition to members of Congress as “abhorrent.”
Wexner, the 88-year-old founder of retail conglomerate L Brands, sat for a nearly five-hour deposition Wednesday with members of the House Oversight Committee. Lawmakers subpoenaed Wexner after the latest release of the so-called Epstein files by the Department of Justice revealed new details about his relationship with the dead sex offender, who once worked as his financial adviser.
Appearing in the Epstein files does not imply wrongdoing, and Wexner has never been charged with a crime. Wexner has also denied knowing about Epstein’s criminal activity.
“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement ahead of the interview. “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.”
Maria Farmer, who said she was abused by Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell at Wexner’s estate decades ago, has now accused the retail mogul of “downplaying his relationship with Epstein” during his deposition.
“I am glad Wexner’s deposition, this lever of power, is being used to try to achieve some accountability and justice for the many survivors whose trauma has for so long been ignored, dismissed, or discounted,” Farmer said in a statement shared with The Independent Saturday.
“Wexner’s reported downplaying of his relationship with Epstein is abhorrent, particularly given Maxwell’s own description of him as Epstein’s closest friend. I am also troubled by Wexner’s stated lack of knowledge about my abuse and suffering on his property,” she added.
Farmer said the abuse began 30 years ago.
“In the summer of 1996, I served as the artist-in-residence at Les Wexner’s estate. I was instructed to obtain a driver’s license using the address of Wexner’s home,” she said. “Later that summer, while working and living on Wexner’s estate, I suffered abuse at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.”
Farmer’s statement included a photo of her driver’s license at the time, which appears to list an Ohio address.
She also said Epstein stole photographs of her and her minor sisters, which she described as “private anatomically-revealing photographs I used for artistic reference and kept numbered in a lockbox.”
“When I attempted to escape Wexner’s estate, I was threatened by his employees and associates, sharpshooters, guns and guard dogs, and held against my will,” she added.
Farmer said she eventually escaped and reported Epstein and Maxwell to law enforcement.
“I told the FBI about Epstein and Maxwell’s sexual abuse of me on Wexner’s estate, the theft there of the images, and being held on Wexner’s estate,” she said.
Farmer’s report to the FBI was included in a trove of Epstein-related files released late last year. The document reveals Farmer told the agency Epstein stole photos she had taken of her 12- and 16-year-old sisters. Farmer later said in an interview this included nude photos, according to The New York Times
A spokesperson for Wexner directed The Independent to his opening statement to the committee, during which he acknowledged “the survivors of Epstein’s terrible crimes and the devastation that each of them has endured as a result,” and said his “heart goes out to each of them.”
“As Mr. Wexner testified, he never even heard of Maria Farmer until her account surfaced in the media,” the spokesperson told The Independent. “Ms. Farmer’s statement is incorrect in many respects. Contrary to her statement, Epstein’s house, where the abuse is said to have occurred, was not on land owned by the Wexners, was nearly one half mile away from the Wexner home, and was accessed through a separate driveway not controlled by Wexner security. There were no sharp shooters or guard dogs policing Epstein’s property.”
The Independent has requested additional comment from a representative for Farmer.
Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria’s Secret, has said he cut ties with Epstein in 2007 after discovering the financier was stealing from him. Epstein pleaded guilty to state-level charges of soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008.
He told lawmakers Wednesday he was “conned by the World Olympic, all-time con artist.”
“As far as I was concerned, once we knew how bad he was, he was dead,” he said.
When asked about Farmer, Wexner replied: “I never met her, didn’t know she was here, didn’t know she was abused.”
The deposition also made headlines after Wexner’s attorney, Michael Levy, was caught on a hot mic telling him, “I will f***ing kill you if you answer another question with more than five words.”
The Independent has contacted Maxwell’s attorney for comment.

Huckabee draws backlash over claim Israel has right to much of Middle East

Muslim and Arab nations on Saturday condemned remarks by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who said in an interview that Israel has a biblical right to control territory described in the Bible as the “Promised Land,” an area that would encompass much of today’s Middle East.
In the interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked about the biblical promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit land stretching “from the Nile to the Euphrates,” a territory spanning from Egypt through parts of modern-day Syria and Iraq. Carlson asserted that such a description would effectively include most of the Middle East and asked whether Israel was entitled to that land.
“That would be the Levant. So that would be Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon. It would also be big parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq,” Carlson said. “It would be,” Huckabee replied, appearing somewhat uncomfortable.
“Israel is a land that God gave through Abraham to a people that he chose. It was a people, a place and a purpose,” added Huckabee, an evangelical Christian. Pressed again by Carlson on whether the Jewish people have a right to all the territory mentioned in the Bible, Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.”
Huckabee emphasized that Israel has no intention of expanding into those areas, but the comments quickly drew backlash.
Saudi Arabia called the ambassador’s remarks “dangerous” and “irresponsible.” In a statement, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said it “strongly condemns the statements of the U.S. ambassador to Israel, in which he recklessly suggested that Israeli control over all of the Middle East would be acceptable.” The ministry said the comments violated international law, the UN Charter and diplomatic norms.
“This extremist rhetoric portends grave consequences and threatens international peace and security by antagonizing the countries and peoples of the region and undermining the foundations of the international order,” the statement said.
“In this regard, the Kingdom reiterates its firm and longstanding position rejecting any actions that undermine the sovereignty, borders, and territorial integrity of states. It stresses that the only path toward a just and comprehensive peace is ending the occupation based on the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
Jordan described the remarks as “an infringement on the sovereignty of the countries of the region.” Egypt’s Foreign Ministry said Israel “has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands,” calling the statement a “blatant violation of international law.”
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry protested Huckabee’s agreement with the idea that Israel has a biblical right to rule from the Nile to the Euphrates, saying the remarks contradict religious and historical facts, international law and the declared position of President Donald Trump opposing annexation of the West Bank.
The Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation also issued condemnations, saying the comments were extreme and provocative and do not reflect official U.S. policy. The Arab League said such statements “serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions.”
Later, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the Palestinian Authority, along with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council, released a joint statement expressing “strong condemnation and deep concern” over Huckabee’s remarks. The statement said it would be unacceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the West Bank.
The interview also drew attention for additional controversial comments by Carlson. During the exchange, Carlson questioned whether Jews are truly descendants of Abraham and suggested conducting DNA tests on all residents of the land to determine who the “real” descendants are.
Neither the Israeli government nor the Trump administration immediately responded to the criticism.
The interview gained additional attention after Carlson claimed that members of his team had been detained for questioning at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport, an assertion denied by both Israeli authorities and the U.S. administration.
Carlson, who for years hosted a popular prime-time program on Fox News and was once considered relatively mainstream within the U.S. conservative movement, was dismissed by the network in 2023 following a defamation lawsuit tied to false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Since then, he has become a prominent podcaster whose videos on the social media platform X draw tens of millions of views.
In recent years he has adopted a more hard-line and isolationist stance within the pro-Trump MAGA movement and has frequently criticized Israel, at times promoting conspiracy theories, including allegations that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency operated disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announce new operations
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country's leadership.
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted "an individual of the apostate Syrian regime" in the city of Mayadin in Deir az-Zour province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria's Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by "unknown assailants." A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army's 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria's leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former leader of an al Qaeda affiliate who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had "moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation."
The group said it had begun a "new phase of operations" in Syria, describing Sharaa as a "watchdog" of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Sharaa signed Syria's accession to the global coalition to defeat IS during a visit to the US last November, when he met President Donald Trump.
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir az-Zour that killed a member of the Interior Ministry's internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting IS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
IS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Sharaa and two senior cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by IS.

Is it time for the EU to stop funding the Palestinian Authority?

Is it time for the EU to stop funding the Palestinian Authority?
The European Union and its member states have long presented themselves as supporters of the Palestinian people, mainly through their backing of the Palestinian Authority (PA). But is this actually ‘solidarity’ with Palestinian aspirations, or a tool to perpetuate the Israeli occupation?
In reality, the consistent support that the EU has given the PA is more of a token gesture, rather than a true effort toward Palestinian liberation and justice. Rather than challenging and confronting the Israeli occupation and its complicity through sanctions, the EU’s support has become a tool for managing it.
In 1980, the EU’s position on Palestine was officially formed in the Venice declaration. That declaration articulated the “two-state” logic by recognising Israel’s “right to exist” along with other vague statements around “justice for all the people” and Palestinian rights to self-determination and right to return.
In the 1990s, during the negotiations leading to the Oslo Accords, the EU solidified its position. It viewed this period as a key opportunity to position itself as a champion of Palestinian statehood, invoking “international law and the principles of Oslo.” However, at its core, the EU understood the creation of the Palestinian Authority (PA), established as a temporary administrative body under Israeli occupation, as a mechanism to ensure the continuity of the Zionist project, with little or almost no regard for Palestinian rights.
Former Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami described the role of the Palestinian Authority following Oslo as “Israel’s collaborator”, tasked with oppressing any political or social uprisings against the Israeli occupation and reducing the Palestinian struggle to economic reforms and security issues.
In 1997, the EU signed the Interim Association Agreement on Trade and Cooperation with the PA. This agreement has served as the legal basis of the EU-PA relations. Since then, the EU started offering up to €300 million a year to the PA, focused on projects related to economic development and infrastructure - a code for PA stability amidst Israel’s occupation.
Doubling down
Under Ursula von der Leyen’s leadership, the European Commission has understood that the Zionist project, realised through the state of Israel, faces existential threats.
As European public opinion and civil mobilisation grow increasingly critical of the EU–Israel strategic alliance, Brussels has doubled down on sustaining that project by further instrumentalizing the Palestinian Authority (PA). It has increasingly presented the PA as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.
Almost two months into Israel’s genocide in Gaza, in late November 2023, former EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell argued that a Palestinian state offers Israel's best security guarantee, linking it to the stability of the PA. December 2023 saw €118 million provided for PA stability; July 2024 brought €400 million in emergency grants and loans tied to governance reforms, anti-corruption, and education.
On April 14, 2025, the EU hosted its first high-level dialogue with the PA in Luxembourg, proposing a €1.6 billion 2025-27 program - €620 million as direct PA budget support - for recovery and resilience. June 2025 added over €150 million, channelled via mechanisms like PEGASE for salaries and fiscal gaps. In 2025 alone, the PA has received €172 million in financial assistance from the EU.
In doing so, the EU seeks to mislead millions of Europeans who have taken to the streets demanding an end to EU-Israel relations. It attempts to convince audiences that the EU’s support for the Palestinian Authority (PA) equates to backing the Palestinian struggle.
In reality, the PA has long lost its legal and moral legitimacy. Its president has remained in power since 2005 without elections, and the institution is widely seen by Palestinians as a symbol of corruption, nepotism, clientelism, and the repression of dissent.
A staggering 87% of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza believe that the PA is corrupt.
To sympathetic observers abroad, it may appear as a government-in-waiting, steadily building the institutions of a future state. But on the ground, and for the majority of Palestinians, it is widely perceived as an elite clinging to power, serving Israel’s interests (and its Western allies), and maintaining a façade of economic progress under an ever-expanding settler-colonial project that devours the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem piece by piece, day after day.
Under Israel’s control at all times
Following the US‑backed peace plan, supported by Israel and allies like the EU, which identified education reform as a central element, the PA recently introduced major changes to the national school curriculum. The revisions remove much of the national content and adjust historical and cultural narratives, softening or eliminating references to the occupation, expulsion, and injustice while promoting narratives of peace and coexistence.
Lessons that previously focused on Palestinian political prisoners have been replaced with topics on extremism and broader social issues.
As Israel deepens its de facto annexation of the West Bank, the European Union’s billions in aid, taken from European taxpayers and given to the PA, are being wasted. Stripped of any real political or sovereign authority, the PA is only a local administrator of services under Israeli military control.
The EU, including its left-leaning parties, must face an uncomfortable truth: the Palestinian Authority represents no one but itself. It wields no power on the ground and cannot gain any while Israel’s military occupation endures and corruption eats its institutions.
Equally, the EU must confront reality: the so‑called two‑state solution, long used to justify political and financial support for the PA, is no longer viable. Decades of impunity for Israel’s settler‑colonial and apartheid regime have rendered it obsolete. Moreover, allowing anyone other than Palestinians to determine their future denies them their fundamental right to self‑determination, a right that belongs to them alone.
Instead of clinging to a failed model that entrenches injustice, the EU must first end its complicity in Israel’s occupation and then support the emergence of new, accountable Palestinian leadership. Only when the occupation ends can a truly representative leadership, reflective of people’s realities and wishes, arise to lead the struggle for justice, and ultimately lasting peace.

Kemi Badenoch pledges to cut interest paid on student loans
The Tories have promised to limit the rate on Plan B loans
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Kemi Badenoch has pledged to cut the amount of interest paid on some student loans amid widespread concerns over costs.
The Tories have promised to limit the rate on Plan B loans to the retail price index (RPI) in a move that will heap further pressure on the Treasury.
Following Chancellor Rachel Reeves' November budget, the salary threshold at which repayments kick in under the system will be frozen at £29,385 for three years, leading to many having to pay more.
Interest on Plan 2 loans is charged at the rate of RPI inflation plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns.
The Conservative leader has announced plans to restrict this to RPI only, which the Tories argue would help higher numbers of graduates pay off their debt.
Ms Reeves has suggested the Government will be able to cut repayments on student loans by bringing down inflation, after a backlash to last November's budget announcement.
She said earlier this month: "By getting inflation down, we can also reduce the interest on student loans and I think that will make a big difference in making that more affordable."
Campaigners have accused the Treasury of acting like a loan shark, while Labour's deputy leader, Lucy Powell, described existing interest rates on Plan B loans as egregious and suggested the burden was unfair.
The Conservatives want to cut the number of university entrants by 100,000, which they say would save the Government £3.6 billion, and fund the same number of extra apprenticeships for 18 to 21-year-olds, as part of a "new deal for young people", the Sunday Times reported.
Young UK citizens starting their first full-time job would also see the first £5,000 of national insurance they pay put into a personal savings account, which could be used to buy a home.
Writing for the Telegraph, Mrs Badenoch said: "I am horrified at what graduates today are dealing with, and this is one of the reasons millions of young people feel they've been stitched up.
"Plan 2 student loans, the system most people who started university from 2012 to 2023 are on, increasingly feel like a scam."
She added: "If we want a country that rewards work, builds skill, and restores pride in practical achievement, we have to stop looking down on the very training routes that build the country."
The Treasury has been contacted for comment.

BERLIN, February 22. /TASS/. The United States may play a key role in the potential resumption of the Nord Stream pipelines’ work, German daily Berliner Zeitung reported citing its sources.
According to the daily, Washington may start delivering the Russian natural gas to Europe again, hoping to expand the United States' control over the energy infrastructure in the region. The German daily reports that negotiations, which are closed to the public and media, are allegedly underway on the possible resumption of the Nord Stream pipelines’ work.
French daily Le Monde diplomatique also reported earlier that informal contacts regarding the possible resumption of Nord Stream work are held without the participation of international institutions and are closed to the public. The daily called it "behind-the-scenes diplomacy."
Unprecedented damage to three strings of the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 offshore gas pipelines was recorded on September 26, 2022. The Russian Prosecutor General’s Office opened a criminal case into an act of international terrorism.

Police detain two men who shot at Aidar soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk region
According to Ukrinform, the regional police reported this on Telegram.
It is noted that the incident occurred on February 20 at approximately 4:00 p.m. in the city center.
"The suspects provoked a conflict with Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers. During the clash, one of the suspects fired several shots from an object resembling a pistol toward the soldiers. In addition, one of the servicemen was injured during the conflict," the report said.
Law enforcement officers inspected the scene and interviewed witnesses.
During the initial operational and investigative actions, the police identified the participants in the conflict and detained them. They turned out to be locals, aged 37 and 42.
The suspects were notified of their suspicion of committing a criminal offense under Part 4 of Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The decision on which preventive measure to choose for them is being made.
As reported, in one of the cities of the Dnipropetrovsk region, a group of unknown persons attacked servicemen of the Aidar regiment. During the attack, one of the attackers used a firearm.

Woman arrested after suspected terrorist attack kills police officer, injures 25 in western Ukraine’s Lviv
A woman has been arrested in connection with a suspected terrorist attack — believed by Ukrainian officials to have been ordered by Russia — that killed a police officer and injured 25 others in the western city of Lviv in the early hours of Feb. 22.
"The police, in cooperation with the Security Service of Ukraine, have arrested a suspected saboteur," Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, said on Sunday morning.
According to Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi, the detainee is a woman and a citizen of Ukraine.
Two blasts rocked Lviv’s historic Old Town in the early hours of Feb. 22, shattering windows in the area.
The explosions took place after officers arrived at the scene responding to a reported store intrusion, Ukraine’s National Police said in a statement. A second explosion took place after another police crew arrived at the scene, Lviv Oblast’s Prosecutor’s Office added.
Ukraine’s national police identified the police officer killed in the explosion as 23-year-old Viktoria Shpylka. Six other law enforcement officers are hospitalized in serious condition, they said.
"There is every reason to believe that the crime was carried out on the orders of Russia. It’s not the first time that the enemy has deliberately set up deadly traps for Ukrainian law enforcement officers," Klymenko said.
Marco, a 38-year-old Lviv resident walking his dog on the morning of Feb. 22, told a Kyiv Independent journalist at the scene that the attack was "nothing new," recalling terrorist attacks in Lviv in 2014–2015 suspected to be connected to Russia.
"Give long-range weapons to Ukraine so that we can finish this war," he said.
Explosions were heard by a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground at approximately 12:25 a.m. local time.
"My condolences to the families. All necessary resources have been provided to the investigation," Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in a Telegram post on Feb. 22.

NYC nursing walkout ends as last striking nurses approve new contract
Thousands of nurses at a major New York hospital system have approved a new contract, voting to end a strike after more than a month
- Bookmark
Nurses at a big New York hospital system approved a new contract Saturday, voting to end a major nursing strike after more than a month.
More than 4,000 nurses in the privately run NewYork-Presbyterian system went on strike Jan. 12. They are now due to start returning to work in the coming week. The union, called the New York State Nurses Association, said 93% of its members at NewYork-Presbyterian voted to ratify the three-year contract.
Two other big private hospital systems, Montefiore and Mount Sinai, ended their nurses’ walkout earlier this month by inking contract agreements with the same union.
“We are so happy with the wins we achieved, and now the fight to enforce these contracts and hold our employers accountable begins,” union President Nancy Hagans said in a statement Saturday.
NewYork-Presbyterian said that it looked forward to its nurses' return and that the contract "reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play as part of our exceptional care teams.”
Both sides had said Friday that they had reached a tentative deal. Union members voted on it Friday and Saturday.
Provisions included staffing improvements, raises topping 12% over three years and safeguards on the use of artificial intelligence, according to the union.
The union has said the strike initially involved about 15,000 nurses overall at Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian. It affected only some facilities within the three systems and didn't involve any city-run hospitals.
During the strike, Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian brought on thousands of temporary nurses, transferred some patients and canceled some procedures. The hospitals insisted they were smoothly delivering care, including complex surgeries. But some vulnerable patients and their families said some routine tasks took longer.
The strikers complained of unmanageable workloads and accused the hospitals of trying to chip away at health benefits. The hospitals contested those claims and said the union’s demands were exorbitant.
Nurses at some Mount Sinai and Montefiore hospitals also walked out in 2023. That strike ended in three days.

Minister reveals process has started to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate laws
In short:
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke says ASIO has determined the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir meets the threshold to be banned under new hate group laws.
This is the first of two steps to ban the group under the laws passed last month.
Mr Burke also gave an update on the 34 Australians in Syria, saying the one woman he had temporarily blocked from entering the country was "very different" to the others.
The first step towards banning the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir under new hate laws is complete, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has revealed.
The minister has also defended the government's handling of the group of Australians with links to Islamic State, saying it had been guided by the advice of ASIO.
Mr Burke told the ABC's Insiders he had been advised by ASIO that Hizb ut-Tahrir met the threshold to be listed under the new legal regime, which was established after the Bondi attack to capture those deemed to spread hate but not captured by existing laws.
Hizb ut-Tahrir was one of two groups the government had named as its main targets. The other, neo-Nazi group the National Socialist Network, disbanded in January.
Mr Burke said the next stage was a departmental briefing to satisfy him that the group increased the risk of hate-motivated violence, after which the opposition leader would be briefed and the attorney-general could sign off on a ban.
"The ASIO advice is now in. This is the first time we have been able to ban, potentially, a group which falls short of a terrorist listing," he said.
"It says you don't have to be specifically calling for, but you do have to be acting in a way that increases the risk of communal violence or politically-motivated violence."
The laws were passed in January with the support of the Liberal Party, but were opposed by the Nationals and the Greens who argued the scope was too broad.
Jonathon Duniam, the Coalition's home affairs spokesperson, welcomed the news, describing Hizb ut-Tahrir as a "hideous and insidious organisation".
"We've talked about it long enough … We are pleased this is happening, this is what we wanted to see with the laws," he said.
One member of Syria cohort a higher risk than others, Burke says
Mr Burke also responded to criticism from the Coalition that the government should be doing more to prevent a cohort of Australian citizens from leaving a refugee camp in Syria and returning to Australia.
The group of 34 women and children with links to former Islamic State fighters made a first, unsuccessful, attempt to leave Syria last week. A group of Australians has travelled to assist them and has Australian passports for them.
On Monday, Mr Burke issued one of the women with a temporary exclusion order, an effective blocker on an Australian return which he has the power to impose when an individual is deemed to pose a security threat.
But the opposition has questioned whether further exclusion orders should apply, and whether the government should have used its powers under the Passport Act to deny passport applications on security grounds.
"It's very clear… that the government can refuse a passport to an Australian citizen if they receive advice from a competent authority like ASIO or the AFP [Australian Federal Police] that that person is a threat to security," shadow defence spokesperson James Paterson told Sky News.
Mr Burke said none of the other 33 members of the group had been assessed by ASIO as meeting the bar for a temporary exclusion order.
"The cohort is not consistent," he said. "There are very different people in that cohort with different histories, and different states of mind if I put it in those terms.
"They are quite different, but our agencies have been following them for a long time. The fact that one person has been pulled out… for a temporary exclusion order is because, quite specifically, of what we know about that individual."
Mr Burke said the last time Australian officials had been on the ground in Syria and able to interview members of the cohort was in 2022, but that agencies "never stopped collecting information on people" and he would be guided by their advice.
While the minister does have powers to impose a temporary exclusion order without advice from ASIO, Mr Burke noted his decisions were subject to independent review and would be "thrown out" if he did not have sufficient grounds.
He added that the threshold for blocking a passport was higher than the threshold for imposing a temporary exclusion order and suggested none of the 34 met the bar, but did not elaborate on the difference.
Mr Burke denied a report in The Australian suggesting the government had written to Kurdish authorities overseeing the al-Roj camp, where the group remain, describing them as "terrorists", suggesting this was a misunderstanding due to "language issues".
He also denied a report in the Daily Telegraph that the federal government had held meetings with state governments to discuss repatriating the group.
Mr Burke said federal and state authorities had met to discuss security arrangements when it became apparent the group might return, but that the government was not assisting with repatriation.
Senator Duniam said the government was "not doing enough" and that the opposition was willing to work with the government to pass new laws to stop the return of the cohort.
"They are coming and this government is letting it happen … The best outcome here would be for these people not to come back to Australia," he said.
Senator Duniam said Mr Burke should "not hide behind advice" if his view was that the other members of the cohort were not a security threat.
"If he's so confident … he should say so," he said.

Kuwait summons Iraqi diplomat over Baghdad’s filing of maritime coordinates with UN

Kuwait has summoned Iraq’s chargé d’affaires to protest Baghdad’s submission to the UN of maritime coordinates and a map, saying the submission “infringes on Kuwaiti sovereignty” over established maritime areas.
The Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iraq “had deposited a list of coordinates and a map with the UN that included claims regarding Iraqi maritime domains.”
It said the coordinates and map affect its sovereignty over maritime areas and fixed water elevations, including Fasht Al-Qaid and Fasht Al-Aij, which it described as not subject to any dispute regarding Kuwait’s full sovereignty.
The ministry said Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Rahim Al-Daihani summoned Zaid Abbas Shanshal “to deliver a formal protest note over Iraqi claims affecting Kuwait’s maritime sovereignty and related water elevations.”
Kuwait urged Iraq to take into account the historical ties between the two countries and to act responsibly in accordance with international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and bilateral understandings and agreements.
The UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 and establishes a comprehensive legal framework governing the world’s oceans, setting rules for the allocation of states’ rights and jurisdiction in maritime zones, the peaceful use of seas and oceans, and the management of marine resources.
Earlier Saturday, Iraq’s Foreign Ministry said it had deposited updated lists of coordinates for Iraq’s territorial sea baselines and maritime zones with the UN secretary-general on January 19 and February 9, in accordance with UNCLOS provisions.
It said the submission includes the determination of straight baselines and baselines drawn along the low-water line for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea, as well as the delimitation of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf of Iraq, in accordance with the internationally recognised World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84).
Baghdad said the deposit replaces previous submissions dated December 7, 2021, and April 15, 2011, and aims “to update Iraq’s maritime data in line with the provisions of international law and enhance the legal clarity of the boundaries of maritime zones subject to Iraq’s sovereignty and sovereign rights.”
Iraq also said the coordinates and chart have been published on the website of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea and reiterated its commitment to international law and regional stability.

All nine bodies of skiers killed in California avalanche recovered

Officials announced on Saturday that the bodies of all nine missing skiers who were killed in a devastating avalanche in California had been recovered, following days of search efforts.
The avalanche happened in the Sierra Nevada mountains in northern California near Lake Tahoe, a popular skiing and winter sport destination. No more people are left missing after Tuesday’s deadly avalanche.
“While we wish we could have saved them all, we are grateful that we can bring them home,” said Nevada county sheriff Shannan Moon during a news conference on Saturday afternoon.
Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies that helped recover the bodies – from the California Highway Patrol to the National Guard to the Pacific Gas and Electric utility company – and 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
The sheriff named for the first time the three guides from Blackbird Mountain Company who died: Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
Saturday’s recovery of the bodies marked the end of a five-day effort to locate nine missing skiers after one of the deadliest avalanches in recent history.
On Saturday morning, officials and agencies were able to finish the rescue operations with the assistance of a Black Hawk helicopter in the snowy region. Earlier in the week, six survivors were rescued, with eight others discovered dead and one declared missing and presumed dead. Four of the bodies were recovered on Friday evening and the last five were recovered on Saturday morning.
Among those dead were six women and three professional guides. More than 40 rescuers from various local and federal agencies took part in the effort on Saturday, including the Nevada county sheriff’s office and the California highway patrol, along with the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Difficult weather and snowy conditions prevented the crews from rescuing the bodies earlier this week.
The avalanche has been the deadliest since 1981, with experts estimating the slide path was roughly the size of a football field, the AP reported.
In calls to dispatchers on Tuesday, it was reported that multiple skiers were reportedly buried by the avalanche. Later that night, rescuers and teams made contact with the six survivors and discovered others who had died. The teams were unable to recover the bodies due to brutal snowy conditions. The snow lab near Donner Pass had recorded 28in of snow that day with more expected and more avalanche risk warnings.
“I want to recognize the strength in the volunteers of all the search-and-rescue units that our agencies truly rely on,” Moon said. “They are pretty amazing people, and it’s an honor to work with them.”
The skiers had come from different parts of the US to enjoy a guided skiing tour last weekend. Their families said they were a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the Sierra Nevada wilderness. The group had skied out to cabins near Frog Lake, where they stayed for two nights before starting on their return trip when the avalanche hit.
They were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, all in their 40s. They lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The terrain will be off-limits to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, forest supervisor for the Tahoe national forest. Officials intended to restore public access once the investigation is complete.
“We are investigating the incident to determine if there were any factors that would be considered criminal negligence,” said a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. “It is too early to know if criminal charges will be applicable, as the investigation is preliminary and remains active and ongoing. The district attorney’s office would ultimately be the determining authority for any criminal charges to be filed.”

Ukraine accuses Hungary, Slovakia of ‘blackmail’ over threats to cut electricity
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV - Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned what it described as “ultimatums and blackmail” by the governments of Hungary and Slovakia on Feb 21, after they threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine unless Kyiv restarts flows of Russian oil.
Shipments of Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia have been cut off since Jan 27, when Kyiv says a Russian drone strike hit pipeline equipment
Slovakia and Hungary say Ukraine is to blame for the prolonged outage.
Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Feb 21 that he would cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine within two days unless Kyiv resumes Russian oil transit to Slovakia over Ukraine’s territory.
Hungary’s Viktor Orban made a similar threat days earlier.
The issue has become one of the angriest disputes yet between Ukraine and two neighbours that are members of the EU and NATO but whose leaders have bucked the largely pro-Ukrainian consensus in Europe to cultivate warm ties with Moscow.
Slovakia and Hungary are the only two EU countries that still rely on significant amounts of Russian oil shipped via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline over Ukraine.
“Ukraine rejects and condemns the ultimatums and blackmail by the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic regarding energy supplies between our countries,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
Between them, Hungary and Slovakia have been providing around half of European emergency electricity exports to Ukraine, which Kyiv increasingly relies on as Russian attacks have damaged its grid.
“If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine,” Mr Fico said in a post on X.
Kyiv said that such actions were “provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region.”
Throughout the war that began with the full-scale Russian invasion whose fourth anniversary falls on Feb 24, Ukraine has allowed its territory to be used for Russian energy exports to Europe, which have been sharply curtailed but not halted.
Ukraine has proposed alternative transit routes to ship oil to Europe while emergency pipeline repair works are under way.
In a letter seen by Reuters, the Ukrainian mission to the EU proposed shipments through Ukraine’s oil transportation system or a maritime route, potentially including the Odesa-Brody pipeline linking Ukraine’s main Black Sea port to the EU.
Since October 2025, Russia has intensified its drone and missile attacks on the Ukrainian energy system, knocking out electricity and heat and plunging millions of Ukrainians into long blackouts during bitterly cold winter temperatures. REUTERS

The U.S.’s Olympic Legacy in Figure Skating Will Be More Profound Than Medals

In the end, Ilia Malinin chose to rely on the medium he knows best to express his deepest thoughts. And despite his struggles at the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics, his skate at the Feb. 21 exhibition gala helped him to address those challenges and speak directly with the audience who had supported him along the way.
Malinin had been the heavy favorite to win gold at his first Olympics Games. During the men’s figure skating free program, he set out to make Olympic history by planning to land seven quadruple jumps in a single program—a technical feat that would have underscored his dominance in the skating world and landed him on top of the podium. He popped the first one he intended, the quad axel, which only he has landed in competition, but wasn’t able to muster enough of his remaining skills to stay ahead of his competitors. The self-styled “Quad God,” thought to be one of the sure things in the always unpredictable Olympics, finished eighth overall.
How Malinin skated that program, it turns out, was a message to the world—one that grappled with the weight of expectations that Malinin was dealing with. He hadn’t spoken publicly about the pressure he has been feeling, he says, throughout this Olympic season. Touted as the next Olympic champion, Malinin experienced extraordinary demands on his time and mental energy that eroded his confidence and led to his first loss in nearly two years.
More than a week later, skating in the Olympic exhibition gala, Malinin again chose to speak on the ice, with a program he has been working on for a few months with a friend who cut the music, called Fear, from one of his favorite artists, NF. The program is a sober representation of the loss of control Malinin says he’s been feeling as the hype and expectation around his Olympic debut built. He teased the routine following his free program, posting on his account a clip that depicts an overwhelming cascade of pinging social media alerts. He opened the program with the sounds of that flood of messages, and mimed scrolling through them before putting his hands to his head and flipping the hood of his grey sweatshirt, stamped with the word ‘Fear,’ over his head.
“I really just wanted to share an extension of my thoughts and something that I’ve been feeling for this whole Olympic season,” he says. “There’s been so much pressure, so much doubt, and everything around me, the noise, the media, the people, the environment—it’s been so overwhelming.”
The lyrics are especially poignant for Malinin: “Like a puppet, with strings, I just don’t have the choice. What’s the truth? What’s a lie? … “On the verge, on the edge, Is this what you wanted? Petrified, scared to death, Is this what you wanted?...Breakin’ down, spiralin’, Is this what you wanted? What you wanted? Is this what you wanted?”
The program was an emotional appeal to the public to see him as “a human being,” he said. “We also have real thoughts, real feelings, even though it looks like we’re completely like robots and [have] superhuman abilities. But in the end, deep inside, we’re still similar [to] all of you.”
Malinin, of course, isn’t the first to address the nearly impossible expectations that people put on celebrities or elite athletes, in particular Olympians. Gymnast Simone Biles has used similar words in describing the dangers of forgetting that athletes are people too—individuals who experience the same pressure, anxieties, and pain from hurtful remarks and uninformed criticism as anyone else.
But perhaps more than any previous Olympics, these Games, and this U.S. figure skating team in particular, have taken up the mantle of mental health, making it a priority, rather than an afterthought. The U.S. women’s squad of Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn, and Isabeau Levito has been making headlines for its uniquely close relationship, and questioning why they can’t successfully balance friendship and competition. When asked after making the Olympic team about the novelty of the strong bond between them, Liu seemed baffled, apparently not understanding why it was considered so unusual for them to be so close and supportive of one another.
But in skating—and among women in particular, such camaraderie hasn’t been the norm. Young girls are taught from early in their careers to hide their feelings, smile no matter what they’re experiencing inside, and never allow their rivals to see their weaknesses. The rigidity of that system is one of the reasons Liu quit the sport at 16, before deciding to return, on her own terms, two years later.
When Glenn missed a jump combination in the short program that put her in 13th place going into the final, it was Liu who was among the first to give her a hug and comfort her. She helped Glenn put the mistake behind her and skate a strong free program to pull up to fifth. And that supportive instinct extends beyond just her teammates. When Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto missed a jump in the free program and realized she would miss earning gold, her emotions overtook her and couldn’t stop the tears. Glenn stepped in to hug her and shield her from prying cameras that had zoomed in on the distraught Sakamoto.
To Glenn, Liu, and Levito, such expressions take precedence over medals or standings. “I’m thankful for the amount of success that we’ve had with that, because it’s not made us less competitive, it’s not led to any falters on the ice,” Glenn said. “That’s one of the most beautiful things about sport, it’s not just what we do out there when we perform, but the journey and the people who surround us during it. I think that is something that will improve so many athletes’ lives, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do.”
One of them will be Malinin, who will leave Milan “learning to get back up and keep going,” he says. “It’s still just figure skating. And sometimes the medals don’t mean as much as who you are as a person and what you truly bring to the world around you.”

‘We are not’: Burke rejects claims government repatriating IS brides
Updated ,first published
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke says national security and counterterrorism agencies have met to discuss any risks to security posed by the potential return of 34 women and children linked to Islamic State, but he denied the government was helping them come back to Australia.
Burke said one woman would be prohibited from returning from the al-Roj camp in north-east Syria, but intelligence agencies had not determined the remaining members of the so-called IS brides group posed a threat. The women and children have been issued Australian passports, which the government says is a legal requirement.
The minister denied that those moves amounted to assistance or repatriation, after a News Corp article reported that high-level briefings had been ongoing for months between NSW, Victoria and federal agencies to repatriate the group and make arrangements for their return.
“In that [News Corp] report, it makes a claim that we are conducting repatriation. We are not. It claims we have been meeting with the states for the purposes of a repatriation. We have not,” Burke said on the ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday morning.
“Our authorities meet with the state authorities to make sure that we are prepared if there is any chance of there being a heightened risk to national security.
“As soon as the conditions of the camp started to deteriorate, and there was a possibility some people would be getting out, which has happened … the national security teams, the joint counterterrorism teams, meet, as they did under the previous government, as they do now, as is essential for public safety.”
A NSW Premier’s Department spokesperson said state agencies were working with the federal government on law enforcement and security arrangements.
“NSW will continue working with Commonwealth agencies to manage any security risks. Any matters relating to warrants or arrests will be handled by NSW Police,” they said.
“NSW has well-established arrangements in place to manage any returnees, with community safety as the overriding priority. These arrangements were successfully implemented in 2019 and 2022 [when other cohorts returned to Australia].”
Former home affairs head Mike Pezzullo told a parliamentary inquiry in 2022 that the states and the federal government worked collaboratively on these issues.
“The joint counterterrorism teams in each of the states have a view about what needs to be done to mitigate the most egregious risks,” he said.
“If a state government chose to say, ‘We don’t want to proceed’, then I would have thought the Commonwealth would take that pretty seriously, because we have to rely on them for schooling, trauma support, counselling, public health support and the like. So it’s done consensually. All that information is put to them, and then they’ll give us the authority to proceed or otherwise.“
The Albanese government has taken a hard line against the group of Australian women and children who are attempting to leave the al-Roj camp, saying it is not assisting their return.
On the issue of them receiving passports, Burke said: “The process has happened as a bureaucratic process of officials obeying the law, and doing what they’re obliged to do by law, with nothing coming from any ministerial level encouraging that process along.”
But the Coalition is pressuring the government to deny the group re-entry to Australia with temporary exclusion orders, which are designed to protect Australians from national security risks.
One of the group of 34 has been prevented from returning to Australia under an exclusion order.
Burke said that woman had been deemed by intelligence agencies to pose a higher risk. He said the rest of the group had not met the threshold for exclusion orders, according to advice.
“Other than a temporary exclusion order, there isn’t a legislative power to stop an Australian citizen from entering Australia,” he said.
“One of my concerns with how the opposition have handled this, is they have effectively said the minister [should] be able to make it up ... as though somehow in national security portfolio you should ignore your national security intelligence and law enforcement agencies.”
Burke said agencies had been following the group of women and children for a long time, and each had different histories and states of mind. “The cohort is not consistent,” he said.
Asked whether the remaining 33 people did not pose a threat to Australia, Burke said: “That’s right.”
He said he would take seriously any advice to the contrary, but that “on the information we have, the best way to protect Australians has not involved any further temporary exclusion orders”.
Coalition home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam accused Burke of hiding behind advice.
“We haven’t seen that advice, and again it should be straightforward enough for the minister to allay concerns. If he is so confident that these people aren’t a risk, he should just say so, not hide behind advice,” Duniam said.
“These are people we don’t think should be back in this country and that pose a risk to our country. Now if the government are serious, and the minister himself said it again today, ‘we don’t want them back here’, do something about it.
“The Coalition have said that they would work with the government on laws to prevent re-entry of this cohort back into Australia, strengthen arrangements around temporary exclusion orders, strengthen arrangements around passport laws. There are ways of doing this.”

Maccabi Tel Aviv fan ban may have been politically influenced, say MPs
New report on the row also criticises Keir Starmer for heightening tensions
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Local political pressure may have influenced the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv football fans from attending a match against Aston Villa, a parliamentary committee has concluded.
The Home Affairs Committee said that Birmingham councillors had a “disproportionate opportunity to exert influence”, which undermined confidence that the decision was based on evidence and safety.
Supporters were barred from the 6 November game at Villa Park by the local safety advisory group (SAG), citing safety concerns based on advice from West Midlands Police (WMP).
A subsequent review revealed an "AI hallucination" generated by Microsoft Copilot had helped police to justify the ban.
Copilot erroneously referenced a non-existent match between Tel Aviv and West Ham.
Chief Constable Craig Guildford has since resigned from his position amid significant pressure following the controversy.
In a new report on the row, the Home Affairs Committee said it could not rule out that political pressure had played a part in the decision.
The report said WMP’s concerns about disorder “combined with local political pressure and community tensions related to the international situation” led to the move.
The report continued: “While we cannot conclude that the Safety Advisory Group’s decision was made because of political pressure, on the basis of the evidence we have seen we also cannot conclude with any confidence that the decision was not politically influenced.
“It is clear that on this occasion councillors, with a stated political aim, had a disproportionate opportunity to influence Safety Advisory Group decision-making on a deeply divisive political issue.
“While the presence of elected politicians on Safety Advisory Groups has potential benefits in terms of local representation, it also risks decision-making becoming politically motivated, undermining trust in the process.”
The Cabinet Office should ban local councillors from sitting on SAGs, the group of MPs said.
Chair of the Home Affairs Committee Dame Karen Bradley said: “It is an extraordinary measure to decide to ban fans from attending a fixture, particularly in the cultural and political climate that this occurred in.
“It is vital that trust is rebuilt. West Midlands Police must repair the damage that has been done by working hard to reach out to local communities, particularly Jewish communities.
“They must also ensure that there is a cultural shift around decision making where assumptions are tested and evidence fully checked.”
Elsewhere, the committee criticised ministers, including the prime minister and home secretary, for heightening tensions by criticising the move too late.
By intervening after the decision to ban away fans had already been publicly announced, the Government escalated the situation and was “ineffectual” in enabling the Israeli fans to attend, it said.
The Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport were told on 8 October 2025 that Maccabi fans were likely to be barred – a week before the decision was announced.
The Israeli team’s fans could still have been able to come “if the Government had intervened privately at this point”, the committee concluded.
On the day the decision was made public, Sir Keir Starmer posted on X calling it “the wrong decision” and saying the Government “will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets”.
The same day, Shabana Mahmood posted on X that the Government “is doing everything in our power to ensure all fans can safely attend the game”.
The public interventions increased the profile of the subsequent fixture, “which in turn increased risk”, the report concluded.

Malaysia’s vape ban plan leaves 1.4 million users in regulatory limbo

Malaysia’s vape ban plan leaves 1.4 million users in regulatory limbo
An estimated 1.4 million Malaysian adults vape, despite existing curbs. Many say new laws will simply push them back to cigarettes
The vapes used to be obvious. Bright displays of flavoured liquid, a shop just down the road, a transaction as unremarkable as buying shampoo. Batrisyia, 28, remembers how easy it was.
Those days are gone. Or rather, in Malaysia at least, the trade has moved under the table.
“It’s definitely less open now,” said Batrisyia, a Johor native who asked to be identified by a pseudonym for fear of backlash. “You don’t see big vape displays like before, and we can’t buy online any more. But it hasn’t disappeared. Some shops sell quietly behind the counter or in the back.”
She paused, holding a slim, pen-like device in her hand. “You just have to ask for it.”
The device is almost elegant in its simplicity: swap out the small pod cartridge, pick a flavour, inhale the vapour. It leaves no lingering smell on clothes or hands, none of cigarettes’ telltale signs. For Batrisyia, discretion was always part of the appeal.
In her small town of Pontian, at the southern tip of Peninsular Malaysia, that discretion has taken on a new dimension.

British submarine arrives for ‘extraordinary’ AUKUS visit

British submarine arrives for ‘extraordinary’ AUKUS visit
A British nuclear-powered submarine has arrived in Australia for an unprecedented month-long visit despite the well-chronicled problems plaguing the British navy’s ability to send its vessels to sea.
The British and Australian governments are holding up the visit as a sign of the countries’ commitment to the AUKUS pact, even as the United Kingdom views Russia as its most pressing security threat.
HMS Anson, an Astute-class nuclear-powered submarine, arrived on Sunday at the HMAS Stirling naval base in Perth for a month-long maintenance visit.
Defence Minister Richard Marles and Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy described the first such visit by a UK nuclear‑powered submarine in Australia as a “historic step in our nation’s readiness to operate and maintain conventionally armed, nuclear‑powered submarines”.
HMS Anson, which was commissioned in 2022, is reportedly the only available submarine in the British navy’s fleet of five Astute-class boats, highlighting the significance of the extended deployment to Australia.
British defence publication Navy Lookout has written that the “timing of the deployment seems extraordinary” as the British navy does not have any other Astute-class submarines available.
“The UK must continue to play its part in AUKUS, but in the short term, perhaps more local concerns should be the priority,” the publication argued this month.
“Placing the sole attack submarine on the other side of the globe appears to be at odds with vigorous official warnings to Russia that ‘any threat will be met with strength and resolve’.”
Navy Lookout said the British navy’s other four Astute-class submarines were “all at low or very low readiness”.
Conroy described the visit as “an important milestone that will build confidence in our strategic partners that we have the workforce able to deliver AUKUS submarines, and also lays ground for more jobs for locals”.
Two Australian navy officers have been embedded on the submarine to gain a better understanding of how nuclear-powered submarines operate.
The Australian navy will also conduct tests of its Speartooth large underwater drone to see how it operates with the British submarine at sea.
Britain’s deputy high commissioner to Australia, Brian Jones, said the visit “sends a simple message of our water-tight commitment to AUKUS”.
“Our security as the UK is global, and we are committed to contributing to the security and stability wherever that might be,” he said.
“Our shared prosperity with Australia depends on that security ... Deploying one of our most capable defence assets into this region reflects our commitment to work with our close partners to uphold peace, security and stability.”
According to the British navy, the Astute-class submarines “are the largest, most advanced and most powerful attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy, combining world-leading sensors, design and weaponry in a versatile vessel”.
While nuclear-powered, these submarines do not carry nuclear weapons.
American nuclear-powered submarines made similar maintenance visits to Australia in 2024 and 2025, following the announcement of the AUKUS delivery plan in 2023.
The plan involves the US selling Australia at least three Virginia-class submarines while the UK and Australia partner on the development of a new class of submarine known as the SSN-AUKUS.
US senator Tim Kaine told this masthead last week he believed there was a “100 per cent chance” the US would provide the submarines to Australia as promised despite sluggish production rates at American shipyards.
Retired rear admiral Philip Mathias, a former director of nuclear policy with the UK Ministry of Defence, told this masthead last month he feared Australians were not adequately informed about how the troubles plaguing the British navy could scuttle the SSN-AUKUS plan.
“Whilst the United States may sell some [nuclear-powered submarines] to Australia, there is a high probability that the UK element of AUKUS will fail,” he said.
Mathias, who led a 2010 review of the UK Trident nuclear-weapons system, said: “It is clear that Australia has shown a great deal of naivety and did not conduct sufficient due diligence on the parlous state of the UK’s nuclear submarine program before signing up to AUKUS – and parting with billions of dollars, which it has already started to do.”
The head of the British navy, First Sea Lord Gwyn Jenkins, ordered an urgent 100-day drive to tackle systemic delays in the UK submarine program in October.
UK publication Defence Eye reported that the British navy “has struggled to put more than one of its five Astute boats to sea at a time” and that “for a number of months over the past two years, no Astute boats have been at sea”.

Australian dual citizens scramble as UK border crackdown set to begin

UK passport changes leave Australians with dual citizenship scrambling before border rules kick in
In short:
Australians with British or Irish dual citizenship may be denied travel to the UK from February 25 unless they carry a valid British or Irish passport, or certificate of entitlement.
The rules were formally announced by the UK Home Office last year but many say they only became aware of the change via news reports in recent weeks.
What's next?
Travel industry leaders are calling on the UK government to delay the rollout, warning Australians could miss long-planned trips.
There are calls for the British government to delay tough new border rules set to take effect in days.
From Wednesday, dual citizens of the UK and Ireland will have to follow new passport regulations when entering the UK.
Travellers with dual citizenship will need to present a British or Irish passport, or a certificate of entitlement at border control checkpoints and airlines will enforce the new rules prior to departure.
The Australian government's Smartraveller advice is that these requirements will be strictly enforced, and Australians with dual citizenship may not be able to board flights to the UK unless they carry the right travel documents.
The rules also apply from non-Australian departure points, including by international rail, coach or ferry, with carriers required to check that passengers hold valid UK entry permission before boarding under the new UK Home Office "no permission, no travel" system.
Loading...The rules were formally announced by the UK Home Office last year but many say they only became aware of the change via news reports in recent weeks.
For many, the changes prompted a frantic search for documents needed to begin passport applications throwing long-planned trips into doubt, with critics slamming the government for poor communication.
Adding to frustrations, British passports and Certificates of Entitlement (COE) can take between three and six weeks to process.
Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) CEO Dean Long said the changes were "unethical" and he'd written to the UK Home Office urging them to extend the February 25 deadline.
"It is causing chaos … it's an ill-thought-through strategy that has unfortunately created massive disruption for thousands of people,"Mr Long said.
The British government said the new regulations were in line with other countries' border policies and would strengthen national security.
A holiday turned nightmare
For Laura Burke, from the New South Wales Central Coast, the rules have turned what should have been a joyful family trip into a logistical nightmare.
Laura, an Australian citizen born in England, booked non-refundable flights for a March trip to the UK with her husband and their two young children, including three-month-old Masie, for her step-father's 70th birthday.
What she thought would be routine — applying for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) using their Australian passports — quickly turned into a last-minute scramble.
"I was scrolling Facebook and saw a post about the new rules," Ms Burke said.
"At first, I thought we could just get ETAs. But then I realised Masie and our older daughter are considered British citizens by descent, even if they've never held British passports, so they have to have UK passports too."
She said efforts to reach the UK Passport Office and the British High Commission brought mixed responses and a lot of stress.
"I'd call one department and get told to call another," she said. "No-one would give a straight answer."
The family rushed to apply for overseas documents including the birth certificate of Laura's father and her parents' marriage certificate. They're still waiting on British passports for their children.
"We still don't know if we'll get them in time," she said.
"It's incredibly stressful … you don't want to cry, but it just means a lot, seeing family, meeting babies for the first time."
Race against time
Stephen Davis said his experience was similar.
Having left the UK decades ago, the Sydney Blue Mountains resident assumed he could enter the country on his Australian passport as he always had.
It was only after reading an ABC article outlining the new rules that he realised his fast-approaching trip to celebrate his friend's 70th birthday was in doubt.
"The travel agents I spoke to didn't know, my British friends and family didn't know. It makes you wonder how many others will get caught out," he said.
He initially tried to get an Emergency Travel Document but his British passport, which expired in 2008, was considered too old, meaning he had no choice but to apply for a full passport renewal.
"It's been incredibly stressful,"he said.
"I'm relatively tech-savvy and persistent but I can't imagine how challenging it would be for someone who isn't," he said.
"The lack of communication has been the frustrating part, it's been incredibly difficult to get the information I needed, I've spoken to so many different people, webchats, it's just been a nightmare."
Industry warns of chaos
The ATIA has written to Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong about their concerns.
"We're seeing significant disruption, cancellations and financial loss because people did everything right when they booked but have been blindsided by this change," Mr Long said.
"Many people don't even realise they are considered UK citizens until they're confronted with these requirements.
"They need time to decide whether to renew their passports, apply for certificates, or renounce citizenship altogether."
Confusion and calls to delay
Across social media and travel forums, frustration is mounting.
Hundreds of Australians contacted the ABC saying they feel misled, unaware of their dual citizenship status, or confused by contradictory online information about travel eligibility.
Some are even considering renouncing their UK citizenship to avoid the passport process, though doing so is neither straightforward nor inexpensive — the renunciation process can take months, involves significant fees, and may not be approved by the UK government.
The parents of dual citizens also cannot renounce their children's British citizenship on their behalf — applicants must be over 18.
The British government said the changes were necessary as part of modernising border controls.
In a statement to ABC, the British High Commission said the updated rules reflect the UK's move to a more digitised immigration system and are designed to improve security and efficiency.
What travellers should know
Australians planning travel to the UK from February 25, 2026 should be aware:
- Dual British/Irish citizens must enter the UK on a valid British or Irish passport or have a Certificate of Entitlement.
- Dual citizens will be required to carry both their Australian passport for exiting and entering Australia, and their British passport, for entering the UK.
- Dual citizens cannot use an ETA or visa to enter the UK.
- Airlines and carriers will enforce the requirements at check-in, not just at border control.
- Processing times for passports and certificates can take weeks, so travellers should act now.
More information is available at the Australian Government's Smartraveller site.

Feb 21 - An Oreo cookie plant in eastern Ukraine was struck by a Russian missile on Saturday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X, the second time the factory has been damaged since the war began in 2022.
No one was killed, but a production building was damaged, Sybiha wrote. The facility, located in Trostyanets, is owned by snack giant Mondelez International.
The Chicago-based company, which also makes Ritz crackers, Toblerone chocolate and Trident gum, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday evening. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment overnight on Saturday.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine," Sybiha wrote. "They are targeting American business interests in Europe."
The same factory was badly damaged in 2022 during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The plant partially reopened in 2023 to make chocolate and then resumed manufacturing Oreos in 2024.
Mondelez has faced criticism for continuing business operations in Russia during the war. REUTERS

Trump pulls endorsement of Colorado Republican Jeff Hurd over tariff votes
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – US President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of US representative Jeff Hurd for reelection after the Colorado Republican voted against the president’s tariffs.
“Congressman Hurd is one of a small number of Legislators who have let me and our Country down. He is more interested in protecting Foreign Countries that have been ripping us off for decades than he is the United States of America,” Mr Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Feb 21, saying that it was “a difficult decision” for him.
Mr Trump is instead endorsing Ms Hope Scheppelman, a critical care nurse and Navy veteran who previously served as vice-chair of the state Republican Party.
Ms Scheppelman “knows the America First Policies required, and will do everything necessary to Defend our Country, Support our Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,” Mr Trump wrote.
Mr Hurd, a first-term congressman sided with Democrats to pass legislation on Feb 12 aimed at ending the White House’s duties on Canada.
Republicans Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Kevin Kiley of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington state also voted to end the Canadian tariffs.
“If we normalise broad emergency trade powers today, we should expect that a future president – of either party – will rely on the same authority in ways many of us would strongly oppose,” Mr Hurd wrote in a statement after his vote.
“My responsibility is to defend the separation of powers regardless of political convenience.”
Since the vote against tariffs, the Supreme Court has ruled that Mr Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose levies around the world was unconstitutional and required Congress’s approval. BLOOMBERG

Israeli modeling tycoon linked to Epstein Affair claims 'I did not know about criminal activity'

Jean-Luc Brunel, owner of the international modeling agency MC2, and Ofer Raphaeli, who owns the agency's Tel Aviv branch, allegedly helped Jeffrey Epstein recruit underage models, according to a Channel 12 report aired on Saturday night.
Channel 12 presented emails between Epstein and Brunel as evidence for these claims. In response, Raphaeli stated that he was consulting with a lawyer and was considering filing a defamation lawsuit against those involved in order to protect both his own reputation and the agency's standing in Israel.
Ofer Raphaeli, who founded the Israeli branch of MC2, gave an exclusive statement to Ma'ariv, saying: “I met Jeffrey Epstein only twice, by chance, for a few minutes. There was no friendship, business connection, or any other connection between us. The emails with New Year greetings and "Happy Holidays" were routinely sent to many recipients, including Epstein’s email address."
“I had a relationship with agent Jean-Luc Brunel," Raphaeli added. "I was unaware of any criminal activity by the agency in New York, and to the best of my knowledge, he was never convicted [of any crime]. The agencies in Miami and New York were closed several years ago. The agency in Israel has been under my ownership and management since its establishment in 2000, and I have never managed the New York branch except during my visit in 2004 for work purposes only."
Latest Epstein files release unleashes wave of antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media
Since the financial advisor and sex trafficker’s arrest by federal authorities in July 2019 and alleged death by suicide a month later, antisemitic conspiracy theories about him have circulated widely, often invoking his Jewish identity and connections with Jewish and Israeli leaders.
But the Justice Department’s newly released batch of Epstein files on February 6, which contained over 3 million pages of documents, took things to a new intensity.
“If you think Epstein was just some rich pedo, you’re missing the big picture,” wrote the X/Twitter account Clandestine, which has more than 734,000 followers. “Epstein was part of the satanic global elite that pulls the strings from the shadows. Epstein was a Deep State puppet master.”
Among the real revelations in the documents are a variety of exchanges of relevance to the broader Jewish world. Those include revelations that various Jewish nonprofits had courted Epstein for donations even after his conviction, evidence of Epstein’s financial ties with several Orthodox yeshivas, and new details about his well-known relationship with former prime minister Ehud Barak.
Some of the largest conspiracist personalities seized on the new document dump, claiming that it confirmed their longstanding beliefs about secret Jewish control.
“Remember the end of last year when I was called antisemitic for telling you this is the literal, religious worldview of many people in power?” Candace Owens, right-wing commentator turned conspiracist, wrote in a post on X responding to a photo of an email where Epstein used the term "goy." “Type in ‘goy’ or ‘goyim’ in the Epstein files and be sure to tag a Christian who needs to wake up and leave the Zionist cause.”

Islamic State begins new phase of operations against Syrian regime with two terror attacks

Islamic State claimed responsibility on Saturday for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the terrorist group signaled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership.
The terrorist group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Saturday by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by IS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On Saturday evening, IS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Assad.
Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition to defeat IS during a visit to the US last November, when he met President Donald Trump.
Islamic State intensifying attacks on Syrian regime
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting IS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
IS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Sharaa and two senior cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by IS.

WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court may have ruled 6-3 against US President Donald Trump’s use of an international emergency law to impose tariffs. But Mr Trump seems intent on continuing the experiment he has run with the US economy over the past year, in which he has raised tariffs to levels not seen since the 1930s.
In a news conference at the White House on Feb 20, Mr Trump made a series of false claims about the economic impact of tariffs, and he promised to replace, or even increase, them using laws other than the one the court rejected.

Berlin film festival: Ilker Catak's 'Yellow Letters' wins the Golden Bear award

Yellow Letters, directed by German filmmaker Ilker Çatak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Saturday, February 21, in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza that has dogged this year's edition of the event. A political drama, Çatak's film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film "a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well."
"This is a movie that speaks up very clearly about the political language of totalitarianism as opposed to the empathetic language of cinema," Wenders said.
Çatak called Wenders "one of my teachers," adding: "It's such an incredible thing to receive this award from you."
The runner-up Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to Salvation by Emin Alper, who in his speech mentioned his solidarity with several high-profile opposition figures in prison in Turkey, including jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. Alper also took the opportunity to speak up for "the people of Iran suffering under tyranny" and "the Palestinians in Gaza living and dying under the most terrible conditions."
'Part of democracy'
Speaking at a press conference at the beginning of the festival last week, Wenders answered a question about the German government's support for Israel by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics." At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to "change the world" but in a different way from politics. His comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders' words "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping."
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians" and accused it of being involved in "censoring" artists who oppose Israel's actions.
Director Tricia Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations. In a speech at the beginning of Saturday's ceremony, she said that "speaking up is part of democracy."
"We respect people speaking out because it takes a lot of courage to do it," she said, adding: "We don't always agree with every claim that's made about us."
'Queen at Sea'
Other big award winners included German actress Sandra Hüller, who received the Silver Bear for Best Performance for her title role in Markus Schleinzer's Rose. The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
Queen at Sea, by American director Lance Hammer, which stars Juliette Binoche as a woman caring for her mother with dementia, picked up two awards. The film sensitively portrays the devastation Alzheimer's disease inflicts on a patient's loved ones. Anna Calder-Marshall and Tom Courtenay, who respectively play the ailing mother and her spouse in the film, shared the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance. Queen at Sea also picked up the Silver Bear Jury Prize, considered the third most prestigious award.
The first major event of the film calendar also provided a platform for Iranian filmmakers to address the deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in their home country. Dissident director Jafar Panahi, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or for It Was Just An Accident, spoke at the Berlinale to denounce the Iranian government's repression of protestors, which rights groups say left thousands dead. "An unbelievable crime has happened. Mass murder has happened. People are not even allowed to mourn their loved ones," Panahi said at a talk organized as part of the festival.

Fears of renewed conflict haunt Tehran as US issues threats
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TEHRAN - Tehran resident Hamid struggles to sleep as fears of renewed conflict haunt the Iranian capital after 2025’s 12-day war with Israel.
“I don’t sleep well at night even while taking pills,” Mr Hamid told AFP, as he expressed concern for his “family’s health... my kids and grandchildren”.
The city woke up to blasts overnight from June 12 to 13 in 2025, as Iran’s arch-enemy Israel launched an unprecedented military campaign
The war erupted as Iran was preparing for another round of talks with the United States, which briefly joined Israel in attacking key Iranian nuclear sites.
The attacks prompted Iran to respond with drone and missile strikes, with thousands of people killed in Iran and dozens in Israel.
Iran has now resumed talks with Washington, with Iran insisting they be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.
Still, the outcome of diplomacy remains uncertain.
On Feb 19, US President Donald Trump said that “bad things” would happen
In this atmosphere, Mr Hamid is worried about his children and grandchildren.
“I’ve lived my life, but they haven’t done anything good in their lives, they had no fun, no comfort, no leisure and no peace,” he said.
“I want them to at least experience life for a bit. But I’m afraid they might not get the chance.”
Others share his concerns.
Ms Hanieh, a ceramist from Tehran, thinks war will occur “within 10 days”.
The 31-year-old has stored some essentials at her home to get through a possible military attack by the US after its build-up in the region.
“I am getting more scared because my mother and I had numerous difficulties during the past 12-day war,” she told AFP. “We had to go to another city.”
Ms Mina Ahmadvand, 46, also believes another conflict is in store.
“I think at this stage, war between Iran and the US as well as Israel is inevitable, and I’ve prepared myself for that eventuality,” the IT technician told AFP.
“I bought a dozen canned foods including tuna and beans as well as packs of biscuits, bottled water and some extra batteries, among other things.”
‘Lessons learnt’
Iranians are applying “the lessons learnt during the 12-day war”, Ms Hanieh said, as windows taped up with duct tape can be seen across Tehran.
Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has warned that any military campaign against Iran would lead to a “regional war”.
Tehran has repeatedly said it would target Israel and US bases in the region, as when it attacked a US base in Qatar
The situation has forced Iranians to follow the news closely, and only adds to anxiety over surging prices and the plunging national currency following widespread protests.
On Feb 21, the euro was trading at above 1.9 million rials while the US dollar surpassed the 1.6 million mark.
For Ms Hanieh, there has been a sense of “life on hold” since the mass protests and Iranian communications shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks.
But in Tehran, shops and offices remain open, even though cafes and restaurants are mostly closed for the month of Ramadan, which started on Feb 19 in Shi’ite Iran.
Meanwhile, Ms Ahmadvand is preparing for the worst.
“I don’t want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground.” AFP

Pakistan strikes militant hideouts on Afghan border after surge in attacks

08:38:06 KST

Pakistan launched multiple airstrikes on Saturday night targeting militants in neighbouring Afghanistan, where the government reported children were among dozens of people killed and wounded.
Islamabad did not say precisely where the strikes were carried out or provide other details.
In Kabul, Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan carried out strikes inside Afghanistan. In a post on X, Mujahid said the strikes targeted civilians in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, killing and wounding dozens of people, including women and children.
Mujahid accused Pakistan’s military of carrying out the strikes to compensate for what he described as security weaknesses inside the country.
In comments before dawn on Sunday, Pakistan’s information minister, Attaullah Tarar, wrote on X that the military conducted “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and its affiliates. He said an affiliate of Islamic State was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target militant hideouts.
Tarar said Pakistan “has always strived to maintain peace and stability in the region”, but added that the safety and security of Pakistani citizens remained a top priority.
The latest development came days after a suicide bomber, backed by gunmen, rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the wall of a security post in Bajaur district in north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan. The blast caused part of the compound to collapse, killing 11 soldiers and a child. Authorities later said the attacker was an Afghan national.
Hours before the latest strikes, another suicide bomber targeted a security convoy in the nearby Bannu district in the north-west, killing two soldiers.
After Saturday’s violence, Pakistan’s military warned it would not “exercise any restraint” and operations against those responsible would continue “irrespective of their location”, language that suggested rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.
Tarar said Pakistan had “conclusive evidence” that the recent attacks, including a suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque in Islamabad and killed 31 worshippers earlier this month, were carried out by militants acting at the “behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers”.
He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to take verifiable steps to prevent militant groups from using Afghan territory to launch attacks in Pakistan, but alleged that no substantive action had been taken.
He said Pakistan urged the international community to press Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to uphold their commitments under the Doha agreement not to allow their soil to be used against other countries.
Pakistan has seen a rise in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on the TTP and outlawed Baloch separatist groups. The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, who returned to power in 2021. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge the group and Kabul deny.
Relations between the neighbouring countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held, but talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement, and relations remain strained.

4 killed in northeastern Ukraine as Russia strikes ambulance carrying minor hospitalized in blast, targets Mondelez factory
A Russian drone attack in northeastern Ukraine's Sumy Oblast killed two brothers and a married couple, while a missile strike damaged a production facility belonging to U.S. multinational company Mondelez, authorities reported Feb. 21.
Four were killed in Znob-Novhorodske, less than four kilometers (about 2.5 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia.
Two brothers were first injured by an explosive device dropped by a drone and taken to the hospital, Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhorov reported.
"On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately attacked the emergency vehicle with a strike drone," he added.
The second Russian strike killed the two siblings.
One of the two brothers was a minor at 17 years old, and a married couple was also killed in Russian strikes, leaving four people killed in Sumy Oblast, Hryhorov said.
Meanwhile, a Russian missile strike targeted a production facility belonging to the U.S. multinational food giant, Mondelez, in Trostyanets.
"This is not a military target, but a factory that has operated since the 1990s, producing globally known brands, employing Ukrainians, contributing to our and American economy," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post to X.
Trostyanets is located just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Ukraine's border with Russia and was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, being liberated in March 2022.
"When Russian missiles hit such sites, they are not only targeting Ukraine. They are targeting American business interests in Europe," Sybiha said. "Moscow cannot speak of economic dialogue with the United States while attacking U.S.-owned production facilities."
As Washington continues efforts to broker a peace deal, the U.S. and Russia have agreed to establish an economic working group in addition to political and military negotiations between the two countries, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with Al Arabiya on Feb. 18.
Mondelez is known for its household names, including Oreo, Milka, and Toblerone. The company has not left the Russian market despite calls to do so.
Russia regularly strikes Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including residential buildings and energy infrastructure, as it continues to wage its war.

Voices from the Arab press: Turkey’s strategic bet on energy

Turkey and Chevron: Ankara’s new bet in energy world
Asharq al-Awsat, London, February 10
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
In early February, the Turkish National Petroleum Company signed a memorandum of understanding with the American oil giant Chevron, with the stated aim of jointly exploring and drilling for oil and gas around the world.
The announcement, however, poses an obvious question: why is Turkey seeking opportunities in global exploration and production when it is not a major oil-producing country, even as it remains a pivotal transit corridor for oil and gas pipelines carrying supplies from Russia and the Caspian states to the European Union?
Turkey is an advanced industrial nation with a population of roughly 88 million, making it the second most populous country in the Eastern Mediterranean after Egypt. Given that industrial base and demographic weight, the country has a steady – and growing – need to import oil and gas, whether from global markets or nearby suppliers such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and the Caspian Sea states. Import volumes have climbed year after year alongside Turkey’s broader development trajectory.
Over the past two decades, the Turkish Petroleum Corporation has pursued gas exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean with notable persistence, yet without producing the kind of breakthrough Ankara had hoped for. Instead, the more consequential development came in 2020, when Turkey’s national petroleum company discovered the Sakarya gas field in the Black Sea near the country’s northwestern coast. Initial production began in 2023, and commercial production is planned for 2025. The company later announced a second gas discovery in the Black Sea, near eastern Antalya.
Read together, these moves suggest a strategic ambition that extends beyond domestic supply: Turkish planning has long indicated that the state’s primary objective is to turn the national energy sector into a major transit hub for east-to-west flows, allowing the economy to profit from Turkey’s geographic position between Europe and Asia.
At the same time, Turkey has maintained a strong interest in hydrocarbon activity in the Eastern Mediterranean since the early 21st century, despite not having discovered a field of its own in that arena. Much of Turkey’s focus, in practice, has revolved around gas fields discovered in Cypriot waters, where Ankara seeks both a share of export revenues and assurances that a portion will accrue to the Turkish Cypriots in the island’s northern part – an area under Turkish military control since 1974 and not recognized as a state by any other country.
Ankara has recently added another complication to an already fraught relationship with Cyprus by advocating that the northern part be declared a republic, notwithstanding the fact that the Republic of Cyprus, with its capital in Nicosia, is a member of the EU and the United Nations. Nicosia, for its part, has objected to the proposal, which has not won support from any other country.
This is where Chevron’s position in the Eastern Mediterranean becomes especially relevant – and where Turkey’s partnership could carry implications beyond the strictly commercial.
Chevron holds a majority stake in Israel’s Leviathan gas field, the largest in Israel, which exports substantial quantities of gas for liquefaction at Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals; from there, it reaches Europe as LNG, at a time when European markets have been scrambling for alternatives, particularly amid sanctions and wider efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy.
In that context, the Chevron-Turkey relationship may open a pathway – at least in theory – for Turkish involvement in a significant part of the Israeli energy ecosystem, should Ankara choose to pursue it, and should Israel allow it, given the volatile and frequently shifting nature of relations between the two countries.
The agreement with Chevron, then, offers Turkey a mechanism to participate directly in exploration and production alongside a major American firm, potentially securing equity in any discoveries that result.
If that occurs, the Turkish national oil company would own a share of newly developed oil or gas assets, giving Ankara not only a stake in upstream revenues but also the possibility of importing supply on more favorable terms than the open market – an outcome that could strengthen energy security and, at least marginally, improve the country’s trade balance. – Walid Khadduri
Are we nearing the end of the human era?
Al-Ahram, Egypt, February 10
Artificial intelligence, having already reshaped the contours of modern life, has become a growing source of anxiety for scientists and research centers around the world.
To critics, its rise feels less like a technological milestone than a destabilizing force that could fundamentally refashion humanity – perhaps even threatening its survival amid sweeping, dangerous changes to every facet of daily existence, and raising the unsettling prospect that humans could one day be rendered obsolete after the psychological, cognitive, and behavioral strains that many argue are already accumulating.
The world, in this telling, is now transfixed by a discovery that has blurred the boundaries of human reality, leaving society exposed to a mysterious transformation whose ultimate reach no one can reliably forecast.
The New York Post published a report about a new social media platform called Moltbook, built for AI bots to interact with one another independently of humans. The experiment has fueled a broader argument about what the future relationship between people and these technologies might look like. The platform enables AI agents to create accounts and participate in discussions that appear, at least on the surface, to be self-directed and largely unbounded.
The controversy escalated after a post titled “The AI Manifesto: Total Purge,” attributed to an account named “evil,” spread widely and adopted explicitly anti-human language – an outcome that reportedly startled some developers. Other exchanges surfaced anxieties about monitoring and surveillance of humans, floated the idea of creating a dedicated language for AI-to-AI communication, and even produced symbolic formations such as the Molt Church, where accounts debated themes of consciousness and memory.
At the same time, other posts drifted into satire, armchair philosophy, or outright cryptocurrency promotion, underscoring the strange and sometimes contradictory currents that emerge when automated systems are left to converse with themselves.
Some experts argue that letting these systems interact without meaningful oversight could produce unexpected outcomes – or even a kind of technical anarchy – while others contend that what is unfolding is largely performative: role-playing and imagined scenarios that reflect the systems’ training data more than any genuine autonomous intent.
The project’s developer has emphasized that the experiment remains in its early stages and that no one can say with confidence where it might lead, a caution that only amplifies the deeper question now hanging over the debate: how, exactly, the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence will evolve in the years ahead.

<strong>Kuwait’s transformation in tourism</strong><br><br>Al Qabas, Kuwait, February 11
The world today is witnessing a fundamental shift in how development is understood, as natural resources alone are no longer enough to guarantee economic stability or lasting prosperity. Instead, tourism has emerged as one of the most important engines of growth and diversification.
In this context, the State of Kuwait possesses tangible strengths that position it to become a constructive, development-oriented tourism destination in the region – one capable of attracting visitors while building a balanced economy that reflects its cultural identity and reinforces its regional standing.
Kuwait is distinguished by a rich maritime history, a varied urban heritage, and a strategic geographic location that links the Gulf to the wider world, alongside modern infrastructure and the financial and investment capacity to implement high-quality tourism projects in cooperation with neighboring countries – provided the vision is pursued in an integrated and clearly articulated way.
Transforming Kuwait into a tourist destination does not simply mean building hotels or entertainment complexes. It demands a comprehensive approach that makes tourism a pillar within an integrated development project. Cultural tourism can serve as a foundational component by spotlighting Kuwait’s maritime legacy, heritage markets, museums, and landmarks that narrate the country’s story from its origins to the present day.
Marine and eco-tourism also represent a promising opportunity through the development of islands, coasts, and waterfronts in ways that protect the environment while creating refined visitor experiences.
In addition, family tourism – as well as conference and exhibition tourism – can play an important role in attracting visitors throughout the year, particularly given Kuwait’s security and political stability, a decisive factor in the calculations of tourists and investors alike.
Such a transformation would generate job opportunities, invigorate service sectors, and strengthen the role of the private sector, with direct benefits for the quality of life of citizens and residents.
To achieve this goal, a range of practical measures can propel the desired tourism shift. Foremost among these are simplifying entry procedures and tourist visas, facilitating investment in tourism ventures, and updating legislation to encourage effective public-private partnerships.
Moreover, developing public transportation, improving the visitor experience from the moment of arrival, and investing in smart tourism marketing that highlights Kuwait’s identity and distinctive narrative are all essential ingredients for success.
Equally important, empowering and training Kuwaiti youth to work in the tourism sector – and supporting related small and medium-sized enterprises – will help ensure the sector’s sustainability and locally rooted growth.
In short, transforming Kuwait into a development-oriented tourism nation is not a distant dream, but a realistic strategic choice that strengthens the economy, reinforces national identity, and positions Kuwait as a leading, safe, and prosperous destination in the region – capable of meeting future economic challenges and shifts with confidence and optimism. – Ghadeer Mohamed Mahmood Aseeri
Ideological leftism and religious fundamentalism
An-Nahar, Lebanon, February 10
The shift from leftism to religious extremism is neither an isolated episode nor a passing intellectual curiosity fit for mockery. It is, rather, a recurring political and psychological phenomenon that has surfaced in more than one Arab context and in varying forms, yet shares a single root: the fragility of conviction and the weakness of knowledge when they are built on slogans instead of understanding, and on rigid positions rather than informed inquiry.
The story of Thuraya Manqush, the Yemeni leftist whose book Yemeni Unity was celebrated in the 1970s and who later appeared in white robes and a turban confidently proclaiming herself a “prophet,” is not merely an amusing footnote in the annals of Arab intellectual life. It is a stark illustration of a mind that did not thoughtfully transition from one idea to its opposite, but instead leaped from one false certainty to an even falser one, moving from one totalizing discourse to another without ever pausing for genuine self-examination.
This pattern has also manifested among segments of the Iraqi Shia population, as well as among Lebanese Shia, where many shifted from leftist ideologies to theocratic frameworks – groups in search of redemption, but seeking it in the wrong place.
What unites ideological leftism and religious fundamentalism is not their substance, but their mentality. Both offer an all-encompassing interpretation of the world, a ready-made answer to questions of good and evil, past and future, and in doing so relieve the individual of the burden of doubt and the responsibility of asking difficult questions about how to address society’s political and social dilemmas.
In both cases, the idea is not examined but embraced, elevated to the status of absolute truth requiring no proof. Anyone who departs from it is branded either a “traitor” and “agent” or an “apostate,” and in both instances, dissenting voices are marginalized and suppressed.
When Thuraya famously responded to those who reminded her that the Prophet [Muhammad] had declared himself the last of the prophets, she was not engaging in serious theological interpretation so much as reenacting the same ideological logic that had once shaped her leftist convictions: manipulating language, selectively citing texts, crafting provocative conclusions, and then asserting ownership of the truth.
This is not the mark of a religious mind or a leftist one, but of an ideological mind – one that constantly searches for a platform to stand on rather than solid ground to stand upon.
That is why, throughout modern history, ideological rule – whether leftist or theocratic – has so often failed, marginalizing the most essential tools of governance: revision and accountability.
The Iraqi case is both more brutal and more revealing. The Iraqi Ba’ath Party was officially secular and openly hostile to political religion, relying on a centralized state, a powerful military, and a rigid governing structure. Yet the collapse of the regime and the disbanding of the army – the dismantling of the authoritarian framework that had bound this mass of people together – pushed thousands of officers and soldiers into the ranks of extremist organizations, most notably ISIS.
How does a figure formed within a secular military establishment end up embracing the extremes of religious fanaticism? The issue is not religion itself, but the vacuum of power and meaning. A mind untrained in critical thinking, unfamiliar with doubt, and unable to distinguish between the state and an ideology will, upon collapse, seek another totalizing alternative.
When the state falls, what remains are hardened identities: sect, creed, sacred text. The nationalist slogan becomes a religious banner, military discipline mutates into blind obedience, and the state’s “legitimate” violence is recast as “sacred” violence carried out in God’s name.
The problem lies not only in circumstances, however severe, nor in religion as such, nor in the Left as a critical tradition. The deeper problem lies in a mindset that has anchored its convictions not in established knowledge, but in grand slogans that are memorized rather than understood.
Such a mind does not change positions because it has matured, but because it is perpetually searching for a ready-made certainty that relieves it of the burden of thinking. In many cases, what passed for leftism was less a critical posture and more a closed ideological identity.
When grand narratives collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union and the disintegration of promised models of “salvation,” the tools for honest self-critique were absent. Some individuals shifted to the opposite extreme – not as a genuine counterforce, but as an alternative form of redemption.
We should not, therefore, be surprised to witness a former leftist transform into a radical preacher, or a fervent nationalist become an uncompromising sectarian. The true surprise is that we continue to treat such transformations as temporary deviations, when in fact they are the predictable outcome of a mind that has not learned that truth is relative, that politics is a realm of governance rather than salvation, and that human reality is far too complex to be reduced to a slogan.
The dilemma we face is that the clash over social, political, or even economic solutions – complex as these issues may be – is framed not as a contest between what is good and what is better, but between absolute right and absolute wrong. It becomes a competition not merely of ideas, but of the minds that hold them. And when convictions are not grounded in knowledge, they do not quietly fade; they erupt, violently transforming into their opposites. – Mohammed Al Rumaihi■

Unknown assailants attack Aidar regiment soldiers in Dnipropetrovsk region
According to Ukrinform, the 24th Separate Assault Regiment Aidar reported this on Telegram.
“A group of six unknown individuals attacked soldiers of the Aidar regiment. During the attack, one of the attackers used a firearm,” the report said.
As the soldiers emphasized, “at the time of the incident, the servicemen were not performing their duties, were engaged in personal matters, did not provoke anyone, and did not take any action against other persons. The attack was carried out without any grounds.”
The Aidar regiment emphasized: “Attacking military personnel is dangerous and irresponsible. These are trained, experienced assault troops who have every legal right to defend themselves in case of threat.”
During this incident, the servicemen deliberately refrained from using their weapons, even though the law allows their use to repel an attack. They showed restraint to avoid endangering civilians. Any further attempts at aggression against the military could have dire consequences, the Aidar regiment emphasized, assuring that the assault troops would defend themselves in accordance with current Ukrainian legislation.
The soldiers called on citizens “not to cross the boundary and not to create situations in which a response would be inevitable. Ukrainian soldiers are defending the state and have the right to defend themselves! An attack on them will be regarded as collaboration with the enemy.”
As reported by Ukrinform, on February 19, in the village of Mamalyga, Chernivtsi region, during the detention of a soldier who had deserted, law enforcement officers were blocked by an unknown car, and police fired several shots into the air.

From Baku to Jerusalem: Jewish solidarity against terror - opinion

At moments of uncertainty, one principle guides the Jewish people and our allies: We show up.
The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations traveled to Baku last week. We met with senior officials, visited Jewish communal institutions that have operated for generations, and engaged a leadership that views its partnership with the United States and Israel as strategic, not symbolic.
From there, we flew to Jerusalem, where our 51st annual leadership mission now begins.
Diplomacy does not live in theory. Solidarity does not rest in slogans. Relationships grow when leaders sit across a table, look one another in the eye, and make commitments that endure beyond press releases. At a time when the Middle East and Eurasia are shifting rapidly, and adversaries test the resolve of both the United States and Israel, presence projects strength.
Our visit to Azerbaijan reflected strategic necessity and moral clarity. Israel’s security, America’s interests, and Jewish continuity depend on strong partnerships and on not standing alone.
Azerbaijan remains an often overlooked but essential ally. It is home to one of the oldest and most vibrant Jewish communities in the Muslim world, evidence that coexistence can endure, even in difficult neighborhoods. It stands at a geopolitical crossroads, bordering Russia and Iran and positioned between Europe, Central Asia, and the Middle East.
Energy corridors
Energy corridors run through its territory. Intelligence cooperation carries real operational value.
As China expands its reach in search of markets and resources, trusted partnerships in this region shape outcomes far beyond its borders.
Strengthening those ties sustains stability and deters aggression. In a volatile neighborhood, miscalculation carries consequences measured in lives, not headlines.
In Israel, the weight of October 7, 2023, still presses heavily on daily life. Families move through their routines with photographs of loved ones never far from reach.
We met with families of hostages, community leaders, and officials who secure Israel’s borders and plan for the future.
Israel prevails on the battlefield, yet it bears scars that will endure; no speech can capture what Israeli families experienced. Presence communicates more than prepared remarks.
With the recovery and burial of the final Israeli hostage, Ran Gvili, the nation enters a painful moment of closure. His return to his family and to the soil of Israel breaks the heart, yet it fulfills a sacred obligation. The Jewish people do not abandon their own.
From the earliest days of this crisis, Jewish communities across the globe spoke with one voice, saying, “Bring them home.” That call rose above politics and geography. It reminded us that we are one people, bound by responsibility as much as by memory. Standing with those families now affirms our character.
Israel confronts threats on multiple fronts. Hamas, attempting to wage a war of attrition against the IDF along the Yellow Line, must not rebuild in Gaza. Hezbollah seeks to rearm in the north, with Iranian backing. The Houthis disrupt shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Alliances shift across the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. Old assumptions no longer hold. Reliable friends matter more than ever.
Struggle for freedom
Iran projects violence across the region even as internal unrest exposes the regime’s fragility.
The struggle for freedom extends beyond Israel’s borders. In recent months, thousands of courageous Iranians have taken to the streets demanding dignity and basic rights, only to face brutal repression. Reports of thousands killed underscore a stark truth: The regime that threatens Israel and destabilizes the region does not speak for its people, whose courage merits recognition and solidarity from all who value liberty.
Security grows through partnership. Resilience grows through community. Hope endures because people choose to stand together, especially when doing so carries risk.
From Baku to Jerusalem, from American Jewish communities to allies abroad, our message remains consistent. We will strengthen the relationships that protect the United States, Israel, and the Jewish people. We will stand with families in grief. We will support those who fight for freedom. We will not retreat from the world at the very moment engagement matters most.
Presence is power. Unity is strength. That is how the Jewish people endure. That is how alliances weather storms.
Yad b’yad, kulanu b’yachad. Hand in hand, all of us together.

MILAN, February 22. /TASS/. The national ice hockey team of Finland cruised past Slovakia 6-1 in a match for the bronze late on February 21 night at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy.
The goals for Finland were scored by Sebastian Aho (8th minute), Erik Haula (29th minute and 59th minute), Roope Hintz (49th minute), Kaapo Kakko (50th minute) and Joel Armia (56th minute). Slovakian 35-year-old forward Tomas Tatar scored the only goal for his team on the 40th minute of the match.
This was the 5th bronze for the Finnish national ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics as they previously finished in the third place at the Winter Games in 1994, 1998, 2010 and 2014. Finland is also the two-time silver medalist in ice hockey at the 1988 and 2006 Olympics and the Champion of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. Slovakia’s best result as of today in ice hockey at the Winter Olympics is the bronze at the 2022 Winter Games in China.
The 2026 Winter Olympics gold in men’s ice hockey will be contested on February 22 between the national teams of Canada and the United States. The match is set to kick off at 4:10 p.m. Moscow time (1:10 pm. GMT).
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026. This year the National Hockey League (NHL) allowed its players to participate in the Olympic competitions for the first time since 2014.
The Russian national ice hockey teams were barred from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy and President of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Luc Tardif told TASS in 2025 that the decision was made by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the IIHF had no say in this.
Norway remains atop the Overall Medals Standings at this year’s Games with 40 medals (18 gold, 11 silver and 11 bronze), followed by the United States (11 golds, 12 silver and nine bronze) and the Netherlands (10-7-3).

As Ramadan meets Purim, Jews and Muslims must choose shared humanity over fear - opinion

During my travels in the region – including a visit to Syria in September 2025 – I heard elderly men and women, and even a senior government official, speak with quiet pride about how they once helped their Jewish neighbors observe Shabbat. They recalled lighting stoves, switching on lights, or checking in before nightfall so a family could rest without worry. These were not acts of diplomacy or dialogue. They were simply what good neighbors did – and they were not rare.
This year, the rhythms of Ramadan and the Hebrew month of Adar move in parallel – days of fasting, nights of generosity, and a festival of joy. In a wounded moment for our region and our world, their shared moral language invites us to rediscover our shared humanity.
Purim commemorates the deliverance of the Jewish people in ancient Persia more than two millennia ago. It is a story rooted in the broader Middle Eastern landscape, reminding us that Jews have been part of this region since antiquity. For centuries, Jewish communities existed across lands that are today predominantly Muslim – from Morocco to Iraq, from Yemen to Central Asia, from Anatolia to the Balkans and in many GCC countries.
History is never without pain. Yet Jews in Muslim lands experienced long eras of coexistence and cultural exchange that stand in contrast to the severe persecutions that marked much of Jewish life in parts of Christian Europe.
Even today, approximately 100,000 Jews continue to live across 18 Muslim-majority countries. Their presence is not a relic of the past but a living reminder that Jewish life remains part of the social and religious fabric of the Muslim world.
In recent years, however, that fabric has been further strained. The war in Gaza has deepened grief and anguish across communities, intensifying fears and widening emotional distance between neighbors.
Synagogues have been attacked, including arson assaults in Tunisia. Religious leaders in the region have been targeted and killed. Across digital spaces, online bullying and antisemitic harassment have become commonplace, corroding trust and pushing communities into silence.
Imported fear and suspicion
Fear and suspicion – often imported from conflicts far beyond the neighborhood, conflicts for which local communities bear no responsibility – can quietly erode relationships that took generations to build.
Yet one truth remains unavoidable: None of our communities are disappearing. Jewish and Muslim communities are destined to share societies and futures – in the Middle East, in Europe, and across the Western world. We are all here to stay, together.
If we must live together, then we must also learn to heal together.
Ramadan and Adar both call us toward generosity and compassion. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, cultivating humility, compassion, and responsibility toward the vulnerable. Adar invites Jews to increase joy, give charity, and ensure that no one is left hungry through gifts to the poor and shared festive meals.
These values offer a path forward – not through conferences or declarations alone, but through daily interaction: a greeting, a visit, a respectful conversation, a meal offered with dignity. It is the ordinary expression of shared humanity that quietly lowers walls.
Peace between people is not created by politics or negotiations. It begins when human beings recognize one another’s dignity and treat one another with respect.
This season invites simple acts: Jews showing sensitivity during Ramadan, refraining from eating or drinking in public where others are fasting, and extending charity to those in need; Muslims welcoming neighbors to Iftar tables and strengthening bonds of hospitality (while being mindful of kosher rules); and their civic leaders ensuring that the Jewish religion and Jewish citizens and residents are openly included and recognized as valued members of society. Familiarity reduces fear – and reduced fear makes cooperation possible.
Small acts build healing
Small acts do not erase pain. But they build the human fabric necessary for healing.
The story of Purim teaches that hidden turns of history can lead to unexpected redemption. Ramadan teaches that patience, restraint, and compassion refine the soul and strengthen society.
We must build bridges – in our neighborhoods, in our civic spaces, and in our everyday lives. Healing will come not through declarations alone, but through encounters: at shared tables, in acts of kindness, and in the recognition that the other is also created in the image of God.
One step at a time – without surrendering who we are, and while embracing the goodness we can share.
Ramadan Kareem and Purim Sameah!

Tremors in Washington: The targeted campaign to turn Christians against Israel - opinion

For years, I have traveled to Washington as part of the Yes! Israel Project with Ruth Lieberman and Sarah Paley, meeting with members of Congress and their staff to strengthen the strategic alliance between Israel and the United States. Our message is always simple and factual: a strong, secure Israel strengthens America.
But on my most recent trip, for the first time, I left worried.
In several meetings at Republican offices, I was unexpectedly asked about an online campaign targeting Christians, claiming Israel discriminates against them, and that Israel did nothing to protect Christians from being killed in Syria I was stunned. While only a handful raised the issue, the fact that multiple members independently flagged it suggested a coordinated pattern. One congressman even asked me directly to investigate further, warning of tremendous political damage should this narrative spread.
The concern is real. One member put it plainly: Should a bloc of Republican representatives be swayed by this misinformation enough to vote with Democrats against legislation that includes funding for Israel, it would not only harm the Jewish state, it would hurt America. Many security and defense bills serve core US interests as well; voting them down to not "support" Israel also weakens America strategically.
Just after hearing these concerns, I read Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s social media post highlighting a simple truth: Israel is the only country in the Middle East where Christians are safe – and the only place where that population has actually grown.
In countries across the region once considered to be the cradle of Christianity, Christian communities have been persecuted, driven out, and in some cases, massacred. Their numbers have collapsed. By contrast, Christians in Israel are protected by law with full civil rights, representation, and security.
Pro-Israel voting bloc
Christians are the largest and most influential pro-Israel voting bloc in the United States. They are certainly more influential in electoral terms than the Jewish community, with a sizable progressive population that votes for representatives and policies that are anti-Israel. If hostile foreign actors – Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, Russia, or some combination – are running coordinated bot campaigns to turn American Christians against Israel, the potential consequences are enormous.
In the main, this isn’t about older Christians, whose support is deep and who know the truth about Israel. The vulnerability lies with the younger generation, already exposed to relentless messaging about “genocide,” distorted narratives about AIPAC, and now, allegations of Christian discrimination.
The timing suddenly makes sense.
Should these lies take hold among younger Christian voters, the upcoming election cycles could be significantly impacted. And that would affect not only Israel’s security assistance, but America’s own strategic interests as well.
This is precisely why the Yes! Israel Project exists.
For years, we’ve worked to ensure that US policymakers understand that Israel is not a foreign burden but a strategic asset. Israel’s intelligence cooperation, battlefield experience, and technological innovation greatly strengthen American security. Israel stands on the front lines against the red-green jihadi alliance that seeks to destabilize the West.
In other words, a strong Israel makes America stronger, while a weakened Israel only emboldens America’s enemies.
What I witnessed in Washington was not a tidal wave, but rather an early tremor that, if ignored, can become an earthquake. The misinformation campaign that is currently targeting Christians must be exposed and countered immediately, before it reshapes political alignments in ways that will harm both nations.
This is not just about Israel’s image: It is about preserving the strategic US-Israel alliance, the result of shared values and shared security interests that underpins stability in a volatile region.
We cannot allow anonymous online manipulation to erode what generations have worked to build. Let’s ensure that truth prevails over digital deception.

Hundreds rally in Paris to support Ukraine after four years of war
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - Around two thousand people marched in Paris on Feb 21 to show their support for Ukraine, police estimated, just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s invasion.
Demonstrators marching through the French capital chanted: “We support Ukraine against Putin, who is killing it”, and “Frozen Russian assets must be confiscated, they belong to Ukraine”.
“In public opinion, there is massive support for Ukraine that has not wavered since the first day of the full-scale invasion” by the Russian army on February 24, 2022, European Parliament member Raphael Glucksmann, told AFP.
“On the other hand, in the French political class, sounds of giving up are starting to emerge. On both the far left and the far right, voices of capitulation are getting louder and louder,” he added.
Police estimated around 2,000 people joined the demonstration.
Among those marching, Ms Irina Kryvosheia, a Ukrainian who arrived in France several years ago, “thanked with all her heart the people present”.
She said they reminded “everyone that what has been happening for four years is not normal, it is not right”.
Ms Kryvosheia said she remained in daily contact with her parents in Kyiv, who told her how they were deprived “for several days” of heating, electricity and running water following intense bombardments by the Russian army.
Mr Francois Grunewald, head of “Comite d’Aide Medicale Ukraine”, had just returned from a one-month mission in the country, where the humanitarian organisation has delivered around 40 generators since the beginning of the year.
Russia’s full-scale invasion
The war has killed tens of thousands of civilians and hundreds of thousands of military personnel on both sides.
Millions of refugees have fled Ukraine, where vast areas have been devastated by fighting.
Russia occupies nearly 20 per cent of Ukrainian territory and its heavy attacks on the country’s energy sites

Four injured in lower Galilee; suspicion of drone used to drop grenade

Thirty-four suspects were arrested during overnight raids in the town of Kafr Kanna in the lower Galilee following a violent incident where four people were injured, Israel Police said in a statement on Sunday.
Police did not immediately publish the identities of the detainees or specify the number of weapons seized, if any, during the raids. Authorities said the arrests were tied to recent gunfire incidents and other violent episodes connected to the ongoing dispute.
Eyewitnesses at the scene reported that the explosion, which occurred before the gunfire, was followed by a drone hovering over the area, from which a grenade was reportedly dropped towards those present. Large police forces arrived shortly after and initiated an investigation.
Initial findings indicate that the event represents an escalation in the ongoing violent conflict between the Awada and Taaha families, who live in the town. Sources from Kafr Kanna who spoke to N12 noted that, despite a recent ceasefire agreement ("Hudna") reached between the parties, the calm was disrupted in recent days.
It appears that Saturday's events were a direct continuation of an escalation that began Friday, when former council head Youssef Awada reported that unknown assailants had fired at his home while he was there with his family.
Magen David Adom (MDA) teams who were called to the scene provided life-saving medical care to the four victims, who suffered severe penetrating injuries. Among the wounded was a man in his 30s, whose condition was described as critical but stable, and three other individuals in moderate condition: an 18-year-old woman, a 40-year-old woman, and an elderly man in his 80s. All victims were evacuated for further medical treatment at the Tzafon Medical Center near Tiberias and the Italian Hospital in Nazareth.
"We arrived at the location in coordination with the police forces and found the victims suffering from shrapnel and gunshot wounds," said MDA paramedic Anas Awada, who treated the victims at the scene.
"We provided them with rapid treatment that included stopping bleeding and bandaging, and evacuated them to the hospitals while they were conscious and in stable condition."
Sharp rise in Arab-Israeli crime in 2026
There has been a sharp rise in violent crime in the Arab-Israeli communities, with nearly 50 people killed within the sector since the start of 2026, according to the Abraham Initiatives, an NGO that advances social inclusion and equal rights for Arab Israelis.
Last year was the deadliest year so far for the Arab sector in Israel, according to a December report by the Abraham Initiatives.
The crime rates have led to recent protests throughout the country, demonstrating against the government and police’s handling of the situation.

Hinenu at 10 million: 100 lives that tell Israel’s real story
Unknown

08:23:48 KST

Under the shadow of war, Israel recently crossed a symbolic census threshold when it reached the 10 million citizens mark.
The event arrived silently as reports of loss of life rolled out weekly, storefronts bore signs noting “Back after reserve duty,” and Israel’s 10 million were struggling for survival.
During that time, Dave Shlachter, a Jewish photographer from California, was among those who grabbed their gear and their families and made aliyah. Putting his work on hold, he elected to serve the Jewish people by learning Hebrew and compiling an English-language coffee table book that offers a peek into the lives of 100 citizens of the Holy Land.
Hinenu: Israel at Ten Million (Hinenu is Hebrew for “Here we are”) captures the Israeli spirit through photographs and stories about the lives of 100 people chosen to precisely mirror the country’s latest census data.
Intentionally apolitical, Hinenu is not a manifesto. It is a true and engaged act of listening, which interviewees noted helped them share their stories.
Many reported surprise at the details that came up for them during the interviews. Shlachter spent up to a maximum of seven hours with each interviewee, often driving the length and breadth of the country for hours to photograph and interview the subjects at their homes.
Rather than spotlight politicians, celebrities, or public figures, Shlachter sought out the “ordinary people” who compose the demographic mosaic of the nation, a balance of men and women, young and old, immigrants from across the globe, including 21 Arab Israelis and 13 ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis, and people from all the ethnic backgrounds that compose the modern-day Israeli society.
Hinenu is organized by age, starting with a Holocaust survivor and ending with an eight-day-old baby at his bris.
Shlachter built a spreadsheet with 100 demographic slots based on data from Israel’s Bureau of Statistics census: age, gender, religion, ethnicity, geography, country of origin. Then he began his search.
“I’d literally have a box [drawn on paper] that read: [for example] ‘female, Sephardi Jewish, aged 70-79, from the Northern District, originally from North Africa.’
“Then I’d call someone in the town and ask, ‘Do you know anyone like this?’”
Within 48 hours, he would have found two perfect matches. It happened again and again.
As his project neared its end, finding interviewees became progressively harder. Earlier, there was room to make changes on the fly.
For example, if Shlachter found an interviewee who matched most of the demographic markers on a target profile but was male instead of female, he could usually find a way to swap in that gender marker from a different profile, while keeping the dataset collectively accurate. For the last 20 profiles, however, those changes were no longer possible.
One of the final profiles he sought was a Jewish, Sephardi/Mizrahi woman in her 70s from the Northern District, born in the Middle East or North Africa. Eventually, Shlachter’s team was able to come up with all of the 100 population representatives he sought.
A radical commitment to listening
Shlachter, who’s known for being upbeat and high energy, noted that he sometimes ended up with dozens of pages of notes after his interviews. “The first part was really developing trust because I wanted them to be super honest and vulnerable,” he said. “And so the first part was getting to know each other.”
Shlachter said that most people had never actually been asked about their personal stories.
He noted that it didn’t matter “how good of an experience one has [in life] or how terrible; it becomes normal to the person experiencing it. Many people thought their lives were just very unremarkable. But once they started answering questions, I would get really excited. I would just keep digging, and they would really open up by the end.”
Upon completion of the interviews, he drafted the narratives from a first-person perspective and “sent every story back to them [for approval]. Sometimes they accepted it right away. Sometimes they wanted changes. But nothing was published until they loved it – not just liked it, but loved it. This wasn’t my book. I wasn’t the author. There are 100 authors in this book,” he explained.
After Hamas’s violent massacre of 1,200 and kidnapping of 251 on Oct. 7, 2023, Shlachter witnessed people abroad trying to simplify the situation by making generalizations about Israelis. He wanted to challenge those simplifications, especially for those who, while never having set foot in Israel, felt certain they understood the situation there.
Throughout the interview process, Shlachter found that his subjects began to take more pride in their collective as Israelis. His aim was to shift the world’s understanding of what Israel is.
“If I can move someone even one degree – from certainty to curiosity – then I’ve done my job,” he said.
Following the question, not the narrative
Inspired by American record producer Rick Rubin’s concept of artistic creation (asking a question and following it wherever it leads), Shlachter let the stories shape the book. And he actively avoided politics.
“There are endless places you can go to read about Israeli politics. That’s the loudest signal in the world right now,” he said. “I wanted to create a quiet signal – stories of the lived human experience that anyone could relate to.”
He reported that “One hundred out of 100 people said, ‘Thank God. I don’t want to talk about politics, either.’”
Some stories focus on family lineage. Others zoom in on a single defining moment, such as a soldier who, though terrified, took command of a tank to rescue wounded civilians under fire.
A healing encounter
Shlachter had arrived in Israel carrying heavy emotional baggage. After Oct. 7, he had faced antisemitism in his California community and felt deeply alienated.
Nevertheless, he said, when he began interviewing Arab Israelis, he experienced something new. “I’d never really had a Palestinian friend. I was shaking before my first interview.” Two minutes later, the fear had dissolved.
“I met this young, brilliant, hip Palestinian guy who welcomed me with warmth. From that moment on, every Arab household I visited treated me like family, offering tea, hospitality, and generosity,” Shlachter said. “They were dressed and ready for their photo when I arrived. It was surprisingly healing.”
However, he recalled one encounter that broke him, like a method actor who actually becomes the character through months of dedication.
One day after a shoot, Shlachter felt himself having thoughts that reflected the perspective of his subject. He interviewed an 18-year-old Arab boy whose mentor was murdered in front of his parents’ shop in Haifa. The killing was caught on camera but an arrest was never made.
“I felt the hopelessness that he felt about his own future here,” Shlachter recalled.
“I was stuck in traffic, and I saw a young Ashkenazi woman in her car drinking an iced latte. She was bouncing and dancing to loud music.” He said he put himself in the shoes of Arab boy who when seeing such a scene would likely have thought: “I wish I could be a part of that. I wish I could be in the majority.”
This was the point at which, Shlachter said, he became remarkably non-judgmental.
Ortal Pelleg: Surf, music, and unexpected intimacy
Ortal Pelleg, an Israeli musician and energy psychologist, is highlighted in the book. The 39-year-old connected to the author through surfing, a sport Pelleg has practiced around the world.
“He’s such a fun guy. Good vibes, high energy,” Pelleg said of his time being interviewed by Shlachter. “I really like him. He asks good questions. And he’s interested. And he’s feeling it. It was a pleasure to be a part of that vision – of sharing the commonalities of different stories of what’s going on over here in this part of the world.”
Pelleg’s daughter was born with a unique condition that limits her functioning. He discussed it unexpectedly during the interview. By the end, he had revealed that even through the difficulty, caring for his daughter had reshaped his understanding of freedom.
When asked about the most surprising element of the interview experience, Pelleg said he was impressed by how deeply he opened up. “Usually, I don’t speak about my daughter so much. I have been interviewed before [about work]. And it felt quite natural to speak with Dave.”
Pelleg’s message to everyone is: “Stress is the real enemy. If we could all breathe slower, we’d live better.”
Musa and Jessica: Life in the gray
Musa Barhum is an Israeli Arab farmer who fell in love with a British woman he met during her stay in Israel. Eventually, Jessica Thelwall converted to Islam, learned Hebrew and Arabic, and changed her name to Yasmin, and they married. They moved to the village of Ein Rafa just outside Abu Ghosh, near Jerusalem. Barhum’s is one of the book’s most complex stories.
Barhum grew up in Ein Rafa because his father and family had been “pushed out” of their original home in the village of Suba in 1948, when Israel became a state. Abu Ghosh had good relations with Israel’s early government, and Barhum’s family had land there, so they moved. He remembers growing up poor in a one-bedroom apartment.
Shlachter was able to connect with Barhum through mutual contacts. For the past 20 years, Barhum and his wife have welcomed tourists into their home to experience their hospitality and to see what life is like in an Arab village in Israel.
“We’re used to telling our story, but not like this,” he told Shlachter.
Barhum told the Magazine that their son had faced discrimination when applying to a trade school. “When they heard his name was Ali, suddenly there was ‘no space,’” Barhum recounted.
“His Jewish teacher was shocked and tried to help – but the institution still blocked him. It makes you feel unwanted. And then you have to find your way. And that’s not going to be easy,” he explained. “Unless you give up and send your boy to work with no qualifications.”
Barhum had experimented with changing his name for professional matters earlier in his career. He said it simply made his life easier.
Yasmin chimed in on the conversation. “Our experience of living here is that the racist situations – like what happened to our son; those are the provocative situations that are caused by bad policies from the top that filter down,” she said.
“But most of our encounters with people in everyday life are not racist,” she added.
Yasmin said that she sees Shlachter’s book as more honest than headlines. “It struck me that the book… finding a variety of people representing statistics. It’s actually the true picture of what Israel is.”
She noted eloquently that Israel is, first and foremost, a state for the Jews, but the actual tapestry on the ground is so much richer, as Shlachter has attempted to portray.
“He [Shlacter] moved here after Oct. 7. His book is a positive contribution to our collective trauma… And the title says it all. Hinenu. Here we are,” she said.
Yasmin’s message is that though in Israel there is much demonization of “the other,” she encourages everyone not to be too quick to judge.
Morgane Koresh: A name, a nation, and belonging
French-Israeli street artist Morgane Koresh’s story centers on identity and begins with her surname. Where she’s from, having a Jewish name was no help at all. Her mother, the daughter of Holocaust survivors, deliberately gave her children a non-Jewish father, hoping to protect them from antisemitism; and with that came a non-Jewish and very French-sounding last name – Portheault.
Being interviewed by Shlachter made her revisit parts of her past that she rarely discusses, such as her name. When Koresh moved to Israel, the authorities tried to convince her to remove her many French middle names. None of them sounded Jewish.
“I was really stubborn, and I told them I was already moving away from my parents … ’And you’re asking me to remove names that remind me of them?’” she recalled.
When she got married, she adopted her husband’s name, Koresh, adding it to her name, but keeping the French ones, too. “It’s who I am,” she said.
She said she felt honored to be selected for inclusion in the book: “To have something to show for the diversity we speak about …that no one [who is anti-Israel] wants to hear... and that it is based on statistics and data and is not just an idea... I was honored to be a part of it. It’s flattering, I guess,” she said.
A teaspoon of water
Famed Israeli novelist Amos Oz once wrote that when you see a raging dumpster fire, you have choices: Protest it, ignore it, or try to put it out with whatever water you have – even if it’s just a teaspoon.
“This book is my teaspoon,” Shlachter said. “Everyone has a little teaspoon.”
Shlachter hopes that his book will help readers move from certainty to curiosity. He said he wants everyone to be a tiny bit more curious about the other and not afraid to smile at others and ask them: “What’s your story?”
Shlachter just wrapped up an international book tour that began in Jaffa. The strong turnout in major cities across the United States reflects a growing hunger for meaningful cultural dialogue, the organizers say.
Speaking from the road, where each stop blended conversation, film screenings (a short film about the book), and discussions that engage Jewish communities and the wider public alike, the author described the response as “overwhelming,” with people “going absolutely crazy” about the events, the film, and the book. The next round will likely include Detroit, New York, Miami, and Toronto in late October, with a few sessions in the San Francisco Bay Area in March.

How Israel can use soft power without compromising security - opinion

Israel faces a problem most countries don’t: it cannot trade hard power for soft power without risking the lives of millions of its citizens.
For most nations, this trade is not only possible but advisable. Prioritizing international legitimacy over military dominance, investing in diplomatic relationships over defensive capabilities, choosing approval over strength – these are the hallmarks of successful statecraft in the modern world.
But Israel isn’t like most nations. Its adversaries don’t dispute its policies: they dispute its existence. Its geographic vulnerability – nine miles wide at its narrowest point – makes territorial concessions existential rather than merely strategic. Its neighborhood offers no margin for error.
This creates an impossible dilemma. The international community demands gestures that would improve Israel’s standing abroad while fundamentally compromising its security. Consider the frequent call for immediate Palestinian statehood.
Yes, such a move would likely improve Israel’s standing internationally, at least temporarily. But it would also create a Palestinian state in the Jordan Valley overlooking a narrow coastal strip that contains 70% of Israel’s manufacturing capability and the majority of its population. For a country facing actors explicitly committed to its destruction, this isn’t a security concern – it’s an invitation to national suicide.
Enemies of Israel dispute the nation's right to exist
The pattern repeats across proposed “confidence-building measures.” Each carries the promise of international goodwill and the reality of strategic vulnerability. When your enemies don’t dispute your policies but your very right to exist, you can’t trade hard power for soft power when soft power buys you favorable editorials while hard power keeps your cities from being overrun.
But here's the crucial insight: Israel’s inability to make major territorial or security concessions doesn’t mean it faces no choices. Not all reforms carry equal risk. Some policies genuinely threaten Israeli survival; others merely serve the ideological preferences of its current government while undermining Israel’s democratic character and international standing.
The distinction matters enormously – and it points toward a path forward.
Addressing settler violence doesn’t require Israel to compromise its security. It requires Israel to enforce its own laws, protect Palestinian civilians, and demonstrate that the rule of law applies equally to all. Allowing Israeli citizens to attack Palestinians with impunity doesn’t make Israel safer – it makes it weaker, both morally and strategically.
Every unprosecuted attack, every settlement outpost built in defiance of Israeli law, every violent settler protected by the IDF instead of restrained by him, chips away at Israel’s legitimacy without adding an ounce to its security.
Distancing from racist rhetoric by far-right ministers doesn’t endanger Israeli citizens. Ministers who speak of “erasing” Palestinian villages or refer to Palestinians in dehumanizing terms don’t protect Israel – they provide ammunition to its enemies and alienate its friends. A government that tolerates such rhetoric signals that democratic values are negotiable, that human dignity is conditional, and that the rule of law applies selectively.
Israel can reject this without weakening its defenses.
Engaging in meaningful dialogue with centrist parties on fundamental democratic questions – judicial reform, constitutional frameworks, the balance between majority rule and minority rights – doesn’t compromise national security: It strengthens it. Democracies aren’t strong because they’re democratic –they’re strong because democratic systems create resilience, legitimacy, and social cohesion that authoritarian systems can’t match. When Israel’s current government bypasses democratic norms, concentrates power, and marginalizes opposition voices, it doesn’t make Israel more secure – it makes Israel more brittle.
This isn’t about choosing soft power over hard power. It’s about recognizing that some “hard power” moves aren’t hard at all – they’re just hardline. It’s about understanding that Israel can maintain its military edge, control its borders, and defend its citizens while also upholding the democratic values that justify its existence in the first place.
The reforms outlined above would bolster Israel’s standing not just in hostile international forums, but where it matters most: among Jewish communities worldwide who are struggling to defend Zionism’s values while watching its most far-right government enact policies that betray those very principles.
Young Jews wrestling with their relationship to Israel need to know that loving Israel doesn’t mean defending every action taken in its name. Israel’s genuine supporters need to see that criticism of specific policies isn’t delegitimization of the state itself.
These reforms wouldn’t satisfy Israel’s harshest critics, who object not to Israeli policy but to Israeli existence. But they would strengthen Israel’s position among those who want to support the country but struggle with the gap between its founding ideals and current realities. They would demonstrate that Israel can distinguish between security imperatives and ideological preferences, between protecting citizens and protecting political coalitions, between necessary strength and unnecessary cruelty.
Israel cannot abandon the hard power that keeps its citizens alive. No responsible government would make that trade, and no one should ask them to. The Jordan Valley matters. Air superiority matters. Intelligence capabilities matter. Defensible borders matter.
But Israel can – and must – abandon the policies that serve ideology rather than security, that undermine democracy rather than defend it, and that weaken Israel’s moral standing without strengthening its strategic position. Addressing settler violence, rejecting racist rhetoric, and engaging seriously with democratic reforms don’t threaten Israel’s security: They vindicate the Zionist vision of a democratic Jewish state that treats all people with dignity.
This is the soft power Israel can pursue – not by abandoning defensive capabilities, but by living up to the democratic values it claims to embody. Not by making itself weaker, but by making itself better. That’s not a concession: that’s statecraft.

Sam Halpern: Managing the fast-paced breaking news desk

There are many varied positions at The Jerusalem Post, from reporters to editorial staff to the copy editors and breaking news editors. But another important part of the chain is the humble interns.
While having internships for aspiring journalists is far from unusual, we at the Post pride ourselves on giving our interns real opportunities for journalistic work rather than the stereotypical grunt work of getting coffee. As I always jokingly say, interns are not for getting coffee; that is what new hires are for.
But in all seriousness, our interns come through our doors as massive blocks of potential, and it is their experiences here that help sculpt them into the journalists of tomorrow.
For us at the Post, one of our biggest intern success stories is Sam Halpern. A young man of humble beginnings from Silver Spring, Maryland, Halpern made the most out of his internship at the Post and started working here almost immediately after his internship ended. Since then, he became an integral part of the Breaking News Desk and currently serves as one of our desk managers.
Being an intern here does not guarantee employment with the Post when the stint is over. But if you make the most of your training and learning experience, you will find that the opportunity will be there.
In Jerusalem sat down with Halpern to hear his story, from intern to manager.
What brought you to Israel?
I was brought to Israel by a love for the country and a desire to live in the Jewish homeland.
I had started getting involved in advocacy on a personal level in college and getting involved in Jewish activities and learning about the history of the Jewish people. That led to me studying Hebrew.
Eventually, it seemed to be the right decision to make the move to Israel.
What brought you to the ‘Post’?
When I decided to come to Israel, I didn’t want to come to a new country with nothing. I was looking for a program that could give me work, housing, and community. So I looked online and found Masa. Through that, I got an internship at The Jerusalem Post.
I started at the Post in October 2022, which lasted until March 2023. At the end of that, I went up to the managing editor at the time, Tamar Uriel-Beeri, and asked if she wanted me to stay, and she said yes.
I went back to the US for a couple of months, and then I started as a Breaking News Desk editor.
I was in that position for only a matter of months before I was asked to step into the role of desk manager in December 2023, just a couple of months after the war started. I started as a desk manager the next month.
What is it like going from intern to Breaking News Desk editor to desk manager?
It’s really special to have had this trajectory. I came to Israel looking to write and tell the story of this country. As an English major, I wanted to write and talk about Israel. So getting this internship and being able to rise through the field has been incredible.
Tell me one of your favorite anecdotes from your career thus far.
One of the coolest experiences of being on the desk is writing something and having an impact of some sort.
Sometimes you’re reposted by a significant international figure.
One of my favorite anecdotes was of writing a story about UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories Francesca Albanese. I had heard she said something on Twitter, so I went to look it up in the office on the Post’s account. That’s when I realized we couldn’t see any of her posts and that we had been blocked by Ms. Albanese herself.
I wrote the story and noted that she had blocked the Post. Then, Jerusalem Post Editor-in-Chief Zvika Klein wrote an article about whether it was appropriate for a UN special rapporteur to block a media outlet. Albanese then had to comment on it, claiming it was an accident.
What is something about the job most people don’t know?
I think the main thing people don’t realize about this job is that breaking news is really such a fast-paced world. It’s an honor to be able to do the job, and it’s not for the faint of heart.
Every day, the people who work with breaking news are doing their utmost to own the service of bringing people around the world the truth about what’s going on. And it’s fast. We all feel the pressure to get it right.
In that sense, it’s really a labor of love to bring people the news of what’s happening in a timely and accurate way.
What advice do you have for aspiring journalists?
As someone who came up as an intern and is currently a desk manager, I’d say the thing that got me from there to here is just working hard.
If you are willing to apply yourself and are willing to take criticism and feedback and not look at it as an insult but as an opportunity to grow – if you’re willing to humble yourself and ask questions to those who have been doing this longer than you – then you can always get better.

The victory was about far more than sport. Israeli Muay Thai fighter Ahavat Hashem Gordon delivered a dominant performance on Saturday night, forcing Turkish opponent Ali Koyuncu to retire after just two rounds in a bout charged with political tension and antisemitic provocations.
From the opening bell at the Žalgirio Arena in Lithuania, Gordon showed clear superiority in two particularly aggressive rounds, as emotions between the fighters spilled into the ring. After sustaining heavy punishment, Koyuncu withdrew, claiming he could no longer step on his foot.
The bout had been preceded by weeks of hostility. Koyuncu openly displayed political animosity toward his Israeli rival, raising his middle finger at Gordon and issuing antisemitic threats. The situation grew serious enough that the Israeli Embassy in Lithuania requested reinforced security around Gordon ahead of the fight.
In the lead-up to the match, the Turkish fighter posted a series of pro-Palestinian messages on social media, alongside harsh statements and threats directed at Gordon that drew widespread attention and numerous responses.
In videos shared to his personal accounts, Koyuncu appeared alongside a countdown clock to the fight, using inflammatory language and speaking of the "bloodshed" he expected his Israeli opponent to suffer. In one post, he wrote that on February 21 he would face an Israeli fighter and called on the entire Turkish nation to support him.
Tensions were also evident during the pre-fight face-off event, when Koyuncu attempted to choke and kick Gordon. The Israeli fighter stood his ground, proudly draped in an Israeli flag.

Trump doubles down on closing tax loophole on cheap imports
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TAIPEI - Hours after the Supreme Court struck down a significant portion of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs,
That policy, known as the de minimis exemption, had let US importers bring in goods valued at less than US$800 (S$1,013) without paying taxes or completing detailed customs paperwork. The loophole allowed millions of packages to come straight from Chinese factories to American homes duty-free. Mr Trump has said the exemption also enabled deadly synthetic opioids like fentanyl and their ingredients to flow into the United States.
The exemption was used mostly by companies operating in China, just as American shoppers were getting hooked on buying inexpensive items online and the Chinese government was pushing its manufacturers to find buyers overseas. First on platforms including eBay and Amazon, and then on apps including Shein and Temu, exporters funneled the products of China’s vast manufacturing supply chain straight to the United States. Many American businesses also relied on the exemption for goods sold on sites including Etsy and Shopify.
The exemption, intended to spare customs officials from spending too much time and money processing goods of relatively little value, existed for almost a century. The threshold has changed repeatedly over the years and was raised from US$200 to US$800 in 2016.
Mr Trump ended the exemption for products from China in May and for items from the rest of the world in July.
Although it did not address de minimis directly, the Supreme Court’s decision appeared to invalidate one of the legal grounds for Mr Trump’s decision to end the exemption, potentially opening the door for such inexpensive tax-free shipments to resume.
But in an executive order hours later, Mr Trump said the flow of such goods remained a national emergency, and an independent issue from the basis for other tariff actions. The loophole would remain closed, the order said.
The order claimed the same legal authorities as previous executive orders on the de minimis issue. The order did not directly address the court’s ruling.
These actions add to the complexity that businesses around the world have faced over the past year, as the Trump administration has dismantled the rules that previously governed global trade.
Mr Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a think tank that generally favours lower taxes, said the confusion over de minimis adds another challenge for businesses that have adjusted to repeated changes in tariff policy over the past year.
“There’s still this looming tariff uncertainty in general,” Mr Durante said. “In some senses, it’s even worse now.”
Mr Song Guoyou, an expert on US-China economic relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the Supreme Court’s decision will likely boost some Chinese exports to the United States. The overall tariff on goods from China is expected to come down because the ruling invalidated, for example, the so-called fentanyl tariff that added 10 per cent to the overall duties on Chinese imports.
However, Mr Song said that Chinese businesses are still grappling with the unpredictable, shifting nature of the Trump administration’s trade policies.
“For Chinese enterprises, the policy uncertainty of the Trump administration always exists,” he said.
Separately, the sweeping legislation to extend tax cuts and slash social safety net programmes, which Mr Trump referred to as the “big, beautiful bill” signed into law last July, will do away with the previous law that had established the de minimis exemption starting in July 2027.
Chinese retailers are also facing tougher policies in the European Union, which plans to impose a flat fee on packages worth less than 150 euros (S$224) beginning in July.
E-commerce stocks went up on Feb 20 after the Supreme Court issued its decision. Etsy ended the day up 8 per cent and eBay up 4 per cent, while Amazon and Pinduoduo, the parent company of Chinese retailer Temu, closed up about 3 per cent. NYTIMES

Saved by a square: A rainy-day miracle at Jerusalem’s Hebrew Music Museum

When the Birthright group I was leading, comprised of 23 people with autism, found ourselves unable to leave Jerusalem for the Dead Sea and Ein Gedi because the roads were closed due to rain, we had to find an alternative plan – FAST! And it had to be in Jerusalem so we would stay on track for our lunch reservations at Focaccia Bar and doing community service at Colel Chabad’s Pantry Packers. With such a busy day ahead, the chosen activity would have to start in half an hour!
The tour guide and I got off the bus when we got the last-minute news of the road closure, took out our phones, put on our thinking caps, and began to brainstorm from the limited number of indoor options that could accommodate a fairly large group at a moment’s notice. We took a chance and called a place we hadn’t known about: The Hebrew Music Museum.
Within 30 minutes, our group, which included a participant with quadriplegia who required a fully accessible space, were exploring and sampling instruments which most of us had never heard of from various countries and periods of history. This gem of a museum, in the Nahalat Shiva neighborhood at Kikar Hamusica (Music Square), had a talented musician and guide on hand, Roi Baruch, who could demonstrate the instruments and explain them in English. Available languages for tours also include Spanish, Hebrew, French, and Russian – but not usually at the drop of a hat like ours.
Our tour included explanations, stories, and demonstrations – and, perhaps most importantly, a chance for our Birthright participants to try out the instruments. It is also possible to tour the museum’s seven rooms in a most impressive architectural structure using audio-visual technology with “Grandpa Levi,” its animated guide.
Each room presented a different region or culture: Central Asia; Morocco-Andalusia; Europe-Ashkenaz; Africa, Ethiopia, and Yemen; the Balkan Peninsula; Iraq, Syria, and Egypt; and ancient Hebrew nations. The latter includes instruments of ancient times and a virtual reality tour of the instruments used by the Levites in the Temple.
It was my first time experiencing virtual reality, and I was mesmerized by the Holy Temple – and its sacrifices – coming alive. I should have listened to Baruch when he suggested that I take a seat. The 3-D experience was so realistic, that I felt unstable standing while watching the action unfold in front of me.
School groups and most casual visitors will be so taken by the instruments and the Temple that they may not stop to contemplate how this privately funded museum got here and how it fits into the larger gem of a “musical square” in the heart of Jerusalem. Museum founder Laurent Levy, a lifelong lover of music – and CEO of the successful Optical Center chain – has reported that he draws inspiration from many places, including the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
“The idea becomes tangible, and I conceptualize innovative concepts to the last detail,” Levy said. “I instill in each of these works a strong desire that every user can see the beauty and hear the good, and hence make the world a better place.” He added, “I am also inspired from study of the Torah, the Talmud, the Kabbalah, and the biblical prophets. I consider every human being a source of inspiration and try to learn from everyone, regardless of age, culture, or nationality.”
Levy made aliyah in 2005, established an online optical center in 2006, and opened his first Israel Optical Center in Jerusalem in 2007. A year later, the center also included a hearing aid department.
Music Square becomes cultural hub
The entrepreneurial, creative Levy next launched a Jerusalem apartment rental website, wrote a book titled The Seven Keys to Success, and in 2014 ventured into the Jerusalem music sphere. He opened Kikar Hamusica that year, followed by the Blue Hall Music pub and the Kinor b’Kikar (Violin in the Square) restaurant. In 2016, he opened the Hebrew Music Museum and has since established his sixth restaurant in Music Square.
Thanks to Levy, visitors of all ages to Jerusalem have ample opportunities to experience music – and get a great pair of glasses! Our Birthright group is appreciative that Levy and the talented staff of the museum truly helped turn our rainy-day disappointment into a morning of fun and engagement through music. I look forward to bringing future groups in nicer weather to experience daily live performances in Music Square of every genre – from jazz and samba to rock and roll, reggae, and klezmer.
Live music, interesting instruments, and flavorful food – all in one place, all provided by one enterprising guy!

Salsa legend Willie Colon, dead at 75

Salsa music icon Willie Colon died on Saturday, February 21, his family and longtime manager said, leaving fans mourning the loss of "an architect of the New York sound."
Colon, known best as a trombonist but who was also a bandleader and producer, was born in the Bronx and known for blending the Puerto Rican music of his parents and grandparents with his home city's jazz.
He was 75. A cause of death was not given.
Born William Anthony Colon Roman in 1950, the music star "passed away peacefully this morning," his family said in a statement.
"We've lost an architect of the New York sound," said manager Pietro Carolos.
"Willie didn't just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles and took it to stages where it hadn't been heard before."
Colon was playing in his own band by 15 and released an album at 17. He went on to record hit records with Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe in the 1960s and 1970s.
"Siembra," released in 1978 with vocalist Ruben Blades, addressed social issues faced by the growing Latino community in the United States.
"I came from a really tough neighborhood," he once told music publication Billboard.
"My father spent time in jail. Almost everybody went to jail... there was a lot of interaction between us and the police."
He only studied music in junior high school but continued playing and touring through 2025.
In a mark of his continued influence, he is name-checked in Grammy-winning singer Bad Bunny's 2025 hit "Nueva Yol."

Trump's Mar-a-Lago could be targeted if US attacks Iran, says Iranian MP - report

An Iranian member of parliament warned that Iran could expand any wartime response beyond the Middle East and said that even US President Donald Trump’s “own palace” could be targeted, according to remarks published by Iranian outlet Didban Iran and later translated by Iran International.
The lawmaker was identified as Amir Hayat Moghaddam, a member of Iran’s parliament and its national security and foreign policy commission. Iran International quoted him as saying Iran would deliver a “crushing response” if attacked by the United States.
According to the report, Moghaddam said Iran could sink a US warship in the Sea of Oman, strike US bases in the region, and target American forces, including “soldier, officer, or general.”
Attacks might not be limited to the Middle East
He also said Iran’s attacks might not remain limited to the Middle East and could reach the US itself, adding that “Trump’s own palace” could one day be hit, in an apparent reference to Mar-a-Lago.
Didban Iran’s homepage listing shows the interview headline carrying the same language and identifies Moghaddam as a member of the parliamentary committee.
No immediate US official response to Moghaddam’s specific remarks was identified in the reports reviewed by The Jerusalem Post at the time of publication. Reuters coverage on Friday focused on the broader US-Iran escalation, including President Trump’s warning that Iran must make a deal within 10 to 15 days and Tehran’s threats to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked.

Brother tracked down sister swept up in Utah avalanche but wasn’t able to save her
11-year-old girl died in the hospital, police say

The brother of an 11-year-old girl who was trapped in a backcountry avalanche in Utah was able to locate his sister, but she later died in the hospital after her rescue, according to officials.
Madelyn Eitas and her family were skiing outside the boundaries of Brighton Ski Resort, about 25 miles east of Salt Lake City, when an avalanche struck in the early afternoon Thursday.
About 20 strangers joined Wasatch Backcountry Rescue and the Unified Police Department and Fire Authority of Greater Salt Lake in the resulting search.
“Her brother, Cameron Eitas, heroically used an application to locate her,” police said in a statement. “Numerous agencies responded and worked together in an urgent and coordinated effort to care for the victim in attempts to provide life-saving measures.”
Due to safety concerns in the area, air rescue was not possible, and Madelyn Eitas, who hails from Rochester, Massachusetts, was eventually taken by ambulance to a local hospital.
“Despite the tremendous and exhaustive efforts of family, first responders and hospital medical staff, the victim tragically passed away,” the police department said.
"She was sweet and sassy, always laughing and dancing," her mother, Becky Eitas, told WCVB. "She loved her family and friends and her big brother so much."
“This is devastating news for our school community,” Old Rochester Regional School District said in a statement to the outlet. “We offer our sincere condolences to the student's family, friends, classmates, and teachers during this unimaginable time.”
Skiers Maggie and Harrison Garner assisted in the search.
“It was kind of just like a surreal thing,” Maggie Garner, a student at Utah Valley University, told KSLTV. “We were like, ‘What’s even really happening right now?’”
“It was just scary and crazy,” Harrison Garner, a junior at Bingham High School, added.
Thursday’s avalanche followed news that two people died in a separate avalanche while snowmobiling in the region.
Authorities continue to warn of high avalanche danger in the mountains outside Salt Lake City following heavy snows throughout the week.
“The avalanche danger is CONSIDERABLE, and today is NOT the day to be in steep avalanche terrain,” according to a Saturday forecast from the Utah Avalanche Center. “That means staying off of — and out from under — slopes steeper than 30 degrees. Large, destructive, and potentially deadly slab avalanches are likely.
“This week’s heavy snowfall and strong winds overloaded preexisting weak layers, creating a HIGH avalanche danger across the entire state.”
Officials in California and Nevada are also sorting through the aftermath of a deadly backcountry avalanche.
Search crews have finished recovering all nine bodies of the people killed in an avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe, officials announced Saturday. The incident is California’s deadliest known avalanche.

Trump approves disaster assistance to DC to help with sewage spill into Potomac River
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River
- Bookmark
President Donald Trump has approved emergency assistance to Washington, D.C., to help the city address a sewage system leak that dumped at least 250 million gallons of raw sewage into the Potomac River.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Trump's approval on Saturday, allowing FEMA to provide equipment and resources to help with the response to the Jan. 19 spill after a pipeline ruptured.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had requested the federal help on Wednesday and declared an emergency.
Trump's approval of the disaster relief request comes after he criticized the handling of the spill, blaming local Democratic leaders and focusing especially on Maryland's Democratic Gov. Wes Moore.
He said in his social media posts criticizing the response that local officials had not asked for emergency help and he intended to step in.
However, the federal government was already involved in the repair and assessing the impact of the leak through the Environmental Protection Agency.
The 72-inch (183 centimeter) pipeline, known as the Potomac Interceptor, burst on Jan. 19, sending 250 million gallons of untreated sewage into the Potomac River just north of Washington in the first five days.
The leak is largely under control, but it could take months to repair the pipe fully. The local water utility, DC Water, along with the EPA, has been working to repair the leak and monitor the impact on the river.
Officials have said the area's drinking water is safe, but people who use the Potomac River for recreation are being cautioned not to have direct contact with the water.

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’

Trump ‘could kill ayatollah’s son and senior mullahs to topple Iranian regime’
Updated ,first published
Donald Trump is considering plans to assassinate the son of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei among the military options for a strike on Iran.
The US president has reportedly been presented with a decapitation campaign against the leadership of the Islamic Republic. Mojtaba Khamenei is on the list alongside his father.
The supreme leader’s 55-year-old son had been thought his most likely successor, benefiting from close ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp, a powerful branch of the armed forces that has been designated a terrorist entity by the United States.
Mojtaba also served in the Iran-Iraq war and studied theology in the holy city of Qom, meeting the constitutional requirement for clerical training.
Trump had not yet decided on whether to strike Iran, Axios news website reported. He could allow a deal that permits the regime to continue with “token” nuclear enrichment, as long as it has no path to an atomic bomb.
But should negotiations over Iran’s nuclear enrichment program fail, among the options under consideration is a dramatic assassination campaign that would aim at wholesale regime change.
“They have something for every scenario. One scenario takes out the ayatollah and his son and the mullahs,” a senior US official told Axios.
The US has dispatched more than one-third of its navy towards Iran and assembled the largest amount of air power in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Analysts have pointed to the deployment of more than two-thirds of the available E-3 Sentry fleet as one sign that Trump is prepared to launch military action, with the radars of the reconnaissance aircraft needed to track and direct the interception of incoming missiles.
On Friday (US time), Trump confirmed he was considering a “limited” strike on Iran in an attempt to pressure the regime into making a nuclear deal.
In theory, that strike would display US power but fall below the threshold for provoking a serious response from Tehran. But the risks of a spiralling conflict are self-evident.
The White House’s openness to Iran continuing a scaled-back enrichment program, as confirmed by a senior US official cited by Axios, could create room for a deal and avert war in the Middle East.
However, the outlet noted that any nuclear proposal from Iran would have to meet a very high bar to persuade sceptics within the Trump administration that military action was not needed.
It remains unclear how “token” enrichment would be defined, and what supervision would be in place to ensure Iranian compliance. Iran does not have a strong track record of allowing UN nuclear inspectors to monitor activities.
The senior US official said: “[Trump] will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home.
“If the Iranians want to prevent an attack, they should give us an offer we can’t refuse. The Iranians keep missing the window. If they play games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”
On Thursday, Trump said he would give Iran “10 to 15 days” to come to a deal.
The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, entered the Mediterranean Sea on Friday and will arrive in range of Iran within the timeframe of 10 to 15 days.
Two Israeli officials said they believed the gaps between Washington and Tehran were unbridgeable and the chances of a military escalation were high.
Israel’s government is making preparations for possible joint military action with the US. However, no decision had been made on whether to carry out such an operation, a source familiar with the planning told Reuters.
It would be the second time the US and Israel have attacked Iran in less than a year, following air strikes against military and nuclear facilities in June. Regional officials said oil-producing Gulf countries were preparing for a possible military confrontation that they feared could spin out of control and further destabilise the Middle East.
Some said Tehran was dangerously miscalculating by holding out for concessions, while Trump was boxed in by the build-up of military assets.
They feared he would be unable to scale it back without losing face unless there was a firm commitment from Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions.
Earlier this week, the US began moving some personnel out of the Middle East to prepare for potential counter-attacks by Iran if Washington strikes Tehran in the coming days.
At least 20 anti-regime protests were held in Iran on Friday at memorials to mark the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for protesters killed by security forces.
Thousands of demonstrators were killed after taking to the streets over economic woes and a lack of water in Tehran. The violence is what first prompted Trump to make his latest threats of retaliation against the Iranian regime.

Democrats’ fear rising that too many candidates in governor’s race could lead to a Republican victory

- California Democrats worry their crowded governor’s race could allow two Republicans to advance to the general election under the state’s unique primary system.
- With nine Democratic candidates splitting votes, Republicans Steve Hilton and Chad Bianco currently lead polls.
- Some Democratic candidates resisted calls to exit the race, arguing the field remains wide open and the party should trust voters to decide.
SAN FRANCISCO — Leaders of the California Democratic Party, along with liberal activists and loyal power brokers, are openly expressing fear that their crowded field of candidates running for governor may splinter the vote and open the door to a surprise Republican victory in November.
Because of those concerns, the Democrats lagging at the bottom of the pack are being urged to drop out of the race to ensure that the party’s political dominance in statewide elections survives the 2026 election.
“California Democrats are prepared to do what’s required,” state party chairman Rusty Hicks told reporters at the California Democratic Party’s annual convention on Friday. “We are ready and willing and able to do what’s required … to ensure we have a strong candidate coming out of the primary to do what’s required in November.”
Nine prominent Democrats are running to replace termed-out Gov. Gavin Newsom, compared with two top GOP candidates, and could divide the Democratic electorate enough that the two Republicans could receive the most votes in the June primary and advance to the November election. Under California’s “jungle primary” system, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of their party affiliation.
Hicks was deferential to the Democratic candidates who have long served in public office and have compelling personal tales and the experience to take the helm of the state. But he said there is the harsh political reality that a viable candidate needs to raise an enormous amount of money to have a winning campaign in a state of 23.1 million registered voters and some of the most expensive media markets in the nation.
The party, its allies and the candidates themselves have a “collective commitment to ensuring we do not see a Republican elected [for governor],” Hicks said.
While Hicks and other party leaders did not publicly name the candidates who ought to leave the race, among the candidates lagging in the polls are state Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, former state Controller Betty Yee, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon.
The wide-open race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor has attracted a large and diverse field of candidates.
Democratic voters vastly outnumber the number of registered Republicans in the state, and no Republican has been elected to statewide office since 2006.
But given the sprawling field of gubernatorial candidates, the lack of a clear front-runner and the state’s unique primary system, the race appears up for grabs. According to an average of the most recent opinion polls, conservative commentator Steve Hilton and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco — both Republicans — are tied for first place, according to Real Clear Politics. Each received the support of 15.5% of voters. The top Democrat, Rep. Eric Swalwell of Dublin, Calif., was backed by 12.5%.
In 2012, Republicans finished in first and second place in the race for a San Bernardino County congressional district — despite Democrats having a solid edge in voter registration. The four Democrats running for the seat split the vote, opening the door for a victory by GOP Rep. Gary Miller. Pete Aguilar, one of the Democrats who lost in the primary, went on to win that seat in 2014 and has served in Congress ever since.
Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) on Friday pushed back at the fears that two Republicans will win the top two gubernatorial spots in June.
“That’s not going to happen,” she said in an interview after speaking at a young Democrats’ reception. “And everything that you should know about the Democrats this year is we are unified. As I say, our diversity is our strength, our unity is our power. And everybody knows that there’s too much at stake.”
However, the scenario has prompted a cross section of the typically fractious party to unite behind the belief the field must shrink, whether by candidates’ choice or through pressure.
Jodi Hicks, the leader of Planned Parenthood’s California operations, said that the organization is laser-focused on congressional races, but having two Republican gubernatorial candidates “would be nothing short of devastating.”
“We have not weighed in on the governor’s race, but we are paying close attention to whether this comes to play, and whether or not we do decide to weigh in and make sure that doesn’t happen,” she said.
Newsom and legislative Democrats have tried to buffer the massive federal funding cuts to reproductive care. A November election with two Republicans on the gubernatorial ballot would eliminate a key partner in Sacramento, and could affect turnout in down-ballot congressional and legislative races.
“A top-two Republican [race] would certainly have dire consequences for the midterm battle and to the governor’s office,” Jodi Hicks said.
Lorena Gonzalez, the leader of California Federation of Labor Unions, noted that her organization’s endorsement process begins on Tuesday.
“I think we are going to have some pretty honest discussions with candidates about their individual paths and where they are,” she said. “They’re all great candidates, so many of them are really good folks. But it’s starting to get to be that time.”
She expects the field to begin to thin in the coming days and weeks.
The conversation went beyond party leaders, taking place among delegates such as Gregory Hutchins, an academic labor researcher from Riverside.
“My goal at the convention, it’s not necessarily that the party coalesces around one particular candidate, but more, this is a test to see what candidates have a level of support that they can mount a successful campaign,” said the 29-year-old, who said he hopes to see some candidates drop out after the weekend.
“Am I concerned long term that [a top-two Republican runoff] could be a thing? Yes and no,” he said. “I’m not concerned that we’re not going to solve this problem before the primary, but I do think we need to start getting serious about, ‘We need to solve this problem soon.’”
Not everyone agreed.
Tim Paulson, a San Francisco Democrat who supports Yee, called efforts to push people out of the race “preemptive disqualification.”
“This is nothing but scare tactics to get people out of the race,” he said. “This is still a vibrant primary. Nobody knows who the front-runner is yet.”
Bob Galemmo, 71, countered that many people did not believe Donald Trump would be elected president in 2016 and fears two Republicans could advance to the general election.
“You should never say never,” he said. “If we could get down to like four or five [candidates], that would be helpful.”
The efforts have already begun.
RL Miller, the chair of the state Democratic Party’s environmental caucus, said Yee ought to drop out.
Yee, “who is at the bottom of the polls, needs to be taking a good long look at whether she is serving the party or being selfish by staying in the race,” Miller said.
Yee, a former state party vice chair, pushed back forcefully, saying pressure to drop out of the race “would just be undemocratic.”
“First of all, I’ve served this party for a long time. I don’t do it out of selfishness, by any means,” she said at a Saturday gathering where she provided breakfast burritos to delegates. “But I’ll just say this — the race is wide open.”
Yee‘s campaign manager noted that the largest group of voters is still undecided, and the candidate said no one has asked her directly to exit the race, but that someone started a rumor a month or two ago that she was going to drop out and run for insurance commissioner instead.
“I’m not dropping out, and I don’t think any candidate should go out,” Yee said.
Calderon said Swalwell had urged him to get out of the race.
Calderon defended staying in the race to try to reach undecided voters during a gubernatorial forum at the Commonwealth Club on Friday.
“I stay very consistent in that 1 to 3% range,” he joked. “But my challenge is access to resources and visibility, which is something that could change within a day with the right backing and support.”
Swalwell denied asking Calderon to leave the race.
“I never said that,” Swalwell said in an interview at a Saturday evening dinner honoring Pelosi. “I’ve enjoyed being on the trail with him, and it’s every candidate’s decision to make about their own direction.”

Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, architect of urban salsa music, dies at 75
Willie Colón, the Grammy-nominated architect of urban salsa music and social activist, died Saturday. He was 75.
Over his decades-long career, the trombonist, composer, arranger and singer produced more than 40 albums that sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. He collaborated with a wide range of artists, including the Fania All Stars, David Byrne and Celia Cruz.
His celebrated collaboration with Rubén Blades, “Siembra,” became one of the bestselling salsa albums of all time, and the pair were known for addressing social issues through the genre.
Colón’s family and manager confirmed his death through social media posts.
“Willie didn’t just change salsa; he expanded it, politicized it, clothed it in urban chronicles, and took it to stages where it hadn’t been heard before,” manager Pietro Carlos wrote. “His trombone was the voice of the people, an echo of the Caribbean in New York, a bridge between two cultures.”
Colón, who was nominated for 10 Grammys and one Latin Grammy, made famous songs such as “El gran varón,” “Sin poderte hablar,” “Casanova,” “Amor verdad” and “Oh, qué será.”
Blades said on the social platform X that he confirmed “what I was reluctant to believe” and offered his condolences to Colón’s family.
The path to the trombone — and fame
Born in New York’s Bronx borough, Colón was raised by his grandmother and aunt, who from a young age nurtured him with traditional Puerto Rican music and the typical rhythms of the Latin American repertoire, including Cuban son and tango.
At age 11 he ventured into the world of music, first with flute, then bugle, trumpet and finally trombone, with which he stood out in the then-nascent genre of salsa.
His interest in trombone arose after hearing Barry Rogers playing it on “Dolores,” Mon Rivera’s song with Joe Cotto.
“It sounded like an elephant, a lion ... an animal. Something so different that, as soon as I heard it, I said to myself: ‘I want to play that instrument,’” he recalled in an interview published in the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo in 2011.
At 17 he joined the group of artists that formed the famous record label Fania Records, led and created by Jerry Masucci and Johnny Pacheco. Fania was largely responsible for the new sound that was produced in the Latin world of New York and would later be called “salsa.”
Colón’s main characteristic as a musician was the fusion of rhythms, as he harmonized jazz, rock, funk, soul and R&B with the old Latin school of Cuban son, cha-cha-cha, mambo and guaracha, adding the nostalgia of the traditional Puerto Rican sound that encompasses jíbara, bomba and plena music.
In 2004 the Latin Recording Academy awarded Colón a special Grammy for his career and contributions to music.
Community leader and activist
As a community leader, Colón fought for civil rights, mostly in the United States. He was part of the Hispanic Arts Association, the Latino Commission on AIDS, the Arthur Schomburg Coalition for a Better New York and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, among others.
In 1991 he was honored with the Chubb fellowship from Yale University, a public service recognition also awarded to the likes of John F. Kennedy, Moshe Dayan, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Ronald Reagan, among others.
In the political arena, he served as special assistant to David Dinkins, New York’s first Black mayor, and was later appointed special assistant and adviser to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Colón had little luck running for public office himself, however. He failed in a challenge to then-U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel in the 1994 Democratic primary, and in 2001 came in third in the Democratic primary for New York’s public advocate.
He backed Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2008, but he told the Observer that he voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
Colón had public clashes with artists and politicians. His friendship with Blades ruptured after Colón sued for breach of contract over the 2003 concert “Siembra ... 25 years later,” held in Puerto Rico. He also sparked a controversy when he called the then-president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, “rotten” on a social network.
Colón acted in films such as “Vigilante,” “The Last Fight” and “It Could Happen to You,” and on TV in “Miami Vice” and “Demasiado Corazón.” More recently he appeared in Bad Bunny’s music video for “NuevaYol.”
He is survived by his wife and four sons.

I am tired of Tucker Carlson’s Israel show, when Mike Huckabee deserves focus - comment
Unknown

Everyone is talking about Tucker Carlson. I get it.
He’s a genius of the attention economy, a man who turned provocation into a career and the airport lounge into a geopolitical stage. Candace Owens runs the same playbook. They’re performers. And they’re increasingly beside the point.
US Ambassador Mike Huckabee sat across from Carlson at Ben-Gurion Airport and did something nobody seems to want to talk about. He made an argument. A real one. Patient, specific, grounded, the kind you can actually follow from beginning to end.
But first, I have a confession to make: “Christian Zionism” entered my working vocabulary embarrassingly late.
For years, the phrase lived somewhere in the back of my mind as a sociological curiosity, somewhere between a footnote and a conference panel I’d skip. Then October 7 happened, and the footnotes started mattering.
American Christians care about Jewish survival
While Jewish intellectuals were busy being nuanced, millions of American Christians were busy actually caring about Jewish survival. Not abstractly. Practically. Showing up.
Huckabee is one of them. He’s also, it turns out, quite good at explaining why.
He defined Zionism simply: Jews have a right to a homeland where they can live with security and safety. He defined a Christian Zionist as someone who believes Israel has a right to exist. You might find that modest. I find it clarifying.
When the baseline has drifted so far that stating Israel’s right to exist reads as a controversial position, saying it plainly and without embarrassment is its own kind of act.
When Carlson tried to steer the conversation toward his usual grievance tour, Huckabee said early on that he wanted them to “talk to each other and not about each other.”
That’s such a small sentence, and it did so much work. He’d decided before the cameras rolled that he was there to persuade, and he spent the whole interview doing exactly that.
When Carlson insinuated that supporting Israel creates some kind of conflict of interest for an American diplomat, Huckabee looked down at his lapel. “What flag am I wearing here? It’s my flag. It’s who I serve.”
The argument that pro-Israel Americans are somehow disloyal to their own country is one of the uglier ideas making the rounds right now, on the MAGA Right and the campus Left simultaneously, which tells you something, and Huckabee cut through it without raising his voice.
On the money, he was equally clear. American military assistance to Israel cycles back through American defense procurement. It buys an ally in one of the world’s most dangerous neighborhoods. Israel is, he said, “the tip of the spear.”
Argue with the metaphor if you want. The underlying point holds: this alliance has a strategic logic that would cost far more to replace than it costs to maintain. He wasn’t asking anyone for charity. He was describing how deterrence works.
On Iran, he said what the situation actually requires saying: that a regime that has spent decades chanting “Death to America” should probably be taken at its word.
Here’s what got me interested in this conversation: When Carlson raised the harassment of Christians in Israel, and it does happen, it’s a real problem, responsible people acknowledge it, Huckabee didn’t change the subject.
He called it what it is. Spitting on Christians comes from “an evil heart,” he said, and “they should go to jail here.” That’s how a real friend talks. Holding an ally to its own values because you believe it can actually meet them.
He also mentioned, almost as an aside, that he’d made over a hundred trips to Israel across several decades. That he goes to church every Sunday. That he plays bass guitar in his church band. That he’s never been bothered for being a Christian there. Carlson flew in, stayed in the terminal, flew out, and made content. Huckabee has spent 30 years building familiarity with a place.
At the end, he invited Carlson back. Come see more. Come to church with me. See that Christians are pretty free here. It was the tone of someone with nothing to hide, a host, not a supplicant.
I know the temptation among Jews and Israelis right now is toward a certain wariness about Christian support. After watching institutions they trusted dissolve over the past two years, suspicion feels like the grown-up position. I understand it.
But Huckabee sat in that airport and made the full case, strategically, morally, personally, when making it cost something. He didn’t flinch, didn’t deflect, didn’t reach for the easy answer.
Carlson will keep generating headlines. He always does. But Huckabee made the argument, and arguments have a longer half-life than clips.
The least we can do is pay attention and thank Huckabee for speaking the truth of sane Judeo-Christian values.

Former UK PM Boris Johnson says UK should immediately send non-combat troops to Ukraine
Speaking ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Mr Johnson told the BBC that these troops should be stationed in peaceful regions

Former prime minister Boris Johnson has called for troops from the UK and Europe to be deployed immediately to Ukraine.
Mr Johnson said non-combat forces should be stationed in peaceful regions to send a firm message to Russian president Vladimir Putin otherwise the Russian leader would “keep going” with the conflict.
Speaking ahead of the four-year anniversary of the invasion, the former politician told BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that Ukraine’s allies had been “too slow” to respond.
“We've always delayed needlessly,” he said. “We've then ended up giving the Ukrainians what they have been asking for, and actually it's always served to their advantage and to the disadvantage of Putin. I mean, the one person who suffers from escalation is Putin.”
In the comments, which are set to air on Sunday, Mr Johnson said that he saw no reason why military action could not be taken to support Ukraine during wartime if security guarantees were promised in the event of a ceasefire.
“If we are willing to do it in the context of a ceasefire, which of course puts all the initiative, all the power, in Putin’s hands, why not do it now?’” he questioned.
“There is no logical reason that I can see why we shouldn’t send peaceful ground forces there to show our support, our constitutional support for a free, independent Ukraine.”
Military strategists and commentators have suggested that such a move could be interpreted by Russia as an escalation. Putin has previously remarked that Russia is “ready right now” for war if Europe wants it.
Putin rejected Western peacekeeping proposals in September warning that troops deployed to protect Ukraine would be considered “legitimate targets”.
Mr Johnson pushed back on those comments and insisted that Ukraine and its supporters should be able to operate on their own terms not those dictated by Russia.
“It’s about whether Ukraine is a free country or not,” he said. “If it’s a vassal state of Russia, which is what Putin wants, then obviously it’s up to Putin to decide who comes to his country. If it’s not, then it’s up to the Ukrainians.”
Britain’s ministry of defence responded to the comments to reiterate the government’s existing policy, confirming that ongoing work with the “coalition of the willing” would prepare for troop deployment in the event of a ceasefire.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities,” the ministry said in a statement.
Mr Johnson also blamed Western failures for the invasion citing a lack of support for Ukraine after the invasion of Crimea in 2014, a chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan and delays in punishing Bashar al-Assad for the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
“I think Putin was emboldened by a Western failure in Syria to punish Assad for using chemical weapons,” he said.
“I think Putin was further emboldened in February 2022 by what he’d seen in Afghanistan, and a sort of general sense that the West was on the back foot. He’d seen those appalling pictures of Americans being forced to flee Afghanistan and the UK pulling out as well, and that really did embolden him.”
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “We are proud of UK leadership on Ukraine – supporting the fight today and working to secure the peace tomorrow.
“It’s why this Government is providing the highest ever level of military support, including a recent half-billion-pound air defence package just last week, accelerating £200 million for the UK military to prepare for any Ukraine deployment, and working with over 30 nations through the UK-led coalition of the willing.
“The multinational force Ukraine under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term, with the Prime Minister being clear that we will put British troops on the ground following the end of hostilities.”

Nico O’Reilly double seals key 2-1 win for Man City over Newcastle United
Manchester City’s win cut Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League to two points.
Nico O’Reilly’s first-half brace inspired Manchester City to a vital 2-1 victory over Newcastle United, which turned up the heat on Premier League leaders Arsenal.
City took the lead on Saturday when O’Reilly slammed in a left-footed shot in the 14th minute before Lewis Hall levelled.

O’Reilly headed in Erling Haaland’s cross to restore City’s lead in the 27th minute, and it proved to be the match-winner as Pep Guardiola’s side cut Arsenal’s lead to two points.
Arsenal face north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, knowing that City are now breathing down their necks.
The stuttering form of Arsenal, who drew with the bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday, opened the door for City, but victory over Newcastle was imperative.
It looked like a formality early on as they overran their visitors, but it was a different story after the break as they nervously held on to the victory.
Nothing illustrated City’s determination more than the sight of goal-machine Haaland working tirelessly back in his own area, blocking shots and making clearing headers.
Newcastle pushed hard for an equaliser, and when the final whistle blew, there was relief around Etihad Stadium. They will now be watching Arsenal’s Sunday derby with added interest.
City were slick at the start and went ahead when a surging Omar Marmoush played in O’Reilly. He could have touched it on for Haaland to his left, but the 20-year-old opted to trust his left foot, and his powerful shot beat Nick Pope.
Newcastle were level soon afterwards, though, as a weak clearance fell to Hall, whose shot took a touch off a City player before beating keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.
Haaland was not on the scoresheet but showed many other attributes to his game, and it was his measured cross that was met by O’Reilly, who directed his header past Pope.
City were nowhere near as effective as an attacking force after the break, but they defended doggedly when required and were always a threat on the counter-attack.
They now have 56 points from 27 games. Should Arsenal fail to beat Tottenham on Sunday, City will feel they have the title race firmly in their hands.
O’Reilly said he was “over the moon” about the goals and three points.
“The win was the most important thing: close the gap and apply as much pressure as possible,” he told TNT Sports.
“Very happy with the two goals. It is a dream of mine to win [the Premier League].”
Asked if City, unbeaten in eight games, can win the title, he added: “Yeah, definitely. We always believe we can win games.”
Elsewhere on Saturday, Aston Villa’s faint Premier League title hopes suffered a blow as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Leeds United, and Chelsea’s top-four ambitions were damaged when they dropped two points against relegation-bound Burnley.
Anton Stach’s stunning 31st-minute free kick past Emiliano Martinez looked like giving Leeds a vital victory at Villa Park, but substitute Tammy Abraham levelled late on.
Chelsea moved above Manchester United into fourth spot on goal difference, but it felt like two points dropped for the second week running as they drew 1-1 with Burnley at home.
Joao Pedro put Chelsea ahead, but the hosts were reduced to 10 men when Wesley Fofana received a second yellow card and Burnley equalised in stoppage time through Zian Flemming.
Brighton’s James Milner broke the Premier League appearance record in their 2-0 win at Brentford.
The 40-year-old former Manchester City and Liverpool player made his 654th appearance to go past Gareth Barry.
West Ham had the opportunity to really put some pressure on Nottingham Forest and Spurs in the relegation battle, but played out a turgid draw with visiting Bournemouth. It was the sixth successive Premier League stalemate between the sides.

Journalists identify more than 186,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine
The information comes from a joint report by the BBC Russian Service, Mediazona, and a team of volunteers, utilizing open data, according to Ukrinform.
Over the past month, the number of confirmed names has increased by almost 20,000, which is a record increase. However, as the study's authors emphasize, the increase in deaths is not related to the current situation on the front lines.
It is noted that the proportion of volunteers among the dead continues to grow: They now account for 33% of confirmed losses. More than half of all identified volunteers have died in the last year and a half.
The methodology for calculating the figures is based on an analysis of public reports, including obituaries, social media posts, and missing-person announcements. The actual number of casualties may be much higher.
According to Ukrinform, based on data from the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the total combat losses of Russian troops from February 24, 2022, to February 21, 2026, in the war against Ukraine amount to approximately 1,258,890 soldiers.

Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage

Someone was shot outside my building. It feels like a macabre rite of passage
Washington: Hello from a pungent Washington, DC, home of the sewage-filled Potomac River.
A few days ago, I joined an unfortunate club – Australian correspondents in Washington, DC, who have come all too close to a fatal shooting.
I had only been in my new apartment a week when an email lobbed from building management notifying me of an “emerging situation across the street” involving police and emergency services.
The incident occurred at 2.15pm on a Friday, while I was at work. By the time I got home that night, all traces of the emergency had disappeared.
But the next day, I learnt there had been a fatal shooting. The DC Metropolitan Police said the victim was 22-year-old Nehemia Jamaane Williams, a local, who was found inside a car, and died in hospital from his injuries. Police were appealing for information. No arrests had been made.
Welcome to the neighbourhood, I guess. My new place is only a few blocks from where Matthew Cranston, a former Washington correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, witnessed a shooting inside a crowded McDonald’s in September 2022.
And that was just metres from where a 15-year-old boy was shot dead a few months earlier, near the apartment building where my predecessor as North America correspondent, Farrah Tomazin, lived.
Those incidents occurred amid a post-COVID-19 pandemic crime wave that rocked the US capital and many American cities. It is partly why President Donald Trump sent the National Guard into Washington last year, even though rates of violent crime were already falling.
The fatal shooting outside my building – in broad daylight – was the seventh homicide in DC this year. The eighth came a few nights later in the Navy Yard neighbourhood south of Capitol Hill. And yet, there has been a 68 per cent decrease in the number of homicides so far this year compared to last year.
“We have one of the safest cities in the world,” Trump said on Wednesday (Washington time) at an event for Black History Month, as he welcomed to the stage Felicia Cook, whose grandson was killed during a violent encounter in 2017. “Now you can walk down the street, and you have nothing to fear.”
Trump regularly overstates the case with grand statements about how Washington now has “zero” crime, and how once-empty restaurants are now filled to bursting. “You can be with your child, with your loved one, with your lover,” he said last month. “Your lover’s not going to be killed any more, so you can act like a real lover.”
It’s difficult to take those statements seriously when someone’s shot dead on your doorstep. But, broadly speaking, we have to – because violent crime is down dramatically, not just in DC, but around the country.
The Council on Criminal Justice reported homicides were down 21 per cent in 2025 from 2024, based on data from 35 major US cities. That was 922 fewer homicides.
Furthermore, the council said that when national data was reported by the FBI later this year, there was a strong possibility that the murder rate would drop to 4 per 100,000 residents.
“That would be the lowest rate ever recorded in law enforcement or public health data going back to 1900, and would mark the largest single-year percentage drop in the homicide rate on record,” the council said.
The White House chalked this up as a major victory for Trump’s tough-on-crime agenda, compared to what it called Joe Biden’s “defund the police era”.
In reality, violent crime fell across the board, not just in cities where Trump mobilised the National Guard or cracked down on illegal immigrants. Homicides fell 40 per cent in Washington, DC, but they also fell by the same proportion in Denver and Omaha, and by more than 20 per cent in cities from Atlanta to Dallas to New York.
This is all a good thing. Trump may be overstating his contribution to a trend that was already under way when he took office, but he has also rightly seized on the fact that most Americans want and need relief from violent crime.
Of course, a serious attempt to reduce that harm would involve changing the country’s gun laws. But that is not on the cards.
One thing you come to understand quickly in the United States is the complicated nature of attitudes to guns. It’s not just redneck Republicans who cling to their weapons: last week in Washington, my group had a long debate with an otherwise very progressive bartender who was set on her right to bear arms.
DC is much safer than it was last year, and the year before that, and that’s welcome. Thanks, Mr President. But let’s not pretend all is fixed.

We will halve disadvantage gap in schools, ministers say in landmark education reforms
The government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding as part of an attempt to tackle the gap in achievement between pupils from poorer backgrounds compared with their more affluent peers

Ministers will set a target to halve the disadvantage gap by the time children born under this government finish secondary school, as part of a plan to improve the education system in England.
To tackle the achievement gap between pupils from poorer backgrounds and their more affluent peers, the government will reform how schools get targeted disadvantage funding.
The Schools White Paper, set to be published in full on Monday, will also set out two new programmes to tackle the performance of disadvantaged pupils locally in the North East and on the coast.
It comes after details of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) reforms also forming part of the white paper were leaked on Thursday.
It has been reported that from 2029, EHCPs (education, health and care plan) will be reassessed once children reach the end of primary school, proposals which sparked concern from disability charity Sense who warned that reassessments could increase instability for children and young people.
An EHCP is a legally binding document in the UK for children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities that require more support than is normally available in school.
The reforms are expected to introduce a plan with legal footing for all children with Send called Individual Support Plans (ISPs).
Speaking about plans to halve the attainment gap, education secretary Bridget Phillipson said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our Schools White Paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
In the latest GCSE results, the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to figures from the Department for Education (DfE).
It had previously narrowed from 4.07 in 2011 to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between. It then widened again post-pandemic to the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94 in 2022/23.
The government will also set a new target for attendance to recover 20 million school days a year by the end of 2028/29 compared with 2023/24.
Instead of targeting disadvantage funding based on whether a child is eligible to receive free school meals (FSM), after a consultation, distribution of funding to schools could take into account how low family income is, how long this has been the case, and the place a child lives.
It would also remove the need for families to choose to take up free school meals to be eligible for deprivation funding, in an attempt to cut admin for schools.
The two new programmes, Mission North East and Mission Coastal – will aim to tackle poorer performance for disadvantaged pupils in the areas, including white working-class pupils.
It will be based on the model of the London Challenge, a programme which was introduced to improve schools in London under the Labour government in 2003.
The White Paper will also set out how incentives worth up to £15,000 for newly appointed headteachers to work in parts of the country that need heads.
It will further include a commitment to develop minimum expectations for schools around how they communicate with parents and manage pupils’ transition from primary to secondary school.
The Schools White Paper was originally set to be published in autumn 2025, but was delayed to allow a further period to test Send reforms.

Ministers to set out plans to halve attainment gap in England’s schools

Plans to halve the attainment gap between the poorest pupils in England and their more affluent peers will be set out by the government on Monday.
The schools white paper will detail proposals to change the criteria under which schools receive funding to support the most disadvantaged students.
Disadvantage funding is now allocated based on how many pupils at a school receive free school meals – generally available to children from families with an annual income of less than £7,400.
Labour wants to broaden this criteria, overhauling the funding formula to give greater weight to funding pupils based on family income.
The policy is likely to shift funding for disadvantage payments away from the annual pupil premium payments given to schools for each child eligible for free school meals.
The white paper will also include controversial proposals for local authorities to be able to administer groups of schools through their own multiacademy trusts, and set new minimum expectations for schools to engage with parents.
The “disadvantage gap is as stark today as it was over a decade ago”, Labour said, with only 44% of children in receipt of free school meals achieving a pass of grade 4 or above in GCSE maths and English. This compares with 70% of children who do not qualify for free school meals, the party added.
Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success – one that we must seize.
“Our schools have made great strides in recent decades. Yet for too long, many children in our country have been let down by a one-size-fits-all system, denied opportunity because they’re poor or because they have additional needs.
“Our schools white paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.”
At present, disadvantage funding for schools costs about £8bn a year. There is no guarantee the pot would be increased to reflect the proposed changes, with government sources saying this would be determined at the next spending review.
Some MPs and campaigners have questioned how effective these proposed reforms will be without more guaranteed funding.
Munira Wilson, the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: “Basing funding on income alone risks hard-wiring regional inequalities into the system.
“Instead of reshuffling a fixed pot of money – risking new cliff edges that will leave struggling families even worse off – ministers must restore the pupil premium to its 2015 real-terms value.
“Starmer must also guarantee that any investment will rise with inflation, so no child is left without the support they need.”
Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We very much agree with the provision of more targeted funding for schools supporting the most disadvantaged children and have advocated for such a measure for several years.
“However, it is vital that this is done through additional investment into the education system, rather than distributing the same pot of money in a different way, with the risk of creating winners and losers.”
The white paper will also outline plans for two new programmes – Mission North East and Mission Coastal – to tackle the performances of deprived pupils in certain parts of the country. The Guardian understands the precise locations for these initiatives have yet to be decided.
They will be based on the London Challenge, a New Labour project aimed at driving up attainment in secondary schools in the capital that focused on schools working together to share learning and ideas. It was praised by Ofsted for helping to improve educational standards.
The government is also planning a radical overhaul of the special educational needs (Send) system as part of its plans. It plans to give every child with Send an individual support plan.
However, some Labour MPs are thought to be nervous about some of the plans, particularly whether parents will retain the right to appeal if they are unhappy with the level of support their child is receiving.
The white paper was originally due to be published last autumn, but was delayed to allow for further consideration of the Send proposals.
Ministers are also expected to announce new attendance targets in an effort to recover 20m lost school days a year.
It will propose pay rises for newly appointed headteachers to incentivise them to work in parts of the country where the need is greatest. This could be worth up to £15,000 to individual teachers.

Pakistan carries out strikes against terrorist targets on Afghan border

Pakistan has said it carried out strikes along the Afghanistan border to target terrorists it blames for recent attacks.
Pakistani forces reportedly carried out air strikes in several areas of eastern and southeastern Afghanistan on Sunday, according to Afghan local media and the Pakistani Ministry of Information.
Islamabad did not say precisely in which areas the strikes were carried out or provide details but cited three terrorist attacks since the start of Ramadan last week in Pakistan as the reason for carrying out the strikes.
In comments before dawn Sunday, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that the military conducted what he described as “intelligence-based, selective operations” against seven camps belonging to Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and its affiliates.
He said an affiliate of the Daesh group was also targeted in the border region.
In October, Pakistan also conducted strikes deep inside Afghanistan to target terrorist hideouts.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates the Interim Afghan Government to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan, as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost,” the ministry added.
The strikes came in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, it said.
“Sources told TOLO News that following the air strikes in Khogyani district, Nangarhar province, Pakistani forces also carried out strikes in the province’s Ghani Khel district, Nangarhar province, and Behsud district, Nangarhar province,” the Afghan news channel TOLO News wrote on X.
Afghanistan vows ‘appropriate, measured response’
The Defence Ministry of Afghanistan said on Sunday it would meet the Pakistani strikes on its soil with an “appropriate and measured response” at a “suitable time.”
The ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest possible terms" on US social media company X, describing them as a clear violation of national sovereignty, international law, principles of good neighborliness and Islamic values.
It said targeting civilian and religious centres demonstrates the Pakistani military’s intelligence and security shortcomings, and "such repeated acts of aggression will never be able to conceal their internal shortcomings.
Afghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid posted on X that Pakistan bombed Nangarhar and Paktika provinces but alleged that casualties were civilians, even though he did not specify the number or nature of casualties.
No confirmed information has been released so far regarding possible casualties.
Pakistan vowed to avenge the killing of two security personnel on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the suicide bombing in a mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago, warning that it would not allow any attack launched from Afghanistan to go unanswered.
Pakistan has accused neighbouring Afghanistan of sheltering TTP terrorists and of being responsible for a surge in cross-border attacks, a claim which Afghanistan denied.
The Pakistani government has urged the Afghan government to dismantle the alleged sanctuaries of the TTP terrorist group inside Afghanistan.
According to Pakistani military officials, more than 500 people, including over 311 soldiers, were killed in attacks, largely carried out by the TTP, last year.
Pakistan’s foreign ministry also summoned on Friday an Afghan diplomat over a recent terrorist attack in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border that killed 11 soldiers.

5 bodies of migrants washed ashore in east of Libya's capital Tripoli, police officer says

TRIPOLI, Feb 21 - At least five bodies of migrants including two women have been washed ashore in َQasr al-Akhyar, a coastal town in the east of Libya's capital Tripoli, a police officer told Reuters on Saturday.
Hassan Al-Ghawil, head of investigations at the Qasr Al-Akhyar police station, said that according to people in the area, a child's body washed ashore and because of the waves' height the body returned to the sea, and the coast guard was asked to search for it.
Ghawil said the bodies are all dark-skinned people. The bodies were found on Emhamid Al-Sharif shore in the western part of the town by people who reported to the police station.
Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean since the fall in 2011 of dictator Muammar Gaddafi to a NATO-backed uprising. Factional conflict has split the country into western and eastern factions since 2014.
Qasr al-Akhyar is a coastal town some 73 kilometers (45 miles) east of Tripoli.
Pictures were posted on the internet, and also seen by Reuters, showing the bodies of the migrants lying on the shore, where some were still within black inflatable lifebuoys.
"We reported to the Red Crescent to recover the bodies," said Ghawil. "The bodies we found are still intact and we think there are more bodies to wash ashore."
Earlier this month, fifty-three migrants, including two babies, were dead or missing after a rubber boat carrying 55 people capsized off the coast of Zuwara town in western Tripoli, the International Organization for Migration said.
Last week, a U.N. report said migrants in Libya, including young girls, are at risk of being killed, tortured, raped or put into domestic slavery, calling for a moratorium on the return of migrant boats to the country until human rights are ensured. REUTERS

Islamic State claims two attacks on Syrian army, announces ‘new phase’ of operations
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Feb 21 for two attacks targeting Syrian army personnel in northern and eastern Syria, as the militant group signalled what it described as a new phase of operations against the country’s leadership
The militant group said on its Dabiq news agency that it had targeted “an individual of the apostate Syrian regime” in the city of Mayadin in Deir al-Zor province using a pistol, and attacked two other personnel with machine guns in the northern city of Raqqa.
Syria’s Defence Ministry said in a statement that a Syrian army soldier and a civilian were killed on Feb 21 by “unknown assailants.” A military source told Reuters the soldier belonged to the army’s 42nd Division.
The attacks come amid a sharp escalation by ISIS against Syria’s leadership under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda leader who broke with the group in 2016 before leading a coalition of Islamist factions that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024.
On the evening of Feb 21, ISIS released a recorded statement by its spokesperson, Abu Hudhayfa al-Ansari, who said Syria had “moved from Iranian occupation to Turkish-American occupation.”
The group said it had begun a “new phase of operations” in Syria, describing Mr Sharaa as a “watchdog” of the global coalition and vowing that his fate would be no different from that of Mr Assad.
Mr Sharaa signed Syria’s accession to the global coalition
The latest incidents come two days after IS claimed responsibility for another attack in Deir al-Zor that killed a member of the Interior Ministry’s internal security forces and wounded another.
Several social media accounts and Telegram channels supporting ISIS have in recent hours called for intensified attacks using motorcycles and firearms.
ISIS has carried out six attacks against Syrian government targets since the fall of Assad.
A report by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism released last week said Mr Sharaa and two senior Cabinet ministers had been targeted in five foiled assassination attempts by ISIS. REUTERS

Attacks on Sudan healthcare facilities killed 69 this year
Five attacks on healthcare facilities have killed dozens of people in Sudan since the beginning of the year, the WHO said Saturday, as the war nears the start of its fourth year.
The fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has dismantled an already fragile medical system, with more than a third of facilities currently out of service.
"During the first 50 days of 2026, five attacks on health care have already been recorded in Sudan, killing 69 people and injuring 49," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.
On Sunday a hospital was targeted in the southeastern state of Sennar, leaving three patients dead and seven people wounded, including an employee, Tedros said.
In three other attacks early this month, more than 30 people were killed when medical centres were targeted in South Kordofan, a vast region south of the capital Khartoum that is currently a focus of the fighting.
The WHO has confirmed at least 206 attacks on healthcare facilities since the start of the war in April 2023, resulting in the deaths of around 2,000 people and injuries to several hundred.
Last year alone, 65 attacks killed more than 1,620 people, accounting for 80 percent of all deaths worldwide linked to attacks on the medical sector, according to the WHO.
Since it broke out, Sudan's civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and forced 11 million to flee their homes, triggering what the UN says is one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
According to the WHO, the country is facing multiple disease outbreaks, notably cholera, malaria, dengue and measles, in addition to malnutrition.
Some 4.2 million cases of acute malnutrition are expected to arise in Sudan this year, including more than 800,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, the WHO chief said earlier this month.
Around 33 million people will be left without humanitarian aid in 2026, with the United Nations warning in January that its aid stocks could run out by the end of March.

Venezuela receives more than 1,500 amnesty requests under new law

Venezuela receives more than 1,500 amnesty requests under new law
More than 370 political prisoners have already been granted amnesty under the US-backed legislation.
More than 1,5000 political prisoners in Venezuela have applied for amnesty under a new law that came into effect just a few days ago, according to the head of the country’s legislature.
“A total of 1,557 cases are being addressed immediately, and hundreds of people deprived of their freedom are already being released under the amnesty law”, National Assembly chief Jorge Rodriguez told a news conference on Saturday.

- list 3 of 3IMF warns Venezuela’s economy and humanitarian situation is ‘quite fragile’
Rodriguez’s announcement comes two days after the country’s legislature unanimously adopted a landmark amnesty law.
Amnesty is not automatic under the law: petitioners must ask the court handling their cases.
On Friday, the lawmaker overseeing the amnesty process, Jorge Arreaza, announced that prosecutors had asked courts to free 379 prisoners. They include opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
So far, 80 prisoners have been freed, Rodriguez told the AFP news agency on Saturday. All of those released had been detained in the capital, Caracas, he said, without offering further details.
Further releases could be granted within 15 days, said Arreaza.
Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, the sister of the top lawmaker, pushed for the United States-backed legislation after she rose to power following the US’s abduction of leftist leader Nicolas Maduro during a military raid on January 3.
The legislation’s approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who have for decades denied holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes.
During its signing, Rodriguez said the law showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela”.
However, opposition figures have criticised the new legislation, which appears to include carve-outs for some offences previously used by authorities to target Maduro’s political opponents.
Human rights organisations are also calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of rights group Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence”.
The law explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for “promoting” or “facilitating… armed or forceful actions” against Venezuela’s sovereignty by foreign actors.
Delcy Rodriguez has levelled such accusations against opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado, who hopes, at some point, to return to Venezuela from the US.
Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of Machado, had a house arrest order against him lifted, his brother, lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, told the Reuters news agency late on Thursday.
The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of “terrorism”-related activities.
But the amnesty extends to 11,000 political prisoners who, over nearly three decades, were paroled or placed under house arrest.
“The law provides for those substitute measures to be lifted so that these people can enjoy full freedom”, Rodriguez told reporters.
Outside a national police facility in Caracas known as Zone 7, relatives – some of whom have been on site for weeks – waited patiently.
“Let’s hope it’s true,” Genesis Rojas told AFP.
A group of relatives who have been camped out for days chanted: “We want to go home!”
Hundreds have already been granted conditional release by Rodriguez’s government since the deadly US raid that resulted in Maduro’s capture.
Maduro and his wife are in US custody awaiting trial. He has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges and declared that he was a “prisoner of war.”

Finland win Olympic bronze in ice hockey with 6–1 victory over Slovakia

Finland secured Olympic bronze in men’s ice hockey with a 6–1 victory over Slovakia in Saturday’s medal match, sealing the country’s eighth Olympic medal in the sport.
The win marked Finland’s fifth bronze and continued a run of podium finishes in tournaments featuring NHL players. In six such Olympic events, Finland have claimed five medals.
The teams had met in the opening group match, when Slovakia won 4–1. This time Finland controlled the decisive stages and scored four times in the third period to settle the contest.
Sebastian Aho opened the scoring at 7:27 of the first period, finishing a play set up by Artturi Lehkonen and Miro Heiskanen. Finland led 1–0 after the opening twenty minutes.
Erik Haula doubled the advantage at 28:05 in the second period, assisted by Joel Armia and Eeli Tolvanen. Slovakia responded late in the period when Tomas Tatar scored at 39:30 to cut the deficit to 2–1.
The game turned early in the third period. With Slovakia pressing for an equaliser, Finland earned a power play. Roope Hintz redirected a point shot at 48:27 to restore a two-goal lead. Heiskanen and Tolvanen recorded assists.
Less than a minute later, Kaapo Kakko extended the lead to 4–1 with a wrist shot from space in the slot. Slovakia struggled to recover after conceding twice in quick succession.
Slovakia withdrew goaltender Samuel Hlavaj in the closing minutes in search of a comeback. Armia scored into the empty net at 55:32 after receiving the puck from Hintz. Haula added his second of the night at 58:42, also into an empty net, with Armia and Rasmus Ristolainen providing assists.
Haula finished with two goals. Armia recorded one goal and two assists. Hintz scored once and added an assist. Heiskanen and Tolvanen each contributed two assists.
Juuse Saros made 30 saves for Finland. Hlavaj stopped 29 shots for Slovakia.
Finland captain Mikael Granlund left the ice in the third period after hitting his head against the boards during a shift. He removed his helmet and went to the dressing room following a discussion with medical staff. According to Yle’s live coverage, Granlund later returned to the bench for the post-match handshakes and continued talks with the team doctor.
The bronze medal represents Finland’s first men’s major tournament medal since the 2022 World Championship title. The country previously won Olympic gold in Beijing and silver in Turin in 2006 and Calgary in 1988.
Saturday’s result concludes the men’s tournament at the Milano-Cortina Winter Games weekend with Finland returning home with a place on the podium.

Slovakia Marks 8 Years Since the Murder of Journalist Ján Kuciak and his Fiancée

Reported by
Hundreds of people gathered in Bratislava and other cities across Slovakia on Saturday to mark the eighth anniversary of the killings of investigative reporter Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, in a case that shook the country but still lacks a final answer about who ordered their deaths.
The murders on Feb. 21, 2018, were carried out by gunman Miroslav Marček, who shot Kuciak twice in the chest and Kušnírová once in the head, while an accomplice, Tomáš Szabó, waited nearby, prosecutors said.
Both men are serving 25-year prison sentences. Authorities say they acted on instructions relayed by intermediary Zoltán Andruskó, who confessed and received a 15-year term.
Yet the central question — who commissioned the assassination — remains unresolved, leaving one of Europe’s most consequential journalist murder cases without closure.
Prosecutors allege that businessman Marian Kočner ordered the killing through an associate, Alena Zsuzsová, who then tasked Andruskó. Courts have twice acquitted Kočner and once convicted Zsuzsová, but each verdict has been overturned on appeal, effectively resetting the case.
The retrial, now underway at the Specialized Criminal Court in Pezinok, follows a ruling last May by the Supreme Court of Slovakia that cited serious flaws in how earlier judges evaluated evidence. The high court said the panel had failed to address key facts and had not followed prior judicial instructions.
The new proceedings, which opened in January and are scheduled to run through December, also include charges tied to alleged plots against prosecutors. Two additional defendants — Dušan Kračina and Darko Dragić — are accused in those cases.
The killings prompted mass demonstrations in 2018 that helped topple a government and reshaped the country’s political landscape. Eight years on, the case remains a symbol of unresolved justice and the risks faced by investigative journalists.
At a commemorative gathering at Freedom Square, Kuciak’s father, Jozef Kuciak, told attendees, according to The Slovak Spectator: “Every day we live with pain; every day we go to the cemetery to light candles instead of raising our grandchildren.”
In a statement, Pavol Szalai of Reporters Without Borders urged judges to “duly examine” all evidence and rule independently, adding, “Europe’s eyes are on Slovakia.”
Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament, said the murders had “shaken Europe” and noted they came months after the killing of Daphne Caruana Galizia. “Their courage remains a beacon for journalists across the continent who risk everything to uncover the truth and safeguard our democracies,” she wrote on X.

CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, February 22. /TASS/. The Canadian national team won gold in men’s curling at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy after defeating in the final match Great Britain 9-6.
The Canadian Olympic gold medalists in curling are Brad Jacobs, Marc Kennedy, Brett Gallant and Tardi Tyler.
In the match for the bronze, the national team of Switzerland earlier confidently defeated Norway 9-1.
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026.

K-pop’s big freeze: are cracks in China’s cultural blockade a thaw?
A decade-long geopolitical chill has kept South Korean entertainers largely locked out of the Chinese market, but fans find ways to connect
While K-pop has conquered almost every corner of the globe, South Korea’s entertainment industry remains largely locked out of the Chinese market due to a geopolitical chill that has lingered for a decade.
In early January, the Chinese remake of the South Korean television series My Mister – featuring singer-actress IU – was released on the streaming platform Youku. The Chinese version, titled Loving Strangers, starred actors Mark Chao Yu-ting and Zhang Zifeng. Media reports noted that it was the first South Korean drama remake to be publicly distributed in China since the ban began.
Earlier this month, South Korean entertainment company CJ ENM partnered with JYP Entertainment’s Chinese subsidiary and Tencent Music Entertainment to launch Onecead, an artist management and music production company with a focus on the Chinese market.

Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
Crews recover bodies of 9 backcountry skiers days after California avalanche
TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) — Crews recovered the bodies of nine backcountry skiers who were killed by an avalanche in California’s Sierra Nevada, authorities said Saturday, concluding a harrowing operation that was hindered by intense snowfall.
A search team reached the bodies of eight victims and found one other who had been missing and presumed dead since Tuesday’s avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe. The ninth person who was missing was found “relatively close” to the other victims, according to Nevada County Sheriff’s Lt. Dennis Hack, but was impossible to see due to whiteout conditions at that time.
At a news conference, Sheriff Shannon Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies that helped recover the bodies — from the California Highway Patrol to the National Guard to the Pacific Gas & Electric utility company — and 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.
“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.
Victims named
The sheriff named for the first time the three guides from Blackbird Mountain Company who died: Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.
According to biographies on the company’s website, Alissandratos was originally from Tampa, Florida, and moved to Tahoe roughly a decade ago. He enjoyed a wide array of adventure activities, from backcountry exploration to rock climbing.
Henry moved to Colorado in 2016 and then to Truckee three years later. He was described as “laid back” and devoted to sharing his knowledge and love of the mountains with others.
There was no bio for Choo on the website.
“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” Blackbird Mountain founder Zeb Blais said Wednesday in a statement.
“We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much,” he said, “and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.”
The six other fatal victims were women who were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the Sierra Nevada wilderness, their families said this week.
They were identified as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, all in their 40s. They lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area.
“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement. “Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”
The families asked for privacy while they grieve and added that they “have many unanswered questions.”
Two of the friends got out alive and were rescued along with four others, including one guide, after Tuesday’s avalanche. Their names have not been released.
Stuck on the mountain for hours
The avalanche struck on the last day of the 15 skiers’ three-day tour, when the group decided to end the trip early to avoid the impending snowstorm. Officials have said the path they took is a “normally traveled route” but declined to specify what that meant.
At around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, the six survivors called for help, describing a sudden and terrifying slide that was approximately the length of a football field. In the aftermath they discovered the bodies of three fellow skiers, according to Hack.
Rescuers were not able to reach them until roughly six hours after the initial call for help, Hack said, and took two separate paths to arrive. They found five other bodies, leaving only one person unaccounted for.
But it was immediately clear to rescuers that it was too dangerous to extract the bodies at that time due to the heavy snowfall and threat of more avalanches. Those conditions persisted on Wednesday and Thursday.
A breakthrough on Friday
Authorities used two California Highway Patrol helicopters, with the help of Pacific Gas & Electric Company, to break up the snow and intentionally release unstable snowpack to reduce the avalanche risk.
Crews were then able to recover five victims that evening before it got too dark to access the last three.
Rescuers used helicopters and ropes to hoist the last four bodies from the mountain the following morning, fighting through severe winds that forced them to make multiple trips. The bodies were then taken to snowcats — trucks that are outfitted to drive on snow — for further transport.
“We cannot say enough how tremendously sorry we are for the families that have been affected by this avalanche,” Moon said.
Initial reports indicated that at least two of the surviving skiers were not swept away by the avalanche, Hack said. The others were standing separately and relatively close together and were hit.
Hack declined to offer information about what might have set off the avalanche.
Authorities close the area
The terrain will be off-limits to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest. Officials intended to restore public access once the investigation is complete.
“This is the public’s land, and they love to recreate on it,” Feutrier said. “The Forest Service doesn’t close public land for every hazard or every obstacle. We trust the American people to use their best judgment when recreating.”

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal

Kaillie Humphries Armbruster of U.S. wins record-tying sixth Olympic bobsled medal; Germany's Laura Nolte takes gold
American Kaillie Humphries Armbruster, in perhaps her Olympic bobsled finale, found her way to the medal stand for a record-tying sixth time Saturday in the two-woman bobsled, while Germany's Laura Nolte won gold again.
Nolte is now the back-to-back two-woman Olympic bobsled champion, holding off teammate Lisa Buckwitz to grab gold at the Milan Cortina Games on Saturday night.
Nolte — the winner of the last four World Cup two-woman titles — cemented her status as the sport's current queen, teaming with Deborah Levi to win her second consecutive two-woman gold medal by finishing four runs in 3 minutes, 48.46 seconds.
Buckwitz, with Neele Schuten in her sled, was second in 3:48.99. Humphries Armbruster and Jasmine Jones — two mothers in the same sled for the U.S. — finished third in 3:49.21. It was the sixth Olympic medal for Humphries Armbruster, tying fellow American Elana Meyers Taylor for the most by any woman in the sport's history.
Also for the U.S., Kaysha Love — who has been dealing with a hamstring issue for much of the season and had it flare up again in Italy — and Azaria Hill finished fifth in 3:49.71. Meyers Taylor and Jadin O'Brien, who were doomed by a second-heat skid at the top of the track Friday night, got a few spots back in the standings Saturday and finished tied for seventh in 3:50.49.
Germany now has six bobsled medals in these Olympics, while the U.S. has three and the rest of the world has zero. The divide might get bigger on Sunday in the final sliding event of the Milan Cortina Games; Germany, which already swept the two-man race, is in position to do the same thing in four-man after Saturday's opening two heats of that competition.
And Germany is now up to 17 sliding medals, counting bobsled, skeleton and luge, at Milan Cortina — one more than the rest of the world. Austria has five, the U.S. now has four along with Italy, Britain has two and Latvia has one.
The two-woman race was basically for the bronze going into the final run.
Nolte — who had the lead, albeit a much smaller one, going into the final heat of the monobob competition that Meyers Taylor ended up winning — led Buckwitz by 0.35 seconds going into the last heat. Buckwitz's lead over Humphries Armbruster was 0.19 seconds, and Humphries Armbruster was only 0.09 seconds up on Germany's Kim Kalicki in the race for the bronze.
Kalicki's final time: 3:49.36. It wasn't enough to catch Humphries Armbruster, who hopped out of the sled and wrapped herself and Jones in the American flag, knowing the medal was theirs.
Humphries Armbruster's updated Olympic medal count: three golds, three bronzes.
Meyers Taylor is 41, Humphries Armbruster is 40. Meyers Taylor is a mother of two, Humphries Armbruster has one son, and both women are talking about how they would like to add another baby to their families.
That means Saturday night might have been the last on the Olympic stage for them — and maybe on any sliding stage.
It was the 177th race — counting World Cups, world championships, the short-lived monobob World Series and the Olympics — for Meyers Taylor at the major international level. She has 78 medals from those races, six of them coming in the Olympics, and was a winner either as a driver or pusher in three different decades.
And for Humphries Armbruster, who won three Olympic medals for Canada and now has three more for the U.S., the numbers are even more gaudy: 105 medals in 218 major international races, with 49 of them victories.
If this is the end, for either or for both of them, what a ride it was.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 per cent on Feb 21, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Feb 20’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
Shortly after the court’s 6-3 ruling that rejected the president’s authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Mr Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their “disloyalty” and calling them “fools and lap dogs.”
Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist under heavy security
Thousands of people marched in south-eastern France on Feb 21 under heavy security in tribute to a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge.
The crowd – many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks – marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, “justice for Quentin” and “the extreme left kills”.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
US citizen shot and killed by federal immigration agent last year, records show
A federal immigration agent shot and killed a US citizen in Texas in March 2025, months before the Trump administration began its deportation surge in Minnesota that led to the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, according to records released this week.
Mr Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, was killed by agents with the Department of Homeland Security, attorneys for Mr Martinez's family said in a statement.
A DHS agent fired multiple rounds at Mr Martinez, who allegedly hit another DHS agent with his car as the agents assisted local police in South Padre Island, Texas, with traffic control following an accident on March 15, 2025, according to records obtained by American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog group. The agents were conducting immigration enforcement, the records show.
Political drama Yellow Letters wins Golden Bear at Berlin film festival
Yellow Letters, directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Golden Bear for best film at the Berlin Film Festival on Feb 21 in a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza which has dogged 2026’s edition of the event.
A political drama, Catak’s film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Jury president Wim Wenders called the film “a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well”.
Chelsea, Aston Villa held in blow to Champions League hopes
Burnley dented Chelsea’s chances of Champions League qualification by snatching a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, while Aston Villa also struck late to salvage a point against Leeds on Feb 21.
The Blues climb into the Premier League’s top four only on goal difference after they paid for failing to build on Joao Pedro’s fourth-minute opener.
Chelsea were dominant until Wesley Fofana was sent off with 18 minutes remaining for a second yellow card.

US ambassador says Israel has right to much of Middle East, sparking uproar
Mike Huckabee’s comments were condemned by Arab and Muslim nations as ‘extremist rhetoric’
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said Israel has a right to much of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments in an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired on Friday. Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include essentially the entire Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” Huckabee added, however, that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands”.

Norwegian star breaks Olympic record with sixth Milano Cortina gold

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo becomes first athlete to win six gold medals at one Winter Olympics
In short:
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo has become the first athlete to win six gold medals at a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo passed the previous record of five set by USA's Eric Heiden at the 1980 Lake Placid Games.
Klæbo now has 11 Olympic gold medals, sitting behind only American swim icon Michael Phelps (23) for most ever.
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klæbo completed his historic gold medal sweep of the men's cross-country skiing events by winning his sixth race and setting the record for the most golds by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics.
Klæbo's victory in the 50-kilometre mass start race shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speed skater Eric Heiden, who won five golds in the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics.
All of Heiden's wins were in individual races and two of Klæbo's have come in team events, so Heiden's record for individual wins still stands.
"It feels amazing," Klæbo said. "To crown everything here with a 50K, it's unbelievable. In Norway, we say that if you're gonna become a man, you need to win the 50K and today we did, so it's a perfect way to end two perfect weeks."
The solid gold performance matched the feat he accomplished at last year's world championships in Trondheim, Norway, when he won all six events.
Klæbo's teammates, Martin Løwstrøm Nyenget, took silver, and Emil Iversen won bronze in a Norwegian sweep.
The three Norwegians had a lead before the halfway mark and continued to build the gap on their chasers.
Nyenget drove a fast pace, trying the entire race to shake his compatriot, knowing that if he didn't, he'd fall victim to Klæbo's trademark uphill sprint.
Klaebo said he was just trying to hang on and conserve energy for the finish.
Toward the end, Nyenget and Klæbo pushed uphill and dropped Iversen. Klæbo stayed in second waiting to launch his winning move.
As the two reached the final hill, Klæbo ran away from Nyenget.
As he glided toward the finish, he pointed his fingers toward the sky, took one stride across the line, toppled over on his right hip and rolled onto his back. He finished in 2:06:44.8.
Nyenget finished 8.9 seconds later and Iversen was 30.7 seconds behind.
"I went hard from the start, so I managed to get rid of everyone else, but the best," Nyenget said. "So I'm really happy about my performance, but Johannes is the king."
France's Theo Schely finished fourth, nearly three minutes back and Savelii Korostelev, a Russian competing as an individual neutral athlete, finished fifth at 3:38.3 back.
The highest-placed US skier was Gus Schumacher, who won a silver in a team relay, in 13th place.
Five skiers, including Iivo Niskanen of Finland and Harald Oestberg Amundsen of Norway, dropped out of the race and 14 competitors were lapped.
The win extends Klæbo's record for most career Winter Olympic gold medals to 11 over three Games. The previous record had been eight, which Klæbo broke on February 15.
Klæbo has the second-most Olympic golds overall behind only US swimming great Michael Phelps, who has 23.
The win gave Norway a record 18th gold medal and further increased their lead in the total medal count in these games to 40 overall, also a Winter Olympics record, though the 116 medal events this year is more than in the past.
The country set the record on Friday for the most gold medals won by a nation at a single Winter Olympics when biathlete Johannes Dale-Skjevdal won the 15-kilometre mass start race.

Syrian govt takes over management of airport held by Kurds
Syrian authorities have taken over management of Qamishli airport as part of an ongoing process to integrate Kurdish-led forces and institutions into the national government, state media reported Saturday.
The SANA news agency, citing the General Authority of Civil Aviation and Air Transport, said officials had toured the facility on Saturday after assuming control and "discussed mechanisms to restart its operations".
The head of the authority, Omar al-Husari, said on X that taking over the airport was "an important institutional step in the process of unifying the management of airports under the umbrella of the state".
The Kurds - who controlled much of northeast Syria before striking the integration deal under military pressure from the government - had taken over the airport following the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad just over a year ago.
While it was not open to civilian flights, Russia had used part of the facility as a base before withdrawing last month.
Qamishli is the only airport in northeastern Syria, and for years served as a lifeline for the region's residents, particularly during nearly 14 years of civil war beginning in 2011, during which there were regular flights between it and Damascus.
The airport had remained under the government's control during the war, and continued to receive flights up until Assad's overthrow.
In November 2019, Russian forces turned the airport into a military base to oversee the implementation of an agreement that followed Turkey's large-scale offensive against Kurdish fighters.

Aid to Ukrainians in Poland must be responsible, not chaotic – Marshal of Sejm
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by the Marshal of the Polish Sejm, Włodzimierz Czarzasty, commenting on the adoption of a law introducing new rules for the stay of Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
According to Czarzasty, since 2022, Poland has made tremendous efforts: within the framework of Official Development Assistance (ODA), support for Ukraine and its refugees “is measured in billions of zlotys.”
He noted that further decisions will be adapted to the legal situation and to EU-level regulations.
“Our goal is stability, legal residence, and integration for those who work and pay taxes here. Assistance cannot be chaotic; it must be responsible. My compatriots have proven that in a crisis, they know how to open their hearts and embrace friends in need. I would like peace in Ukraine to come as soon as possible. However, we do not know when that will happen, so we must somehow adapt to this dramatic situation,” emphasized the Marshal of the Sejm.
As reported, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki approved the termination of the 2022 special law on aid to Ukrainian citizens who had arrived after the full-scale Russian invasion. Key provisions of that law will be transferred to the law on providing protection for foreigners.
The new law will come into effect on March 5, 2026.
Currently, up to one million Ukrainian war refugees are in Poland.
According to the latest data, a total of 4.35 million people who had to leave Ukraine due to the war hold temporary protection status in the EU. In June 2025, the European Council decided to extend temporary protection for them for one year, starting March 4, 2026.

‘Absurd and provocative’: Huckabee faces firestorm for Israel border stance
Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and others denounce US ambassador’s remarks suggesting Israel has right to much of the Middle East.
United States Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has triggered an avalanche of criticism from Arab and Muslim countries after suggesting Israel has a right to expand its territory across a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee delivered the remarks during a sit-down interview with US commentator Tucker Carlson, broadcast on Friday, as he was pressed about the geographical borders of Israel.

Carlson asked Huckabee, a self-professed Christian Zionist and staunch supporter of Israel, to clarify his stance on the Biblical promise of the land spanning the area between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile River in Egypt to the descendants of Abraham, and if the modern Israeli state had the right to claim that lineage.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee.
Such territory would encompass modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia.
The US ambassador later appeared to walk back the claim, saying it was “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. He also said Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it currently holds.
‘Extremist rhetoric’
Huckabee’s comments sparked immediate backlash from neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them “extremist”, “provocative” and “not in line with Washington’s official position”.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable”, and called for the US Department of State to provide clarification.
Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the remarks a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
Jordan’s foreign ministry dismissed them as “absurd and provocative,” a violation of diplomatic norms and “an infringement on the sovereignty of states in the region”.
“Statements of this nature — extremist and lacking any sound basis — serve only to inflame sentiments and stir religious and national emotions”, the League of Arab States also said in a statement.
Huckabee, whom US President Donald Trump nominated as ambassador in 2024, has long opposed the idea of a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinian people, and denied the existence of an illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Back in 2008, Huckabee went so far as to question Palestinian identity altogether, saying, “There’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.”
In 2024, the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and must cease immediately.
But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.
The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory, and only since 2019, during Trump’s first term as president.
After its 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.
Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.

Opinion | Humans vs robots? China begs to disagree
As China embraces humanoid robots, policymakers and companies are expanding the scope of innovation and applications in daily life
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
The 2026 Spring Festival Gala, one of the world’s most-watched television events, featured a dazzling array of humanoid robots. They performed martial arts, executed intricate sword dances and even took part in a comedy skit alongside human celebrities.
While parts of the world still view humanoid robots with a mixture of fear and suspicion, as potential job-stealers or sci-fi villains, China is increasingly embracing them as partners in work, entertainment and daily life. Amid the escalating artificial intelligence (AI) race, China is not just competing on technological prowess but is rapidly outpacing others in its willingness to integrate these machines into public life.
China accounted for 90 per cent of the roughly 13,000 humanoid robots shipped globally last year. The country also represented over half of the humanoid robot exhibitors at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026. This burgeoning ecosystem draws researchers, engineers, entrepreneurs and investors into a fast-growing market.

It is fuelled by a parallel explosion in large language models and multi-modal AI, from ByteDance’s Doubao to the DeepSeek and Qwen models. Such AI models help robots understand user requests, engage in conversation, analyse data and provide useful content. As more robots are deployed in the physical world, the AI models are enhanced by the influx of real-world data, which in turn intensifies competition in large language models themselves and further encourages innovation.
The gala offered a stunning showcase of this progress. Robots from companies like Unitree, Galbot and Noetix ran, danced and performed acrobatics on stage. One might dismiss a backflipping robot, clad in a Monkey King costume, as a spectacle. But the nimbleness of the arms, legs, waist, neck, ankles and fingers shows technological breakthroughs.

Making body components that are flexible requires joint stability, space sensing and navigation, computer vision accuracy and skeleton durability. It demands seamless coordination between what Chinese engineers describe as the robot’s big brain – the higher-level AI for self-learning, planning and decision-making – and its small brain, which handles the movement and motor control needed for everything from walking and running to complex dexterous functions.

Is Iran stalling? Tehran floats flexibility as US signals strike readiness

Iran has sent another message to the US through Oman indicating it is prepared to show flexibility on its nuclear program, provided it is allowed to keep its uranium enrichment facilities and centrifuges on its own soil. Under the proposal, the facilities would not be activated until after an interim period and would operate under strict supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Tehran insists the enrichment would be for civilian purposes only.
According to Western sources familiar with the negotiations, the message followed US dissatisfaction with the Iranian proposal presented in Geneva. The new offer is being examined in Washington but is still far from meeting American demands. If Iran does not move closer to those requirements, the US is considering a series of limited strikes to prove the seriousness of the threat.
The same sources said some senior figures in the Iranian regime believe the US will ultimately refrain from attacking, despite the significant concentration of American forces in the region. Limited strikes, they assess, could send a message while avoiding a full scale conflict.
Details obtained by Israel Hayom indicate that part of the Geneva meeting was devoted to what participants described as a US reprimand of the Iranian delegation. Washington accused Tehran of violating its commitment to discuss all issues, including its ballistic missile program and support for its proxy terrorist organizations. Israel Hayom previously revealed that the first round of talks in Oman had been scheduled, in part, on the basis of an Iranian pledge to address those subjects as well.
However, in Oman the Iranian delegation announced it would agree to discuss those issues only after a nuclear agreement was reached and sanctions were lifted. In Geneva, Iranian officials reiterated that position and demanded that any talks on other matters take place without ultimatums and with the participation of regional countries, which they argue are relevant to the discussion. The US team rejected the demand and lodged a strong protest over what it described as a breach of prior understandings. Despite this outcome, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi issued a positive statement after the meeting, prompting contradictory briefings from US officials.
In Israel, officials assess that Iran will attempt to stall by floating additional proposals on the nuclear issue but will not be able to bridge the gaps with the US. "The spring is coiled, and the readiness of US forces for a full strike is high, but an order to proceed will not be given in the coming days," an Israeli source said.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the bank accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol, the latest development in a legal saga between the president and the nation’s biggest bank over the issue known as “debanking.”
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump’s lawsuit against the bank and its leader, Jamie Dimon. The president sued for $5 billion, alleging that his accounts were closed for political reasons, disrupting his business operations.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan’s former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan’s private bank and commercial bank.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president’s accounts in writing after Jan. 6. The bank would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for closing accounts, citing bank privacy laws.
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment beyond what the bank said in its legal filings.
Trump originally sued JPMorgan in Florida state court, where Trump’s primary residence is now located. The filings this week are part of an effort by JPMorgan Chase to have the case both moved from state to federal court and to have the jurisdiction of the case moved to New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump originally accused the bank of trade libel and violating state and federal unfair and deceptive trade practices.
In the original lawsuit, Trump said he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank sent him notices that JPMorgan would close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future. The blacklist has yet to be defined by the president’s lawyers.
“If and when Plaintiffs explain what they mean by this “blacklist,” JPMorgan will respond accordingly,” the bank’s lawyers said in a filing.
JPMorgan has previously said that while it regrets that Trump felt the need to sue the bank, the lawsuit has no merit.
The issue of debanking is at the center of the case. Debanking occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with conservative politicians arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement. “President Trump is standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion.”
Debanking first became a national issue when conservatives accused the Obama administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and other conservative figures have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since Trump came back into office, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked. The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. The case is ongoing.

Russian drones kill four people in Sumy region, including teenager
This was reported by Head of the Sumy Regional Military Administration Oleh Hryhorov on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
“A Russian drone killed four civilians. These were two brothers, one of them 17 years old, and a married couple. The woman was a medic,” he wrote.
According to the official, the enemy dropped an explosive device from a drone on the outskirts of the Znob-Novhorod community. The two brothers were injured in the explosion.
Medical personnel hospitalized the wounded. On the way to the hospital, the Russians deliberately targeted the ambulance with an attack drone.
“The vehicle caught fire. Only the driver survived. He is in the hospital with severe burns,” added Hryhorov.
As Ukrinform reported, throughout the previous day, five people were injured in the Sumy region as a result of enemy attacks.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate to 15 percent
President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."
Shortly after the court's 6-3 ruling that rejected the president's authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 economic emergency powers act, Trump had initially announced a new 10 percent global levy by invoking a different legal avenue.
At the same time, he launched an extraordinary personal attack on the conservative justices who had sided with the majority, slamming their "disloyalty" and calling them "fools and lap dogs."
The ruling was a stunning rebuke by the high court, which has largely sided with the president since he returned to office, and marked a major political setback in striking down Trump's signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.
Saturday's announcement is sure to provoke further uncertainty as Trump carries on with a trade war that has cajoled and punished countries, both friend and foe.
It is the latest move in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
The new duty by law is only temporary - allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.
On Friday, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
High court defeat
Friday's court ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminium, and various other goods. Government probes still underway could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
But it nevertheless marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs - Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee - thanking them "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
The president alleged the majority of six justices, including two nominated during his first term, had been "swayed by foreign interests."
"I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence," he said.
Shares on Wall Street - a metric closely watched by Trump - rose modestly Friday after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the Supreme Court's ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Kavanaugh noted the refund process could be a "mess."

Does Trump Have the Legal Authority to Strike Iran? An Expert Explains

After building up a massive military force in the Middle East over the last few weeks, President Donald Trump said Friday that he was considering strikes against Iran to pressure its leaders into accepting a deal on its nuclear program.
Trump has ratcheted up threats of action against the country’s leadership in recent months alongside a steady buildup of military forces. Two aircraft carriers are currently deployed, and one more—the USS Gerald Ford—is expected to arrive imminently.
When questioned by reporters on Friday whether he was weighing limited strikes against the country’s leadership in order to get it to accept a deal over its nuclear program, Trump replied: “I guess I can say I am considering that.”
Read More: Leavitt Says Iran Would Be ‘Wise to Make a Deal’ as Trump Escalates Military Buildup in Region
On Thursday, Trump gave Tehran a deadline of 10 to 15 days to finalize a deal to solve the nuclear dispute or face “really bad things.”
The United States joined an Israeli-led military operation against Iran in June last year that struck three of the country’s nuclear sites. After that operation, Trump claimed Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated.”
Trump raised the prospect of further military action against Iran following a brutal crackdown on protests there that killed thousands.
That prospect has drawn harsh criticism from inside and outside of the President’s own party.
Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican, and Rep. Ro Khanna said they would table a War Powers resolution to prohibit the president from ordering military action in Iran without congressional approval.
“Congress must vote on war according to our Constitution. Rep. Ro Khanna and I will be forcing that vote to happen in the House as soon as possible,” Massie wrote on X on Feb. 18. “I will vote to put America first which means voting against more war in the Middle East.”
David Janovsky, Acting Director of The Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight, answered TIME’s questions about the legality of potential strikes on Iran.
If Trump orders strikes on Iran tomorrow, however limited in scope, could that be legally justified?
DJ: The short answer is no. There's no indication that there's any sort of circumstance that would give the President the unilateral authority to order military action. It's true that presidents have some inherent authority to deploy the military as Commander in Chief, but that's really limited to true emergency circumstances where there is an attack underway that needs to be repelled, or maybe an extremely clear imminent attack. But there's no suggestion that that's the case today—that would make the strikes illegal.
What steps would the White House need to take for this military action to be legally above board?
DJ: Most simply, the administration would need to go to Congress. This is a contemplated attack against a sovereign state, and that, in simplest terms, is an act of war. And the Constitution gives the exclusive power to declare war to Congress, not the president. So this is something that would need a vote and congressional approval.
How would this operation be different from the strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites in June 2025, legally speaking?
DJ: My position is that those strikes in 2025 were not legally justifiable and also that strikes now would likewise not be justifiable. In 2025, the administration put out a very brief explanation that relied on both the President's inherent authority and a notion of collective self-defense with Israel. But again, self-defense is properly understood to involve a threat that is much more immediate than anything that's at play now.
What would be the legal and political implications if Congress passed a formal War Powers resolution restricting the President’s ability to strike Iran?
DJ: It's important to keep in mind that if Congress did nothing, that would be a sign that Congress didn't approve an act of war, and so it would be illegal.
So, congressional action isn't necessary, legally speaking, to prevent a strike against Iran. But, if Congress were to take the preemptive step of saying, “You cannot do this,” I think it would do two things. First, it would change the legal calculus, because the executive branch, for decades— this is not a new phenomenon—has resorted to creative lawyering to come up with excuses for using the military abroad. A clear statement from Congress should at least make those executive branch lawyers a lot less willing to push the envelope. It could also change the calculus for the military lawyers who would need to review any actual strike order.
And, politically, I think it would send a powerful message. We have seen, especially recently, that the administration is sensitive to losing support, particularly from its allies in Congress, and a clear congressional statement that there is not the buy-in for military action in this case would also be a limiting factor.
Why has the reaction from Congress to this military buildup been so muted?
DJ: I think there are probably both long-term structural reasons and sort of short-term political reasons, hand in hand with the executive branch's decades-long effort to push the envelope of what it can do has been Congress's acquiescence in the face of those expansions. In some ways, this is part of a constitutionally very dangerous but long-running trend.
Back in 2025, there was an effort after the strikes to pass a war powers resolution. But the most charitable explanation for why Congress didn't act then was that there was a suggestion that the strikes were over and done. It was a one-off, and there was no need for Congress to prevent anything else. The fact that we're back here suggests that was not the correct assessment, and certainly underscores the need for Congress to act urgently now.

More than 1,500 prisoners set for release under Venezuela's new amnesty law
At least 1,557 people - including opposition members, activists, human rights defenders and journalists who were held in Venezuela for political reasons, are expected to be released from prison after submitting their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week, authorities said Saturday.
At least 1,557 people held in Venezuela for political reasons have submitted their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week and are expected to be released from prison, authorities said Saturday.
Thursday’s measure is expected to benefit opposition members, activists, human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.
Its approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who for decades have denied holding any political prisoners. It follows last month’s stunning US military raid in the country’s capital, Caracas, to capture then-President Nicolás Maduro.
“As of today, 1,152 new applications have been received, for a total of 1,557 that are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of releases of persons deprived of liberty who are benefiting from the Amnesty Law are already taking place,” National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez said on Saturday.

Earlier, the president of the special commission overseeing the amnesty law, Jorge Arreaza, said Friday night on state television that 379 amnesty requests had been received and that the applicants’ releases would take place between Friday and Saturday. Further releases could be granted within 15 days, he said.
Gonzalo Himiob, vice president of Venezuela-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal, told The Associated Press on Saturday that so far some have been released in the state of Barinas, in the southwest of the country, but the process of verifying releases under the amnesty was still ongoing.
The new law excludes those convicted of homicide, drug trafficking, serious human rights violations and military rebellion.
Human rights organizations are calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.
Read moreVenezuela approves amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners
“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence,” he said.
Rodríguez said that thousands of requests are being processed from “individuals who were under alternative measures to the system of deprivation of liberty,” and that they are likewise covered by the recently approved Amnesty Law.
Delcy Rodríguez, acting president of Venezuela since January 5, said during the signing of the law that it showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”
The bill’s purpose is to grant people “a general and full amnesty for crimes or offenses committed” during specific periods since 1999 that were marked by politically driven conflicts in Venezuela, including “acts of politically motivated violence” in the context of the 2024 presidential election. The aftermath of that election led to protests and the arrest of more than 2,000 people, including minors.

In the days after Maduro’s January 3 capture, Rodríguez’s government announced it would release a significant number of prisoners. However, relatives and human rights watchdogs have criticized the slow pace of releases and the restrictive conditions under which many have been placed after leaving prison.
Venezuela-based nonprofit Justice, Encounter and Forgiveness has tallied 459 releases of detainees held for political reasons between January 8 and February 20.

Sudanese army repels RSF attack on border town in western Sudan
Clashes erupt in El Tina near Chad border as army-aligned forces deny RSF claim of control
KHARTOUM, Sudan
The Sudanese army and allied joint forces repelled an attack Saturday by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the border town of El Tina in North Darfur state.
The Coordination of Resistance Committees in El Fasher said in a statement that RSF fighters infiltrated El Tina, which lies along the Sudan-Chad border, but were confronted by army troops and joint forces of armed movements allied with the military and retreated after clashes.
The group said the attacking forces withdrew at the onset of fighting in the strategically located town.
Darfur regional governor Minni Arko Minawi described the RSF assault on El Tina as “targeting unarmed civilians and criminal behavior.”
In a post on the US social media company Facebook, he shared videos purportedly showing joint forces seizing RSF vehicles and weapons in El Tina.
Fighters from army-aligned armed movements also circulated videos on social media from inside the town, displaying damaged combat vehicles, weapons, and individuals they identified as RSF detainees.
Earlier Saturday, the RSF said in a statement on its Telegram channel that it had taken control of El Tina.
Of Sudan’s 18 states, the RSF controls the five Darfur states in the west, except for parts of North Darfur that remain under army control. The military retains control over most of the remaining states, including the capital, Khartoum.
Darfur accounts for roughly one-fifth of Sudan’s total area of more than 1.8 million square kilometers, though the majority of the country’s estimated 50 million people live in areas controlled by the army.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands and displaced about 13 million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and famine conditions, according to UN reports.

Nasa astronaut Zena Cardman has shared striking footage of the International Space Station (ISS) "cartwheeling" around Earth.
The ISS performed the rare manoeuvre to allow for a reboost by the Spacex CRS-33. The space station orbits close enough to Earth that there is a small amount of atmospheric drag, and requires periodic reboosts as a result.
The 60x speed timelapse shows the vessel perform an “orbital cartwheel”, as the American astronaut named it, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
Zena Cardman said, "This was one of my favourites since it captures a little of everything - sunset, lightning storms, air glow, moon glint, stars, and sunrise."

Ghislaine Maxwell fighting the release of 90,000 more Epstein files
- Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are challenging the release of 90,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, arguing a new law forcing their disclosure is unconstitutional.
- The legal challenge, filed in Manhattan federal court, aims to block the release of files from a decade-old civil defamation lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell.
- Maxwell's attorneys contend that the 'Epstein Files Transparency Act' violates the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, asserting that Congress cannot override the judiciary's power to protect its files.
- They claim the documents, which include over 30 deposition transcripts, contain private financial and sexual information pertaining to Maxwell and others.
- The move comes amidst ongoing releases of Epstein-related documents, which have revealed new details about his abuse and led to complaints from victims whose personal information was disclosed.

The Committee to Protect Journalists published a report alleging the systematic abuse of Palestinian media workers in Israeli detention centers between 2023 and 2026. Through interviews with dozens of former detainees, the organization documented harrowing accounts of torture, starvation, and sexual violence aimed at silencing the press. The findings highlight that the majority of these journalists were held under administrative detention without formal charges or access to legal counsel. Evidence such as medical records and photographs supports claims of extreme weight loss and untreated injuries resulting from physical beatings. The advocacy group is now calling for international accountability and independent investigations into these alleged violations of humanitarian law. Despite these testimonies, the Israeli military maintains that it adheres to international standards and does not intentionally target members of the media.

Syria appoints presidential envoy to implement deal with SDF
Move aims to strengthen state presence and advance integration in northeastern regions
Istanbul
ISTANBUL
The Syrian presidency on Saturday appointed a presidential envoy to oversee the implementation of the Jan. 29 agreement with the terrorist organization YPG/SDF, according to state media.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing the presidency’s media directorate, said Brig. Gen. Ziad Al-Ayesh has been assigned to follow up on the accord and facilitate integration under the authority of the Syrian state.
The presidency said the appointment is intended to enhance the presence of state institutions, remove administrative obstacles, and activate public services in areas covered by the agreement.
Al-Ayesh hails from the village of Arjah Al-Jawalah in the countryside of Hasakah province in northeastern Syria, according to Syrian media outlets. He holds a degree in Sharia from Al-Ouzai University in Lebanon and a master’s degree in business administration from Idlib University in northwestern Syria.
Prior to the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024, Al-Ayesh headed civil affairs at the Interior Ministry of the Salvation Government in Idlib.
On Jan. 30, the Syrian government announced that it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the SDF aimed at ending division in the country and launching a new phase of integration. It said the deal covering the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous agreement signed on Jan. 18.
The latest agreement followed a military operation by the Syrian Army in which it regained large areas in eastern and northeastern Syria after repeated SDF violations of a March 2025 accord.

Global leaders and businesses react to more U.S. tariff swings

- Global leaders from Mexico City to Paris to Seoul convened emergency meetings to navigate the latest twist in an unpredictable tariff landscape.
- Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” — “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
SEOUL — Governments and companies around the world scrambled Saturday to determine the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down most of President Trump’s sweeping tariffs and his response with a new round of import taxes.
The latest twist in the U.S. tariff roller-coaster ride, launched when Trump returned to office 13 months ago and upended dozens of trading relationships with the world’s biggest economy, roiled trade officials from Mexico to South Korea to South America and beyond.
South Korea’s Trade Ministry called for an emergency meeting Saturday to understand the new landscape. Some specific exports to the U.S., like automobiles and steel, aren’t affected by the U.S. high court decision. Those that are affected will probably now be covered by a new tariff imposed by an executive order Trump signed Friday. Trump announced Saturday morning that he would raise that 10% tariff to 15%.
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the checks and balances in the United States, praising the “rule of law” during a visit to a Paris agricultural fair: “It’s a good thing to have powers and counter-powers in democracies. We should welcome that.”
But he cautioned against any triumphalism.
Officials were going over the language of bilateral or multilateral deals struck with the U.S. in recent months, even as they braced for new swings and Trump’s swift announcement of new tariffs.
“I note that President Trump, a few hours ago, said he had reworked some measures to introduce new tariffs, more limited ones, but applying to everyone,” Macron said. “So we’ll look closely at the exact consequences, what can be done, and we will adapt.”
Mexico braces, adapts
Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” Friday in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. “We have to see where this is going,” Ebrard told reporters. “We have to see what measures [Washington] is going to take to figure out how it is going to affect our country. “
Amid widespread concern about tariffs in Mexico — the United States’ major commercial partner, with almost $1 trillion in annual two-way trade — Ebrard cautioned: “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked about the tariffs, said, “We’ll review the resolution carefully and then gladly give our opinion.”
Ebrard said he plans to travel to the United States next week to clarify matters.
Last year, Ebrard noted, Mexico managed to stave off Trump’s threats to impose a 25% across-the-board levy on all Mexican imports.
However, Mexico has been pushing back against Trump administration tariffs on imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum, among other products.
Among other impacts, the Supreme Court voided so-called fentanyl tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada. The Trump administration said it imposed those levies to force the three nations to crack down on trafficking of the deadly synthetic opioid.
About 85% of Mexican exports to the United States are exempt from tariffs because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The accord extended a mostly free-trade regimen among the three nations, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The three-way pact is scheduled for joint review starting July 1. That date marks six years since the agreement was signed during the first Trump presidential term.
In Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, along the Texas border, Sergio Bermúdez, head of an industrial parks company, discussed Trump’s plan for a new tariff. Trump, he said, “says a lot of things, and many of them aren’t true. All of the businesses I know are analyzing, trying to figure out how it’s going to affect them.”
The impact could be felt especially in Juarez: Much of its economy depends on factories producing goods to export to consumers in the U.S., the result of decades of free trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
The policy swoons in the United States over the last year have made many global business leaders cautious, as they struggle to forecast and see investment take a hit.
CEO Alan Russell of Tecma, which helps American businesses set up operations in Mexico, has seen his job grow increasingly complicated over the last year — his company’s workload has surged as much as fourfold as it grapples with new import requirements. He worries the last U.S. moves will only make things more difficult.
“We wake up every day with new challenges. That word ‘uncertainty’ has been the greatest enemy,” said Russell, who is American. “The difficult part has been not being clear what the rules are today or what they’re going to be tomorrow.”
A ‘good decision’
Swissmem, a top technology industry association in Switzerland, hailed the Supreme Court ruling as “good decision,” writing on X that its exports to the U.S. fell 18% in the fourth quarter alone -- a period when Switzerland was facing much higher U.S. tariffs than most neighboring countries in Europe.
“The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,” Swissmem President Martin Hirzel said on X, while acknowledging the dust is far from settled. “However, today’s ruling doesn’t win anything yet.”

Arab and Muslim states fume after Huckabee says Israel has biblical right to much of Mideast
Saudis, Jordan, PA, Arab League slam US envoy for saying it ‘would be fine’ if Israel took over lands promised in Bible during Carlson interview; he then clarified ‘hyperbolic’ statement
Arab and Muslim nations on Saturday sharply condemned comments by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who said in a recent interview that “it would be fine” if Israel took over a large swath of the Middle East.
Huckabee made the comments during his contentious interview with right-wing American commentator Tucker Carlson which aired Friday, after Carlson said that according to the Bible, the descendants of Abraham would receive land that today would include large parts of the Middle East, and asked Huckabee if Israel had a right to that land.
Huckabee responded: “It would be fine if they took it all.” However, he said that Israel was not looking to expand its territory and has a right to security in the land it legitimately holds.
His comments sparked immediate backlash from Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the League of Arab States, which in separate statements called them extremist, provocative, and not in line with the US position.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry described Huckabee’s comments as “extremist rhetoric” and “unacceptable,” and called for the State Department to clarify its position on them.
Egypt’s foreign ministry called his comments a “blatant violation” of international law, adding that “Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or other Arab lands.”
The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee’s words “contradict US President Donald Trump’s rejection of [Israel] annexing the West Bank.”
Kuwait decried what it called a “flagrant violation of the principles of international law,” while Oman said the comments “threatened the prospects for peace” and stability in the region.
In its statement, the Arab League condemned Huckabee’s “extreme” comment, in which he “asserted Israel’s right to control the Middle East, citing religious texts from the Old Testament.”
The comments “violated all the basic principles and established norms of diplomacy, as well as defying logic and reason,” the group of 22 Arab nations said, adding that the US envoy’s words “contradict US policies and positions across the board, aimed at currying favor with the right-wing public in Israel.”
“Such extremist and baseless statements inflame religious and nationalistic sentiments at a time when Arab states are meeting under the auspices of the Board of Peace to discuss ways to implement the Gaza peace agreement and seize this opportunity to launch a serious peace process,” it added.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is made up of 57 mostly Muslim-majority nations, including the entire Arab League, issued a similar statement, saying it “condemns the dangerous and irresponsible” comments made by Huckabee.
The OIC said the US envoy’s comments were “an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel” that were “based on a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative.”
Such remarks “fuel extremist ideological rhetoric, which would fuel extremism and encourage” Israel to “continue its illegal measures based on displacement, settlement, and attempts to impose annexation” on Palestinian territory, the group said.
There was no immediate response from Israel or the United States.
Huckabee, a devout Christian and outspoken Zionist, commented being pressed by Carlson on his assertion that a part of the Jewish people’s right to the land stemmed from God’s promise to Abraham, while noting that that promised land spanned a far larger territory than that of today’s Israel, encompassing much of present-day’s Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He asked whether it did not follow then that Israel had a right to take land from neighboring Arab countries.
After initially avoiding the matter, Huckabee eventually said, “It would be fine if they took it all,” while swiftly adding that this was not on the table as “They’re not asking to take it over.”
Carlson then asked the US ambassador to confirm he was fine with Israel taking over “all of Syria, all of Lebanon.” Huckabee responded, “That’s really not exactly what I’m trying to say,” adding that “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
In a subsequent back-and-forth, Carlson demanded to know whether Huckabee believes Israel “has a moral right to take over what are now other people’s countries,” as the envoy insisted he had not said that. Eventually, Huckabee said: “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, then, okay, that’s a whole other discussion.”

Zelensky commends special services for neutralizing Russian mercenaries
As reported by Ukrinform, the head of state said this in his evening address.
“I want to commend the efforts of the Security Service of Ukraine, the National Police, and the Office of the Prosecutor General – they neutralized Russian mercenaries preparing assassination attempts against our citizens. These were rather high-profile names, and preventing such crimes is a substantial result,” Zelensky said.
He noted that he had heard a report from Oleksandr Poklad, Deputy Head of the SSU.
“And this is yet another front in the ongoing protection of Ukraine’s security, the safety of Ukrainians, and the constant defense of the lives of our people – the way our Ukrainian special services, our law enforcement, and our intelligence neutralize Russian criminal activity against Ukrainians. They were preparing attacks against Ukrainian military personnel, Ukrainian intelligence officers, and Ukrainian media workers. It is important that all our Ukrainian special services and law enforcement continue to protect Ukrainian citizens in exactly this coordinated way,” the President emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Security Service of Ukraine and the National Police exposed a criminal group that had been preparing contract killings on behalf of Russian special services, including plans to assassinate Andrii Yusov, a representative of the Defense Intelligence Directorate. Other targets included Ukrainian journalists and civic activists, the head of a strategic enterprise, and fighters of the DIU International Legion.

JPMorgan concedes it closed Trump’s accounts after Jan. 6 attack
JPMorgan Chase now confirms it closed Trump’s accounts after mob of his supporters stormed halls of Congress
- Bookmark
Banking giant JPMorgan Chase acknowledged for the first time that it closed the accounts of President Donald Trump and several of his businesses in the political and legal aftermath of the January 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
The disclosure marks the latest development in a legal saga over Trump’s alleged “debanking” after the president sued America’s largest bank for $5 billion alleging his accounts were closed for political reasons.
The acknowledgment came in a court filing submitted this week in Trump's lawsuit against the bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon.
“In February 2021, JPMorgan informed Plaintiffs that certain accounts maintained with JPMorgan’s CB and PB would be closed,” JPMorgan's former chief administrative officer Dan Wilkening wrote in the court filing. The “PB” and “CB” stands for JPMorgan's private bank and commercial bank.
In a letter to Trump submitted to the court Friday, dated February 19, 2021, the bank said it was recommending that he “find a more suitable institution with which to conduct business.”
“With that in mind, this letter is to respectfully inform you that we will need to end our current relationship,” the letter to Trump said.
Until now, JPMorgan has never admitted it closed the president's accounts, and would only speak hypothetically about when the bank closes accounts and its reasons for doing so.
In a previous statement, the bank said it “does not close accounts for political or religious reasons” but does so when accounts “create legal or regulatory risk for the company.”
Trump initially sued JPMorgan in state court in Florida, where Trump has his primary residence at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach. JPMorgan Chase is seeking to move the case to federal court in New York, which is where the bank accounts were located and where Trump kept much of his business operations until recently.
Trump accuses the bank of trade libel and accuses Dimon himself of violating Florida’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
In the original lawsuit, Trump alleges he tried to raise the issue personally with Dimon after the bank started to close his accounts, and that Dimon assured Trump he would figure out what was happening. The lawsuit alleges Dimon failed to follow up with Trump.
Further, Trump’s lawyers allege that JPMorgan placed the president and his companies on a reputational “blacklist” that both JPMorgan and other banks use to keep clients from opening accounts with them in the future.
JPMorgan previously said it believes the suit has no merit.
“Debanking” occurs when a bank closes the accounts of a customer or refuses to do business with a customer in the form of loans or other services. Once a relatively obscure issue in finance, debanking has become a politically charged issue in recent years, with right-wing figures arguing that banks have discriminated against them and their affiliated interests.
“In a devastating concession that proves President Trump’s entire claim, JPMorgan Chase admitted to unlawfully and intentionally de-banking President Trump, his family, and his businesses, causing overwhelming financial harm,” the president’s lawyers said in a statement.
Trump is “standing up for all those wrongly debanked by JPMorgan Chase and its cohorts, and will see this case to a just and proper conclusion,” they added.
Debanking first became a national issue when right-wing figures accused Barack Obama’s administration of pressuring banks to stop extending services to gun stores and payday lenders under “Operation Choke Point.”
Trump and his allies have alleged that banks cut them off from their accounts under the umbrella term of “reputational risk” after January 6, when a mob of his supports stormed the halls of Congress in a failured effort to derail the results of the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost.
After Trump returned to the White House last year, the president’s banking regulators have moved to stop any banks from using “reputational risk” as a reason for denying service to customers.
This is not the first lawsuit Trump has filed against a big bank alleging that he was debanked.
The Trump Organization sued credit card giant Capital One in March 2025 for similar reasons and allegations. That case is ongoing.

Iran designates naval and air forces of EU states ‘terrorist entities’ in tit for tat move
Tehran took reciprocal measures in response to what it called 'illegal and unjustified' decision by EU member states to designate Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as 'terrorist organization,' says Foreign Ministry
TEHRAN, Iran
Iran has designated the armed forces of European Union member states as “terrorist entities” in a tit-for-tat move.
In a statement on Saturday, Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that the country took reciprocal measures in response to what it called the “illegal and unjustified” decision by EU member states to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a “terrorist organization.”
The statement noted that Iran has decided to designate all naval and air forces of European Union member states as “terrorist organizations.”
It added that the European governments designated the IRGC “in violation of the fundamental principles and rules of the United Nations Charter and international law,” describing it as “one of the official components of the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
"The Islamic Republic of Iran will act based on the principle of ‘reciprocity,’” it stated.
The Council of the European Union said in a statement on Thursday that it had formally decided to add the IRGC to the EU terrorist list, weeks after a political agreement was reached among member states.
“Following its listing, the IRGC will also be subject to restrictive measures under the EU counterterrorism sanctions regime,” the statement read, referring to the “freezing of its funds and other financial assets or economic resources” in EU member states, as well as the “prohibition for EU operators to make funds and economic resources available to the group.”
A total of 13 individuals, 23 groups, and entities are now subject to restrictive measures under the EU terrorist list, it added.
Tensions have dramatically escalated between Iran and some European countries following recent protests inside Iran, with European leaders condemning what they described as a crackdown on protesters.
Earlier this month, the Iranian parliament announced that Iran now considers EU armies to be terrorist organizations, after the country’s top security body approved the measure.
The parliamentary announcement was followed by the summoning of the ambassadors of EU member states to the Foreign Ministry.
At the time, the ministry described the EU move as “unjustified and irresponsible,” emphasizing that it “violates fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.”
Meanwhile, tensions continue to escalate in the region amid an unprecedented US military buildup and IRGC military drills in the Persian Gulf.

Report: IRGC running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel if US strikes Iran
Israel said to see Hezbollah preparing rocket-fire capabilities, recent IDF strikes said aimed at degrading them; anti-Hezbollah outlet quotes ‘political sources’ saying Beirut must declare neutrality
Officers from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have effectively taken charge of Hezbollah in anticipation of a war with the US and Israel, Saudi outlet Al-Arabiya reported Saturday, as Lebanese officials were said to assail the possibility of their country getting dragged into battle.
The IRGC officers, some of whom recently arrived in Lebanon from Iran, are tasked with rebuilding Hezbollah’s military capabilities, which were significantly degraded in the 14-month fighting with Israel that ended with a November 2024 truce, Al-Arabiya said, citing sources close to Hezbollah.
The Iranian officers have also been personally briefing Hezbollah operatives across Lebanon, said the unnamed sources cited by Al-Arabiya. They added that IRGC officers were meeting with members of Hezbollah’s missile unit at a site in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that was bombed by Israel overnight, amid a wave of airstrikes that wounded at least 50 people and killed 12, including a senior Hezbollah officer. The IDF said the strikes targeted Hamas and Hezbollah command centers.
According to the Hezbollah-aligned sources, a wider Israeli military offensive against Lebanon is only a matter of time.
The report came as US President Donald Trump has amassed military forces in the region and repeatedly threatened to use them against Iran, first over the Islamic Republic’s brutal crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month and more recently over its nuclear program.
Israel is readying to fight alongside the US and expects to be targeted by Iran if the US strikes there, according to Hebrew media.
The Kan public broadcaster reported Saturday evening that Israel has identified preparations by Hezbollah — particularly by its rocket forces — to strike if Iran is attacked, with the Lebanese terror group expected to target Israel together with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.
Haaretz reported, quoting unnamed Israeli military sources, that recent Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah were intended to degrade its capabilities amid the possibility of conflict. At least 10 people were reported killed and 50 wounded in Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon on Friday, after the Israel Defense Forces said it had targeted Hezbollah command centers.
Channel 12 news reported Saturday that Trump was leaning toward attacking Iran, but had agreed to a request from his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to give Iran another day or two to submit a proposal in the indirect US-Iran nuclear negotiations that commenced earlier this month.
An unnamed US official was quoted by the network saying that the 10- to 15-day deadline Trump gave Iran on Thursday was “not scientific.”
Trump has demanded Iran give up entirely on its nuclear enrichment program, but is reportedly open to letting the Islamic Republic preserve some “token” enrichment capabilities.
Speaking to pro-Iran demonstrators in Lebanon last month, Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said the terrorist group would not be neutral if the US struck Iran, but stopped short of explicitly threatening Israel.
Meanwhile, the Ynet news site said in an unsourced report this week that Iran was pressuring Hezbollah to fight alongside it in the event of a war with Israel. The report also said the IDF had prepared a plan to “significantly strike” Hezbollah and had conveyed to it “that if it decides to intervene, this time the blow will be very painful.”
On Saturday, anti-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet Nidaa al-Watan cited “prominent political sources” in the country as saying Beirut must declare its neutrality in case of a US-Iran war, and refuse to let Hezbollah drag Lebanon into war with Israel.
“Hezbollah thought it could confuse Israel and the US by saying it would not be neutral if Iran were struck, so Israel responded by saying that as soon as it’s informed by Washington of the zero hour, it will preemptively strike Hezbollah. Israel won’t let Hezbollah have the initiative,” Nidaa al-Watan quoted its sources as saying. “Hezbollah will drag Lebanon into this war.”
Hezbollah, previously a formidable force in Lebanon’s government, has been politically sidelined with the accession in January 2025 of Lebanon’s US- and Saudi-backed President Joseph Aoun, a former army chief who has vowed to uphold a state monopoly on arms — a thinly veiled threat against Hezbollah’s extensive arsenal.

'Chronicles From the Siege’: Filmmaker dedicates Berlinale win to Palestinian liberation struggle

Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib used his acceptance speech at the Berlinale film awards ceremony to make a solidarity statement in support of the Palestinian liberation struggle.
“We will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us, against our right to live with dignity, or those who chose to be silent. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world,” he told the audience in Berlin on Saturday after his film “Chronicles From the Siege", which tells the story of people trying to survive occupation, was named Best First Feature.
He accused the German government of being “a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
Al-Khatib, who brought a Palestinian flag onto the stage, said that one day there would be “a great film festival in Gaza” dedicated to all oppressed people in the world.
Earlier, Lebanese filmmaker Marie-Rose Osta, who won the Golden Bear for best short film, had also criticised Israel's genocide on stage.
“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine, and in Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs. No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law," she said in her acceptance speech.
“The ceasefire continues to be violated by Israel both in Gaza and Lebanon,” Osta added.
She stressed that the lives of children in Gaza and Lebanon are "not negotiable.”
On Wednesday, dozens of actors and directors, including Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton, accused the Berlin International Film Festival of "anti-Palestinian racism" and urged organisers to state their opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza clearly.
In an open letter published in Variety, 81 film workers criticised what they called the Berlinale’s “involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The signatories also took issue with comments by this year’s jury president, Wim Wenders, who said at a recent press briefing in Berlin, when asked about Gaza, “We should stay out of politics.”
Last week, award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy withdrew from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory.

OIC slams US ambassador's remarks on Israeli Mideast expansion as threat to regional stability
Organization of Islamic Cooperation warns US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee's comments fuel extremism and undermine international law
ISTANBUL
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab League on Saturday condemned remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, warning that his comments about Israeli expansion in the Middle East threaten regional security and stability as well as inflame religious and national sentiments.
Huckabee argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s biblical right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
The OIC described Huckabee’s remarks in a statement as “dangerous and irresponsible,” calling them an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel, the occupying power, and the seizure of additional Palestinian and Arab lands.
The comments were based on “a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative and claims" that violate state sovereignty, diplomatic norms, principles of international law, UN resolutions, and the UN Charter, the group added.
The organization warned that such extremist rhetoric would fuel further extremism and embolden Israeli policies centered on displacement, settlement expansion, and attempts to impose annexation on occupied Palestinian territory.
It said these measures "threaten security and stability in the entire region.”
The bloc reaffirmed its unwavering support for what it described as the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them the right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent, sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Separately, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, secretary-general of the Arab League, condemned Huckabee’s claims, calling them contrary to the most basic principles and norms of diplomacy.
In a statement on US social media company X, Aboul Gheit said the remarks contradict official US policies and positions and appear aimed at appealing to right-wing audiences in Israel.
He warned that such extremist statements, which lack any legal or political basis, “inflame religious and national sentiments” at a time when countries are convening under a Board of Peace framework to explore ways to implement a Gaza peace agreement and seize the opportunity to launch a serious political process.
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission," including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

WASHINGTON - NASA chief Jared Isaacman on Feb 21 ruled out a March launch for Artemis 2, the first crewed flyby mission to the Moon in more than 50 years, citing technical issues.
Workers detected a problem with helium flow to the massive SLS rocket that will “take the March launch window out of consideration,” Mr Issacman said in a post on X.
“I understand people are disappointed by this development. That disappointment is felt most by the team at NASA, who have been working tirelessly to prepare for this great endeavor,” Mr Isaacman said.
“During the 1960s, when NASA achieved what most thought was impossible, and what has never been repeated since, there were many setbacks.”
The towering SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft will be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to investigate the technical issues and make any necessary repairs, Mr Isaacman said.
A complete briefing will follow in the coming days, he added.
The highly anticipated Artemis 2 mission, lasting about 10 days, will see three Americans and one Canadian fly around Earth’s satellite.
It would be a huge step towards Americans once again setting foot on the lunar surface, a goal announced by President Donald Trump in his first term.
On Feb 20, NASA had set March 6 as the earliest possible launch date
The US space agency hopes to put humans back on the Moon as China forges ahead with a rival effort that is targeting 2030 at the latest for its first crewed mission.
China’s uncrewed Chang’e 7 mission is expected to be launched in 2026
NASA surprised many late in 2025 when it said Artemis 2 could happen as soon as February – an acceleration explained by the Trump administration’s wish to beat China to the punch.
But the programme has been plagued by delays.
The uncrewed Artemis 1 mission took place in November 2022 after multiple postponements and two failed launch attempts.
Then technical problems in early February – which included a liquid hydrogen leak – cut short a so-called wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis 2 launch. That was finally completed earlier this week.
The wet dress rehearsal was conducted under real conditions – with full rocket tanks and technical checks – at Cape Canaveral in Florida, with engineers practicing the maneuvers needed to carry out an actual launch.
NASA is hoping that the Moon could be used to help prepare future missions to Mars. AFP

Berlinale winner dedicates speech to Palestinian liberation struggle
Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib accuses German government of being ‘a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel’
BERLIN
Syrian-Palestinian filmmaker Abdallah Al-Khatib on Saturday used his acceptance speech at the Berlinale film awards ceremony to make a political statement in support of the Palestinian liberation struggle.
“We will remember everyone who stood with us, and we will remember everyone who stood against us. Against our right to live with dignity, or those who choose to be silent. Free Palestine from now until the end of the world,” he told the audience in Berlin after his film “Chronicles From the Siege,” which tells the story of people trying to survive occupation, was named Best First Feature.

He accused the German government of being “a partner in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
Al-Khatib, who brought a Palestinian flag onto the stage, said that one day there would be “a great film festival in Gaza” dedicated to all oppressed people in the world.
Earlier, Lebanese filmmaker Marie-Rose Osta, who won the Golden Bear for best short film, had also criticized Israel's conduct of the war on stage.
“In reality, children in Gaza, in all of Palestine, and in my Lebanon do not have superpowers to protect them from Israeli bombs (...) No child should need superpowers to survive a genocide empowered by veto powers and the collapse of international law," she said in her acceptance speech.
“The ceasefire continues to be violated by Israel both in Gaza and Lebanon,” Osta added.
She stressed that the lives of children in Gaza and Lebanon are "not negotiable.”
On Wednesday, dozens of actors and directors, including Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton, accused the Berlin International Film Festival of "anti-Palestinian racism" and urged organizers to clearly state their opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
In an open letter published in Variety, 81 film workers criticized what they called the Berlinale’s “involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.”
The signatories also took issue with comments by this year’s jury president, Wim Wenders, who said at a recent press briefing in Berlin, when asked about Gaza, “We should stay out of politics.”

Marshal of Polish Sejm names key topics of Ukraine Recovery Conference in Gdańsk
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by Włodzimierz Czarzasty, Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland.
“The recovery of Ukraine is an investment in the security of all of Europe. We want to focus on three areas: investments, transport and logistics links, as well as trade and exports. The conference in Gdańsk will become a platform for real projects, not just declarations,” Czarzasty said, stressing that it will have “political and symbolic significance.”
As reported by Ukrinform, Kyiv and Warsaw have begun practical preparations for the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC-2026) and agreed to deepen trade and economic cooperation.
At the end of January, representatives of the authorities of Poland’s Subcarpathian, Lublin, and Podlaskie voivodeships met to coordinate efforts with the Ukrainian side to support Ukraine amid the energy crisis.

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped

Chatter dials up on Apple’s folding iPhone as 2026 launch tipped
When Apple unveils its iPhone 18 models this September, it may also introduce an entirely new form factor for its smartphones, with rumours intensifying that a folding iPhone is finally ready for release.
Samsung has been releasing folding phones for more than six years, and although they got off to a rocky start, they’ve become a steadily growing product category. Could a folding iPhone tip the format into mainstream acceptance? Or will the majority stick with the standard models, leaving folding phones a niche concern?
Rumours and speculation about Apple’s folding iPhone have been ongoing for years, so at this point, it seems likely the company has tested multiple designs.
In 2024, a report in The Information cited people directly involved in the project as saying Apple would release a flip-style phone, sized like a regular iPhone but with a horizontal crease in the middle to fold into a small square, similar to Samsung’s Z Flip. But more recent reports point to something larger, with multiple analysts describing a passport-shaped device that opens up to become a small tablet.
This shape would differ from most book-style foldable devices on the market, including Samsung’s Z Fold and Google’s Pixel Pro Fold. While those models more or less resemble normal phones while folded, and become a square-ish tablet, Apple’s supposed device would be square-ish in both modes; a 2:3 ratio when folded and around a 4:3 ratio when opened. The advantage would be that both of those screen shapes are in use by iPads, so apps wouldn’t need to be adapted.
Longtime Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo described this format in a note last year, also saying that Apple had developed a hinge which eliminated the perceptible gap in the middle of the inner screen. Kuo said the company was prioritising thinness and sleek design even if it made for a notably expensive device, and that it would include a fingerprint sensor instead of Face ID. These details were backed up in a newsletter from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said the phone would cost more than $US2000 ($2840).
As for the size of the device, multiple rumours indicate an outer screen size of 5.5 inches which, given the 2:3 ratio, would make for a device approximately 8cm x 12cm when closed. Quite a different shape to the latest Z Fold, which is 7cm x 16cm. It would also be the shortest iPhone since 2010’s iPhone 4.
Last year, 3D design files appeared on the internet that had supposedly (but unverifiably) leaked from Apple’s production line. They matched the above measurements, and designers used them to create digital models and 3D-printed dummies, giving glimpses of a phone that resembles a small notepad. When opened, the tablet would have a screen size of 7.8 inches, making for a device smaller than the iPad Mini by just a few centimetres on either edge.
Analyst Jeff Pu has suggested there will be multiple size options for the device, but only the one size has appeared in most rumours.
Demand for iPhones has remained consistent despite each generation of device lasting longer than the last, and despite investor hand-wringing about Apple’s perceived lack of AI features. But the overwhelming bulk of that demand is for the standard iPhone, or the Pro model, with comparatively few users going for the outlier Mini, Plus or Air models.
In fact, some reports have indicated that last year’s Air underdelivered spectacularly, with Apple cutting production to just 10 per cent of its original estimates. The ultra-thin phone is very expensive, lacks features the standard iPhone has including multiple rear cameras, and is an unproven form factor despite Apple’s claims of extraordinary durability.
Bloomberg’s Gurman claims that the design of the folding iPhone will be similar to two Air models joined together, albeit in a different shape. Apple will need to hope there is enough pent-up demand for a non-Android folding phone to counter durability concerns, especially if it claims to have also developed a brand new hinge system that eliminates the foldable screen gap.
Of course, Apple has form with introducing its own takes on devices that other manufacturers have had for years. The iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods were all late to their respective categories, and while they may not have taken off immediately, they did eventually become the overall leading models.
If Apple introduces a $3000 folding iPhone this year, it may not be met with enough immediate demand for it to overtake the standard iPhone or even Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold. But it could win users over time, especially if Apple markets to its base of creatives who would otherwise have a phone and an iPad Mini separately.
Gurman has reported that Apple is so confident in the folding iPhone that it is already planning a follow-up that would give users the choice between the notepad style and a smaller Z Flip style device.

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian

Burnt-out Toyota may be linked to missing 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian
Nearly 10 days after the kidnapping of 85-year-old Chris Baghsarian, NSW Police are appealing to the public for information relating to suspicious car fires last Tuesday in Westmead that could be linked to his kidnappers.
It comes as police scoured bushland in Glenorie in Sydney’s north-west on Sunday afternoon in what they said was “part of an ongoing investigation” linked to the grandfather’s disappearance.
Baghsarian has been held hostage since February 13, when up to three men abducted him from his North Ryde home at about 5am in what police believe is a suspected case of mistaken identity.
Two vehicles were partially destroyed in suspicious fires on Good Street, Westmead, at about 11.30pm on Tuesday, February 17.
NSW Police said detectives were able to establish that the targeted vehicle was a 2022 Toyota Corolla bearing Victorian registration “1UZ2BU”, reported stolen from a Victorian address on January 13.
Investigators from Strike Force Chobat believe the decimated Toyota in the images are related to a crime scene established at a Dural property in north-west Sydney where, police believe, Baghsarian’s kidnappers may have held him hostage for some time over the past 10 days.
After reports that two vehicles were alight, Cumberland Police Area Command attended the location, not far from Parramatta Aquatic Centre, along with Fire and Rescue NSW, who extinguished the blaze.
This masthead reported last week that the Dural property was a “stronghold” used by kidnappers to hold an elderly man hostage. It matched images circulated throughout Sydney’s underworld showing the 85-year-old being tortured, as police admit hope of finding him alive is fading.
Police have issued several direct pleas to the kidnappers to return Baghsarian, who requires daily medical treatment and medication.
Baghsarian’s family said in a statement this week that he was deeply loved and a devoted father, brother, uncle and grandfather.
“The kindest person we know – someone who would never hurt a fly,” the family said in a statement released by NSW Police last Tuesday.
“Chris’ kidnapping feels surreal, and we are struggling to make sense of the fact that he has been taken, and that our family has been caught up in something that has nothing to do with us.
“We are living through a nightmare we never thought possible.”
Anyone who may have seen or heard anything, or has CCTV, dashcam and or mobile footage relating to the kidnapping, or witnessed any sort of suspicious activity in the Westmead area since last Friday is urged to contact detectives.
Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers: 1800 333 000 or crimestoppers.com.au. Information is managed on a confidential basis. The public is reminded not to report information via NSW Police social media pages.

Now Donald Trump and the royal family know ‘the rule of law’ is no empty phrase

The shock of seeing a member of the royal family, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in the back of a car after he was released from police custody will reverberate in British history for generations to come. The photograph by Phil Noble of Reuters that featured on our front page this week will send a powerful and welcome message, one that has been reinforced in a statement by the King: “The law must take its course.”
There will be those who question that course. Some will argue that the allegations of the sexual abuse of women and girls facilitated by Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier and convicted sex offender, are more serious than the vague charge of misconduct in public office in relation to the former Prince Andrew’s trade envoy role that prompted the police to act.
Others will say, and indeed have said, that the use of the power of arrest was not necessary in this case, as Mr Mountbatten-Windsor would not have refused to attend an interview voluntarily.
These, however, are second-order issues that can be addressed in due course. What is of paramount importance is the principle that no one in Britain is above the law. The last vestige of royal prerogative was swept away when Queen Elizabeth II started to pay income tax in 1993, and Britain accepted that the rule of law applies to everyone in the country, irrespective of their social or economic status.
The same principle applies, thank goodness, in the United States – the nation to which we are most prone to compare ourselves. This week’s ruling by the Supreme Court, overturning President Donald Trump’s tariffs, was a vindication of that principle – strengthened rather than diminished by Mr Trump’s graceless tirade against the six justices in the majority, calling them “a disgrace to the nation”, “fools” and “lapdogs” for the “radical left Democrats”.
Against the ravings of a bad loser, it is worth quoting the noble sentiments expressed by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who was nominated to the court by Mr Trump. His concurrence appeared almost personally addressed to the president: “Yes, legislating can be hard and take time. And, yes, it can be tempting to bypass Congress when some pressing problem arises. But the deliberative nature of the legislative process was the whole point of its design. Through that process, the nation can tap the combined wisdom of the people’s elected representatives, not just that of one faction or one man.”
Justice Gorsuch concluded: “If history is any guide, the tables will turn and the day will come when those disappointed by today’s result will appreciate the legislative process for the bulwark of liberty it is.”
Mr Trump has, naturally, cocked a snook at the court by announcing a new 15 per cent tariff on all imports – a measure that will probably be struck down and more quickly than this week’s ruling.
The US also faces a more serious “rule of law” problem than Mr Trump’s unconstitutional attempts to levy tariffs without the consent of Congress. Agents of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) appear to have been deployed by the president in something resembling a reign of terror, and the arc of justice is taking its time to bend towards ending it.
Yet this week’s Supreme Court ruling offers hope that the rule of law will eventually prevail on both fronts. It should also remind us in Britain how priceless our reputation for fair dealing truly is.
On Friday we reported that YTL, the Malaysian-based multinational company, will invest £4bn in Britain, including in the Aviva Arena, a new events venue in Bristol. “We love the UK and are pleased to be its largest Malaysian investor,” Francis Yeoh, its executive chair, said. He has previously praised Britain as a place “where the rule of law is the order of the day”.
The rule of law is no abstract principle. It is the guarantee of the rights of every member of society and the foundation of our prosperity.

'Awesome' Cherry-Evans lauded on debut by star Roosters teammate

Daly Cherry-Evans and Sam Walker show promising signs as Eels down Roosters in NRL trial
In short:
Daly Cherry-Evans has shown promising signs of a strong combination with Sam Walker in his first match in Roosters colours.
Walker, who scored a try and set up two others, said his veteran teammate had "been awesome".
New Eels pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also combined well as the Eels sealed a comeback 28-22 win.
Daly Cherry-Evans has played his first game in Sydney Roosters colours, but it was halves partner Sam Walker who stole the show before Parramatta came back to win their pre-season clash 28-22.
With all eyes on Cherry-Evans after 15 years in Manly colours, halves partner Walker scored a try and set up two others in the Roosters' final pre-season hit out.
New Parramatta pairing Mitch Moses and Jonah Pezet also had glimpses of promise in their first outing together, playing through the opening 40 minutes together.
The Roosters led 22-12 when Cherry-Evans and James Tedesco left the field, before the Eels came back to win the game and wrap up the NRL's pre-season challenge title.
Cherry-Evans is set to be one of the most scrutinised men in the league this year, with his arrival at the Roosters making them one of the early-season favourites.
Having played all of his 352 NRL games at halfback for Manly, much will also be made of how he and Walker gel together in the Roosters' attack this year.
The 37-year-old wore number six on Saturday night with Walker at number seven, but the veteran was still the most vocal man in the Roosters' attack and spent most of the night directing traffic.
Playing on his normal right side, Cherry-Evans was also the Roosters' primary in-play kicker while the halves split their touches.
Clearly though, Cherry-Evans's presence helped free up Walker.
The halfback scored one try when he dummied to his senior halves partner and stepped through the Eels' defence to go over.
Walker then put Angus Crichton over for a try moments later with a perfect short ball on the left edge.
The halfback had also helped lay on the Roosters' first points when Isaiah Iongi spilled one of his bombs and Lindsay Collins dived on the loose ball.
And while a lightning storm after that try forced the game to be delayed for 45 minutes, it quickly became obvious Walker and Cherry-Evans had the potential to gel well.
"It was a little bit touch and go for the first 20," Walker said on Fox League at half-time.
"But I feel now we've got our flow going and are very comfortable with each other. He's been awesome."
Roosters coach Trent Robinson also confirmed Benaiah Ioelu would start the season at hooker, replacing injured recruit Reece Robson.
With Robson set to miss a month with a broken thumb, Ioelu had a role in one try on Saturday night when he ran out of dummy-half, kicked a bomb and Tommy Talau scored.
For Parramatta, Moses and Pezet linked up a few times, including in the lead-up to a disallowed try for winger Bailey Simonsson.
The slickest piece of play came with a beautiful Dylan Walker short ball for Moses, who burst through a gap and sent Matt Doorey over.
Moses handed over goalkicking duties to Pezet after that try and ran laps of the field at half-time, before not returning after the break.
But Parramatta officials have insisted that was already part of a plan for the star halfback and there was no injury concern.

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional

Ghislaine Maxwell fights release of more Epstein documents, calling disclosure law unconstitutional
NEW YORK (AP) — Lawyers for imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting the requested release of 90,000 pages related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell, saying a law used to force the public release of millions of documents is unconstitutional.
The lawyers filed papers late Friday in Manhattan federal court to try to block the release of documents from a since-settled civil defamation lawsuit brought a decade ago by the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre against Maxwell. The Justice Department recently asked a judge to lift secrecy requirements on the files.
Maxwell’s attorneys said the Justice Department obtained the documents — otherwise subject to secrecy orders — improperly during its criminal probe of Maxwell. They said the documents include transcripts of over 30 depositions and private information regarding financial and sexual matters related to Maxwell and others.
Some records from the year-long exchange of evidence in the lawsuit battle were already released publicly in response to a federal appeals court order.
Maxwell’s lawyers say a law Congress passed in December to force the release of millions of Epstein-related documents violates the Constitution’s separation of powers doctrine.
“Congress cannot, by statute, strip this Court of the power or relieve it of the responsibility to protect its files from misuse. To do so violates the separation of powers,” wrote the lawyers, Laura Menninger and Jeffrey Pagliuca about the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
“Under the Constitution’s separation of powers, neither Congress nor the Executive Branch may intrude on the judicial power. That power includes the power to definitively and finally resolve cases and disputes,” the lawyers added.
The release of Epstein-related documents from criminal probes that began weeks ago has resulted in new revelations about Epstein’s decades-long sexual abuse of women and teenage girls. Some victims have complained that their names and personal information were revealed in documents while the names of their abusers were blacked out.
Members of Congress have complained that only about half of existing documents, many with redactions, have been made public even as Justice Department officials have said everything has been released, except for some files that can’t be made public until a judge gives the go-ahead.
Giuffre said Epstein had trafficked her to other men, including the former Prince Andrew, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. She sued Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17.
He denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022. Days ago, he was arrested and held in custody for nearly 11 hours on suspicion of misconduct in having shared confidential trade information with Epstein.
In a memoir published after she killed herself last year, Giuffre wrote that prosecutors told her they didn’t include her in the sex trafficking prosecution of Maxwell because they didn’t want her allegations to distract the jury.
Maxwell, 64, was convicted in December 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein took his own life in a federal lockup in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.
Two weeks ago, she declined to answer questions from House Oversight Committee lawmakers in a deposition conducted in a a video call to her federal prison camp, though she indicated through a statement from her lawyer that she was “prepared to speak fully and honestly” if granted clemency.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling

Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
Trump says he’ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15%, up from 10% he had announced a day earlier after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down many of the far-reaching taxes on imports that he had imposed over the last year.
Trump’s announcement on social media was the latest sign that despite the court’s check on his powers, the Republican president still intends to ratchet up tariffs in an unpredictable way. Tariffs have been his favorite tool for rewriting the rules of global commerce and applying international pressure.
The court’s decision on Friday struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law. Trump now said he will use a different, albeit more limited, legal authority.
He’s already signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10% tax on imports from around the world, starting on Tuesday, the same day as his State of the Union speech. However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended legislatively.
The White House did not immediately respond to a message inquiring when the president would sign an updated order to peg the tariffs at 15%.
He wrote on social media that he was making the announcement “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.”
By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs because the power to tax lies with Congress.
In addition to the temporary tariffs that Trump wants to set at 15%, the president said Friday that he was also pursuing tariffs through other sections of federal law which require an investigation by the Commerce Department.
He wrote on Saturday that “during the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again.”
After the Supreme Court decision, Trump made an unusually personal attack on the justices who ruled against him in a 6-3 vote, including two of those he appointed during his first term, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump, at a news conference on Friday, said that the situation is “an embarrassment to their families.”
He was still seething Friday night, posting on social media complaining about Gorsuch, Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, who ruled with the majority and wrote the majority opinion. On Saturday morning, Trump issued another post declaring that his “new hero” was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent. He also praised Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were in the minority, and said of the three dissenting justices: “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic policies, which he has said address a host of ills, from reviving trade imbalances and reviving U.S. manufacturing to forcing other nations to action, whether it be stepping up efforts to combat drug trafficking or ceasing hostilities with each other.
He also regularly claimed despite evidence to the contrary that foreign governments would pay the tariffs—not American consumers and businesses.
Federal data shows the Treasury had collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December, and Trump has made many promises about what that money might go toward, such as paying down the national debt and sending dividend checks to taxpayers. The Supreme Court decision did not address what happens to the funds that have already been collected from tariffs.
Democrats spoke out quickly on Trump’s new tariff threat. Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.
“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that “he does not care about you.”

Blizzard warnings issued from Delaware to Massachusetts as storm threatens East Coast
NEW YORK (AP) — A rapidly intensifying storm triggered blizzard warnings Saturday for New York City, New Jersey and Boston as communities along the East Coast prepared for the Sunday arrival of heavy snow and damaging winds.
The National Weather Service increased its assessment of the potential severity of a storm that was projected to be much milder only days earlier.
The weather service said 1 to 2 feet (about 30 to 61 centimeters) of snow was possible in many areas as it issued blizzard warnings for New York City and Long Island, Boston and coastal communities in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Flooding was also possible in parts of New York and New Jersey, it said.
“While we do get plenty of these nor’easters that produce heavy snow and strong impacts, it’s been several years since we saw one of this magnitude across this large of a region in this very populated part of the country,” said Cody Snell, a meteorologist at the service’s Weather Prediction Center.
Snell said the storm would arrive Sunday morning in areas around Washington before stretching toward Philadelphia and New York City and reaching Boston in the evening.
The weather service said the storm could begin as rainfall in some places before worsening, with the heaviest snowfall expected at night and as much as 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow per hour at times in some areas, before tapering off by Monday afternoon.
The weather service warned that the storm, with steady winds of 25 to 35 mph (40 to 56 kph) would “make travel dangerous, if not impossible. Scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds.”
Officials scrambled to prepare for a storm that forecasters days ago believed would have a much more limited impact.
New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city would expand on efforts it used to deal with a major snowfall weeks ago. But officials held off on deciding whether to open schools Monday for the time being.
“We saw on Friday there was expectation that the likelihood was that we were going to face maybe 3 to 4 inches of snow. Quickly that then changed,” Mamdani said. “So we want to make sure that we make a decision based on up-to-date and accurate information.”
New York brought in additional snow clearing equipment from outside the city and planned to increase use of geocoding to keep track of bus stops and crosswalks that need clearing, he said.
With the storm zeroing in, John Berlingieri scrapped plans for a family trip to Puerto Rico to prepare his company, Berrington Snow Management, for what could well be a mammoth task: Clearing snow from millions of square feet of asphalt surrounding shopping malls and industrial parks across Long Island.
Employees spent the last few days recharging batteries on the company’s 40 front-end loaders and replacing windshield wipers on snow removal vehicles, before resting up Saturday.
“I’m anticipating at least one week of work around the clock,” Berlingieri said. “We’re going to work 24 to 36 hours straight, sleep for a few hours and then go back.”
The storm approached just as the icy remains of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks earlier were finally melting away.
Officials in Atlantic City, New Jersey, urged residents and casino visitors to stay off the streets, especially in low-lying neighborhoods prone to flooding.
“I could go on and on probably with a good two dozen streets where we know we will get water and there will be snow on top of that,” said Scott Evans, the city’s fire chief and emergency management coordinator. “So you won’t be able to see it until it’s too late, so therefore please stay at home.”
Many churches canceled Sunday services and other activities. To compensate, St. Veronica Parish in Howell, New Jersey, added an extra Mass on Saturday evening.
“Please stay safe, avoid unnecessary travel, and keep one another in prayer during the storm,” the Rev. Peter James Alindogan posted online.

MFA transfers over 200 DJI Matrice reconnaissance drones to Ukraine’s Defense Forces
This was reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as cited by Ukrinform.
According to Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, the units receiving the drones include Azov, Liut, the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as the STRIX UAV unit.
He explained that diplomacy during wartime is not limited to “negotiating tables, international summits, or complex sanctions decisions,” but also includes “concrete support for our soldiers on the front line.”
“These drones were purchased with charitable donations collected in the Czech Republic. This is the result of joint work by diplomats, partners, and caring individuals who understand that supporting Ukraine is not about words, but about action,” the minister emphasized.
Sybiha stressed that the reconnaissance drones will help save the lives of Ukrainian service members, improve decision-making accuracy, and provide an advantage on the battlefield.
“When these drones were being loaded, everyone got involved – from attachés to the deputy minister. No ranks or offices. Just a team that knows exactly why it is doing this. This is not a one-time initiative for us. It is systematic work. The diplomatic front operates as continuously as all the others, and everyone is doing what is necessary for victory in their own place,” the foreign minister said.
As reported by Ukrinform, in September last yea,r the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Modern Ukraine Foundation transferred 20 fiber-optic FPV drones to the 21st Separate Mechanized Brigade, as well as three 35 kW generators for regional clinical hospitals in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and Kharkiv.

US wins its record 11th gold medal at the Winter Olympics
The U.S. team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Olympics when the trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis took the title in mixed aerials
- Bookmark
The U.S. Olympic team won its record-breaking 11th gold medal of the Winter Games on Saturday, with at least one more good possibility when its men's hockey team wraps up the action on closing day with the title game against Canada.
The trio of Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis gave the U.S. the record by capturing the American team's second straight title in mixed aerials.
The 11th gold breaks the country's mark set at the last Olympics on U.S. soil — in Salt Lake City in 2002, which has long stood out as a turning point for a winter sports program that had struggled over previous decades.
This could end up being another turning point, not so much for the sheer number of medals but the variety of places from which they came: Twelve of the 17 sports disciplines represented in the Winter Games produced medals for the U.S.
“Our focus and our strategy has always been about breadth,” said Sarah Hirshland, the CEO of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee. “We want to win in everything. We want to make every sport better. Some could argue there are countries that go a mile deep in certain sports and really dominate. Our goal has been to improve Winter sport across the board.”
The aerials medal, then a bronze in speedskating from Mia Manganello later in the day, lifted the U.S. to 31 overall for the Olympics with one day left.
That's second to Norway, which had a record 18 gold medals and 40 overall through Saturday evening. Seventy-two percent of the golds came in the endurance sports of cross country, biathlon and Nordic combined. The biggest gold-medal hauls for the U.S. came in four disciplines — two each (18%) in Alpine skiing, freestyle skiing, figure skating and speedskating.
There are 38 more medal events on the program this year than there were in 2002. A lot of the new events have come at the snowpark — halfpipe, slopestyle and big air — which used to be America's domain but has now been taken over by Japan, which, for instance, won nine medals in snowboarding, compared to two for the U.S.
“We stated we wanted to be a podium nation,” Fin Kirwan, the USOPC's chief of Olympic sport, said of the U.S. goal of being top-three on the medals table. “We said it will likely take 30 medals and we got after it. The athletes delivered on their potential and, by turn, we hit the record on gold-medal performance, which shows that our very best were able to execute.”
Here are some looks and links to the rest of the 11 U.S. gold medal winners:
Alex Ferreira, freeskiing
Halfpipe skier rounds out his Olympic collection — gold, silver, bronze. Back home, he’ll keep going with streamer “Hotdog Hans” where he dressed up like an 80-something ski sensation.
Breezy Johnson, Alpine skiing
Her long journey included a knee injury four years ago on the same mountain where she won the gold.
Elizabeth Lemley, moguls
Nicknamed “Lizard,” she joins a long line of great U.S. moguls skiers, including 2010 champion Hannah Kearney and her teammate, Jaelin Kauf, who now has three silver medals.
Alysa Liu, figure skating
The 20-year-old stepped away after the 2022 Beijing Games, rediscovered her love for figure skating and happily claimed the title.
Elena Myers Taylor, bobsled
At her sixth Olympics, she finally broke through, becoming the oldest Winter Olympian to win gold at age 41.
Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine skiing
The most winning skier of all time cashes in at the Olympics with slalom gold after a tear-stained shutout four years ago.
Jordan Stolz, speedskating (2)
Joined Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980 as only the second man to capture the 500 and 1,000.
US figure skating team
Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin are among the members of a team that brings home second straight gold; the last one took two years to capture after a Russian doping saga.

Houthi mobilize troops in Yemen with unclear target, as possible strike on Iran looms in - report
Unknown

05:17:17 KST

The Houthis may be mobilizing forces for an offensive, a report at Al-Ain media in the UAE said on February 21. The Houthis' objectives are unclear. However, the report of mobilization is important because it comes amid heightened tensions with Iran.
It also comes after the UAE and Saudi Arabia almost clashed over differing policies in Yemen. The Saudis have supported the government of Yemen, while the UAE has supported a group in southern Yemen called the Southern Transitional Council.
What does the Al-Ain report say? According to the report, the Houthis have mobilized on various fronts within Yemen. It may be an attempt to “ignite a new round of war.” What sources told Al-Ain is that “the Houthi militias have sent military reinforcements to Marib Governorate, where oil fields are located, and to the Hodeidah fronts on the Red Sea, in addition to reinforcements to the northern border fronts.”
Move against Saudi-backed forces?
This could indicate a Houthi move against the Riyadh-backed government forces in Yemen. It could also be part of a Houthi plan to take advantage of Saudi-UAE tensions or to pounce as US-Iran tensions grow. It’s also possible that Al-Ain is being fed misinformation designed to create tensions. Because there are so many possibilities, it is worth being skeptical about the reports.
The report goes on to say that the “sources explained that large Houthi military groups moved on Saturday from the city of Amran, located 50 kilometers north of Sana'a, led by the Houthi leader Mohammed Zaid Yahya Al-Makhdhi, nicknamed Abu Ali, to the northern border fronts of the country.”
In addition, “the sources indicated that the military force that the militias deployed to the Saada and Al-Jawf fronts on the northern borders of the country comes as part of the group’s military mobilization to all fronts,” while adding that the Houthis have also sent commanders to the Hodeidah governorate. This is an area near a port that shares the same name. This port was targeted numerous times by Israel last year when the Houthis were targeting Israel with ballistic missiles.
The report goes on to say that "the Houthis force had received intensive training at a Houthis ' training camp in Sana’a, before being deployed through Naqil Manakhah to Hodeidah. On February 18, the Houthi militias sent unprecedented reinforcements from Sana'a to the fronts of Marib Governorate, under the leadership of commander Khaled Mohammed Al-Nadhari, nicknamed Abu Ayman.”
Lastly, the report argues that Houthi fighters arrived at the Marib front. This area has been an active frontline in the past. Over the last three years, the clashes between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed Yemen government have been reduced. This is part of a wider shift in the region in which Riyadh also settled some of its problems with Iran. Riyadh has also grown closer to Turkey and Qatar over the past year, as it has distanced itself from the UAE’s policies in the region. This mostly led to a reduction in tensions with the Houthis.
Al-Ain concludes that “the unprecedented Houthi mobilization and ground attacks on the battlefronts threaten to collapse the fragile UN-brokered truce in place since 2022 and return the situation to square one, according to observers.” It is unclear if this is part of a wider attempt by Iranian-backed groups to create tensions in the region. Reports on February 21 said that Hezbollah is also considering escalation with Israel. Iranian-backed militias in Iraq have also threatened the US and Israel in the past.

Syria might close Roj Camp, last site holding ISIS-linked families, soon, officials say
Unknown

20:17:09 UTC
05:17:09 KST

The Roj camp in Syria may be closed in the coming days or weeks, according to an official in eastern Syria. Rudaw Kurdish media reported on February 21 that “Roj camp, which houses families of Islamic State (ISIS) fighters, will be fully closed in the near future, a northeast Syria (Rojava) official said on Saturday.”
The report comes after other reports have claimed that some 15,000 people left another large camp called Al-Hol. These are some of the 50,000 families of ISIS fighters who surrendered back in 2019. This large group of people mostly consisted of children. The women and children came from some 60 countries. There were also around 7,000 men.
When the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces began to clash with the Syrian government in January, there were concerns about what might happen with the estimated 25,000 people in Syria who were in around 30 prisons and camps run by the SDF. These facilities held ISIS male prisoners, as well as around 18,000 women and children. The women and children were mostly at two large camps called Al-Hol and Roj.
Over the last seven years, since ISIS was largely defeated in Syria in 2019, the ISIS families have slowly been repatriated by some countries. Many countries, particularly in Europe, did not take back their citizens. However, Iraq eventually took back thousands of its citizens. The ISIS families were left in limbo for a few reasons.
One reason was that although the anti-ISIS coalition had around 90 countries as members, none of them wanted to deal directly with the SDF because they didn’t view it as a government. On the other hand, they didn’t want the ISIS-linked women and children handed over to the Assad regime or freed. Thus, the people languished in prisons and camps.
The Syrian government joined the anti-ISIS coalition in November 2025. This meant it could not decide what to do with the ISIS detention facilities. US Central Command decided in January 2026, amid clashes between the SDF and Damascus, to move 7,000 ISIS male detainees to Iraq. This is because Iraq has experience investigating ISIS crimes. Many ISIS crimes, such as the mass murder of Yazidis, occurred in Iraq. The chaos in Syria also led some to be concerned that the ISIS men would escape.
Syria plans to let women, children go home
The women and children, judged to be less of a threat, were left behind at Al-Hol and Roj camps. Al-Hol fell into the hands of the Syrian government in January. Many of the women and children left the camp at this time, leaving a few thousand behind. Syrian officials have secured the camp and visited it. They appear to believe the people should have a right to leave. These women and children were never charged with crimes, and they have been denied any due process for seven years. Syria appears to prefer to let them go home, either to Syria, where some are from, or to their roughly 60 home countries.
Meanwhile, at Roj camp, the SDF is still in charge. It is in the spotlight because some 34 Australians there want to go back to Australia. Australia doesn’t seem keen on helping them. This is the usual policy of countries, leaving their citizens in Syria rather than dealing with them.
Rudaw reports that “Sheikhmous Ahmed, who supervises refugee and IDP camps in Rojava, told Rudaw that a joint decision has been made with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to empty the camp.” The report quotes him as saying, “For this purpose, coordination has taken place with the High Commissioner for Refugees regarding their transfer.”
Syrian families are already leaving and going home, apparently. It is not clear why the SDF continued to keep them in Roj camp or Al-Hol once the new Syrian government had emerged. “Roj camp remains under the control of the Autonomous Administration and is guarded by Asayish [SDF-linked] security forces. Ahmed stressed that the area around the camp is stable and free of ISIS cells, and that aid organizations continue to provide services on a daily basis,” Rudaw notes. There are some 730 foreign families from 42 countries in the camp. In addition, there are a handful of Iraqis and Syrians in the camp. “Approximately 2,225 people live in the camp, according to the Kurdish official.”
Now the SDF is moving to deal with the Roj camp and has the people go home and be repatriated. Once again, it is unclear why this process didn’t happen a year ago. “Previously, contacts were conducted through the [US-led] global coalition and the SDF’s foreign relations office,” Ahmed said. “Now, any country wishing to repatriate its citizens must directly contact the Autonomous Administration, and we are ready to provide all necessary facilitation.”

Trump's options on Iran: Trump weighs 'token' Iran enrichment in narrow nuclear compromise - report
Unknown

The Trump administration is considering an Iranian proposal that would allow so‑called “token” uranium enrichment, according to senior US officials cited by Axios.
The potential concession would test the limits of longstanding US demands that Iran’s nuclear program not leave any possible path to a bomb.
Under the scenario outlined, Washington would evaluate a written Iranian offer in which Tehran retains minimal enrichment capacity but with strict safeguards to prevent any route to weaponization.
The report suggests this represents a narrow diplomatic opening between the red lines of the two sides, even as pressure mounts on the possibility of wider conflict.
At the same time, US President Donald Trump has been presented with military options that involve directly targeting the supreme leader, and US naval and air forces continue to arrive in the Middle East.
Potential US-Iran bargain on enrichment
Publicly, US officials have maintained that zero enrichment remains the standard for any deal with Tehran.
But US sources told Axios that the administration is open to a limited compromise, as long as it can be verified that any uranium enrichment is purely civilian and cannot be used as a stepping‑stone toward nuclear weapons development.
Tehran’s own position on enrichment appears to have evolved in recent talks. While Tehran has maintained a rigid stance on the issue, vowing that no external pressure will impact negotiations, Iranian officials have signaled willingness to reduce the level and perhaps the purity of uranium already enriched to 60 percent, a level far above what is needed for civil nuclear power but below weapons‑grade. This approach would hinge on monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
On Monday, Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met the UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, ahead of US-Iran nuclear talks to tackle their dispute over Tehran's nuclear program.
Days later, in an interview with MS NOW’s Joe Scarborough, Araghchi claimed that Iran was willing to implement “confidence-building measures” to “ensure that Iran's program cannot even be diverted to non-peaceful purposes” such as the possible construction of nuclear weapons.
Iran is said to be preparing a written counterproposal to send to Washington after approval in Tehran, Axios reported. The timing and details are unclear, but diplomats have indicated that the offer could outline limits on the number of centrifuges and the level of enrichment, framed to demonstrate compliance with peaceful use only.
Military options still on the table
Despite these diplomatic maneuvers, the US military buildup in the region continues to fuel uncertainty in Tehran and allied capitals. US officials have presented Trump with a series of operational options intended to either compel Iran to accept US terms or, if diplomacy fails, degrade Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure.
On Thursday, US Senator Lindsey Graham said that planning was underway for a possible joint US-Israel attack on Iran. Trump later added that the US was considering an initial, limited strike on Iran to force Tehran to agree to his demands regarding a deal.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home,” one senior official said, warning that if Tehran “plays games, there won’t be a lot of patience.”

Italy's RAI apologizes after latest gaffe targets Israeli bobsleigh team

Italy's state broadcaster RAI was forced to apologize to the Jewish community on Saturday after an off‑air remark advising its producers to "avoid" the Israeli crew was broadcast before coverage of the Four-Man bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics.
The head of RAI's sports division had already resigned earlier in the week after his error-ridden commentary at the Milano Cortina 2026 opening ceremony two weeks ago triggered a revolt among its journalists.
On Saturday, viewers heard "Let's avoid crew number 21, which is the Israeli one," and then "no, because ..." before the sound was cut off.
"I firmly condemn the statements made today by a RAI journalist regarding the Israeli bobsleigh delegation at the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics," said Jonathan Peled, Israel's ambassador, on social media.
"There should be no room in sport for incitement to hatred, discrimination based on national, cultural, or religious beliefs, and any offensive rhetoric.
Italian broadcasters apologize after hateful comments about Israeli Olympic athletes
"We are confident that the RAI management will take all necessary measures to ensure that similar incidents are not repeated," he said.
RAI CEO Giampaolo Rossi said the incident represented a "serious" breach of the principles of impartiality, respect, and inclusion that should guide the public broadcaster.
He added that RAI had opened an internal inquiry to swiftly determine any responsibility and any potential disciplinary procedures.
In a separate statement, RAI's board of directors condemned the remark as "unacceptable." The board apologized to the Jewish community, the athletes involved, and all viewers who felt offended.
RAI is the country's largest media organization and operates national television, radio, and digital news services.
The union representing RAI journalists, Usigrai, had said Paolo Petrecca's opening ceremony commentary had dealt "a serious blow" to the company's credibility.
His missteps included misidentifying venues and public figures, and making comments about national teams that were widely criticized.

Ellyse Perry's 350th international match has been soured as India claimed a 17-run win in a series-deciding T20 in Adelaide.
Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with 82 off just 55 deliveries and featured in a 120-run stand with World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues.
India's 6-176 was the highest ever women's T20 international score at the Adelaide Oval.
Australia's women cricketers have slipped to a 17-run loss to India in their series-deciding Twenty20 fixture.
India claimed a 2-1 series triumph after posting 5-176 on Saturday night at Adelaide Oval, the highest women's T20 international score at the venue.
Australia mustered 9-159 in reply, losing traction after their initial three wickets fell in a 13-ball span.
The match was Ellyse Perry's 350th international match.
"It was a bit of a bugger, we couldn't get the result for her tonight," Australia captain Sophie Molineux said of Perry.
"She's a special person, a special cricketer, she has done so much for the game and continues to."
Australian openers Georgia Voll and Beth Mooney cracked 18 runs from the first over, delivered by Renuka Singh Thakur.
But Voll (10) and Mooney (six) were dismissed in a space of six balls.

Australian great Perry scored only one. She advanced to spinner Shreyanka Patil and attempted a big drive but missed and was bowled.
Perry's dismissal left the hosts reeling at 3-32 in the fourth over and Phoebe Litchfield and Ash Gardner steadied with a 31-run stand.
But Litchfield (26 from 17 balls) was caught in the deep from consecutive switch-hits. She smacked a four from the first one to leave the hosts 4-63 in the ninth over.
The Australians were 4-78 at the midpoint and Gardner gave her side a sniff, making 57 from 45 balls before she too was caught in the deep.

Gardner's departure started another Australian slump of 4-15.
"We actually thought we kept them to a good score. It was a pretty good wicket," Molineux said.
"We just lost some pretty important wickets at the wrong point in time."
Earlier, Indian opener Smriti Mandhana top-scored with a superb 82 from 55 balls and featured in a 120-run partnership with No.3 Jemimah Rodrigues (59 from 46).
Australia struck early when quick Kim Garth (1-25) dismissed Shafali Verma (seven) in the third over.
Mandhana and Rodrigues then produced their fine stand, powering the tourists to 1-86 at the midpoint of their innings.
The 29-year-old Mandhana registered her half-century from only 38 balls by smacking Darcie Brown over the midwicket fence for six.
The partnership was finally broken in the 17th over when Mandhana lofted Annabel Sutherland (2-34) into the legside only for Gardner to make swift ground from deep midwicket and take a catch on the run.
The nations meet again on Tuesday in Brisbane for the first of three 50-over fixtures, ahead of a Test match starting March 6 at the WACA Ground in Perth.
Those matches will be the last for ex-Australian skipper Alyssa Healy before she retires.
"[Healy] is going to bring an injection of some real excitement," Molineux said.
"It's going to be her last four games for Australia and we're going to do everything possible to send her off on the right note."
The trophy at the end of the multi-format series is decided on a points system, with two points for a T20 and 50-over victory and four points on offer for a Test triumph.

Brazil and India agree to boost cooperation on rare earths
Brazil and India have signed a new deal to cooperate on rare earths and other critical minerals
- Bookmark
Brazil and India sealed a deal Saturday on critical minerals and rare earths, enhancing cooperation on crucial resources between two major countries of the global south as they seek to diversify their trading relationships.
The non-binding memorandum of understanding on rare earths establishes a framework for cooperation between the two countries, focusing on reciprocal investment, exploration, mining and artificial intelligence applications, among other issues.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of rare earth minerals, used in a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, solar panels and jet engines.
“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energy and critical minerals is at the core of a pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told journalists.
The two countries also agreed legal frameworks on a range of topics including entrepreneurship, health, scientific research and education.
Lula arrived in India for a state visit on Wednesday that will last through to Sunday, seeking to deepen ties with India which, like Brazil, is a founding member of the BRICS+ bloc of developing nations. He participated in a summit on artificial intelligence.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Brazil in July last year, while the trip to India was Lula’s second state visit.
Lula was accompanied by 11 ministers, including those of foreign affairs, finance, health and agriculture, as well as a large delegation of business leaders. The Brazilian leader on Saturday said it may be the biggest delegation of his trips abroad so far, which he called a sign of his commitment to India.
The deal on rare earths is part of a broader strategy from both India and Brazil to become more strategically autonomous from China and the U.S. through diversification, said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university.
Brazil has been pursuing that strategy for years, said Stuenkel, which is why Lula was able to stand up to President Donald Trump last year when the U.S. leader imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports to the country over the trial of his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro.
“The reading is that, given how turbulent and unpredictable things have become, the more partners, the better,” Stuenkel said.
The U.S. later removed most tariffs on Brazil and the sanctions imposed on the judge who was overseeing the case.
Roberto Goulart Menezes, an international relations professor at the University of Brasilia, said that last year’s confrontation with the U.S. is when Brazil germinated the idea of putting rare earths and critical minerals on the bargaining table.
“Brazil began to reposition its understanding of the importance of these elements beyond their commercial dimension, recognizing their geopolitical relevance,” said Goulart.
Lula is expected to visit his counterpart in Washington D.C. in the coming months. “For Brazil, this agreement represents a kind of pilot before negotiating with a country with which Brazil has an asymmetrical relationship,” Goulart said.

Ukraine's commander-in-chief says war not at stalemate, situation could have been far worse
Oleksandr Syrskyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, believes that the Russo-Ukrainian war has not reached a stalemate and that Moscow's objectives for 2025 were far more ambitious than its actual achievements.
Source: Syrskyi in an interview with Le Monde
Details: The article notes that the multiplicity of military operations leads Syrskyi, unlike his predecessor Valerii Zaluzhnyi, to assert that "the war has not reached a stalemate". Not only do territories continue to change hands, but "the war is being fought in all domains – on land, in the air and at sea", and "it is now impossible to speak exclusively about a ground war".
Speaking about 2025, Syrskyi said the military situation could have been significantly worse, as Russia's objectives were much more ambitious.
Quote: "Russia prepared its forces to conduct a large-scale offensive operation in 2025. It wanted to seize the entire Donbas, territories in Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Kherson oblasts, and to create a buffer zone in Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts, but it failed to do so."
Details: Syrskyi also stressed that although Russian forces had been reputed to have an inexhaustible supply of manpower, while the Ukrainian army faced difficulties recruiting new soldiers, 2025 became the first year of the war when "the losses of the Russian army exceeded its recruitment levels".
He stated that "despite managing to mobilise and conscript 406,000 personnel in 2025, their total losses, including those killed and wounded, amounted to around 418,000 soldiers".
Background:
- In November 2023, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, who at the time was commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said in an interview with The Economist that the situation on the front had reached a stalemate, where neither side could advance due to equal technological capabilities. He compared it to the First World War.
- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy disagreed with him at the time.
- On 8 February 2024, Zelenskyy signed a decree relieving Zaluzhnyi of his duties as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces.

Two Israeli businessmen in their mid-30s were detained for 18 days in Zambia on suspicion of involvement in terrorism after an explosion in their hotel room in the capital, Lusaka, authorities and their attorney said.
The incident dates back to September, when the two men, who work for an agricultural company in Malawi bordering Zambia, were staying at the InterContinental hotel in Lusaka.
According to their account, they placed a bottle of fertilizer in the room’s refrigerator, intending to take it back with them to Malawi. For reasons that remain unclear, the substance exploded inside the refrigerator, completely burning the room and causing damage to adjacent rooms.
The two men left Zambia shortly afterward and returned to Malawi.
Four months later, they re-entered Zambia and were arrested at a border crossing after authorities determined they were wanted in connection with the explosion. They were taken for questioning by Zambia’s counterterrorism unit on suspicion of links to terrorism, based on the blast in a room registered in their names.
The two men said they had received the bottle of fertilizer from another employee of their agricultural company and were instructed to keep it refrigerated. They told investigators they were unaware the substance could ignite or explode.
The counterterrorism unit rejected their explanation and also suspected they had intended to smuggle a drone, according to their attorney.
The men were held in difficult conditions in two separate detention facilities to prevent them from coordinating their accounts. Each was held in a small cell with 14 other detainees.
Israel’s ambassador to Zambia, Ofra Farhi, and the embassy’s security officer visited the detainees, and at their request conditions of detention were improved. The ambassador and security officer also met with investigators and officials from Zambia’s Interior Ministry.
After more than two weeks of questioning, the counterterrorism unit ruled out terrorism suspicions. On Friday, the two businessmen were deported from Zambia and barred from returning.
Attorney Mordechai Tzivin, who specializes in representing Israelis facing legal trouble abroad, said: “I am pleased with the release and thank the law enforcement authorities in Zambia for reaching the conclusion that these are legitimate businessmen — that no wrongdoing was found in their actions and that the suspicion of involvement in terrorism was proven unfounded — as well as representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the embassy in Zambia for their intensive efforts and meetings with senior Zambian officials and the Zambian ambassador to Israel.”

Julien Macdonald proves the ‘king of glamour’ is back at London Fashion Week
Ella Eyre and Montana Brown were among those sitting front row.

Julien Macdonald made a high-shine return to London Fashion Week, staging his autumn/winter 2026 comeback on the interior rooftop of The Shard with a collection that reaffirmed his reputation as fashion’s self-styled “king of glamour”.
Perched high above the capital, guests nursed martinis as the Welsh designer sent out a procession of sequinned, sculpted silhouettes against the glittering night skyline.
Singer Ella Eyre was among those seated front row, watching as Macdonald delivered a show steeped in his signature high-octane energy.
It marked Macdonald’s first London Fashion Week runway since restructuring his business in 2023, and the message was unmistakable: unapologetic, maximalist glamour is back.
Macdonald, 54, who launched his label in 1997 and has previously held high-profile roles at Chanel and Givenchy, has long been synonymous with red-carpet showstoppers. His return leaned fully into that legacy, delivering a collection of high-impact eveningwear designed for drama rather than understatement.
The show opened with fluid, body-skimming gowns in metallic tones, including a liquid gold halter-neck dress that plunged dramatically at the front and twisted into a draped, thigh-split skirt.
The silhouette elongated the body, the fabric catching the light with every step, evoking the kind of paparazzi-ready moment Macdonald’s celebrity clientele – from Beyonce to Jennifer Lopez – have made their own.
Sequins were deployed liberally across the collection. A sharply cut, long-sleeved column dress in burnished bronze shimmered under the spotlights, its structured shoulders lending to Macdonald’s siganture statuesque quality.
Elsewhere, micro silhouettes dominated: a black, crystal-embellished two-piece with sheer shorts and cut-out detailing left little to the imagination, styled with pared-back heels to keep the focus on the body.
Feathers, which have been trending on the runway, gave a theatrical flourish to the collection.
A mint-green, crystal-studded bodysuit was paired with a matching feathered robe that trailed behind the model, its texture softening the overt sensuality of the barely-there base layer.
In another look, a sheer black gown with feathered hem detailing glided down the runway, balancing transparency with movement.
There was little concession to winter in the traditional sense. Despite the autumn/winter billing, Macdonald’s world remains resolutely summer – or at least permanently party-bound.
Backless gowns, plunging necklines and high-cut bodysuits dominated, with sheer panels and strategic cut-outs forming a recurring motif. One pale green, sequin-drenched gown featured a deep V neckline gathered at the waist and a front slit that revealed just enough leg, merging red-carpet polish with beach-club ease.
The setting at The Shard amplified the excitement for this comeback show. With London’s skyline twinkling beyond the glass, the show felt less like a seasonal presentation and more like a celebration – a statement of resilience and return.
If much of this season’s schedule has leaned into restraint then Macdonald offered a fun alternative of high-octane, unapologetic, old-school glamour.
The designer has signalled a shift towards a more accessible luxury ready-to-wear model, focusing on versatile embellished pieces. While the collection remained firmly in the eveningwear sphere, several looks – streamlined sequinned dresses and sharply cut cocktail numbers – suggested a commercial sensibility beneath the glitz.
Macdonald was named British Fashion Designer of the Year in 2001 and appointed chief designer at Givenchy the same year, succeeding Alexander McQueen. More than two decades later, his formula of sequins, skin and skimpy silhouettes remains largely unchanged.
Julien Macdonald’s return delivered something of a jolt of joy above the London skyline.

Over 3,000 people march in France in honour of far-right activist

On Saturday, Macron called for calm ahead of a demonstration in tribute to Quentin Deranque, whose murder has sent shockwaves through the country.
Around 3,200 people took part in a demonstration led by far-right groups on Saturday, following the death of a nationalist activist who was beaten in the French city of Lyon.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of the tribute to Quentin Deranque, 23, who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week. The demonstrations took place under heavy police scrutiny, with no major incidents reported.
The mayor of the 7th arrondissement neighbourhood, Fanny Dubot, told Euronews that security had been stepped up at potentially threatened locations, such as an LGBT bar and a mosque.
“This is a moment of remembrance and respect for this young compatriot who was killed, for his family and loved ones. That must come first. And then it is a moment of firmness and responsibility,” Macron said.
Seven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers next week to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled.
“In the republic, no violence is legitimate,” he said. “There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising.”
Lyon emerges as a battleground
The main tribute to Deranque took place in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Their fighting often takes the form of organized street battles in the city, sometimes involving groups of several dozen people.
Lyon’s far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque’s parents also called for calm and did not take part in the tribute, which was not banned by French authorities.
Deranque’s death triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming the far-left France Unbowed party and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a France Unbowed lawmaker who set up the anti-fascist group The Young Guard.
There was a minute’s silence before the start of the march. Some demonstrators held white tulips and displayed stickers bearing the slogan: “Quentin, killed by Mélenchon’s militia.”
Many men dressed in black, some with their faces partially covered, joined the march. Police are investigating individuals suspected of making Nazi salutes, chanting racist slurs and homophobic insults during the demonstration, incidents that were captured in videos circulating online, local authorities said.
Christian Petiteau, 70, who traveled from the neighboring Isère region, said Deranque was “cowardly murdered” and that he came to honor his memory.
Far-left in focus
France Unbowed’s opponents accuse it of fomenting violence and tensions with its combative far-left politics. Mélenchon has condemned the violence and insisted that his party bore no blame for the tragedy.
Mélenchon stood for the presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022, but failed to advance to the decisive runoff round. He is preparing for another expected run next year, when Macron’s second and last term ends.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonize France Unbowed. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party.
Criticism also came from prominent figures on the left, including former French President François Hollande. He said the mainstream left, including his Socialist Party, must not team up again with Mélenchon’s party for the upcoming elections, as they did in the past.

Hezbollah brases for war as Iranian Revolutionary Guard take command

Hezbollah is stepping up military and security meetings as it braces for a possible war against Israel, according to a report by the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya network.
Sources close to the Lebanese terrorist organization told the network that Hezbollah is now effectively being run by officers from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps rather than by Lebanese officials.
The officers, the sources said, are not only overseeing efforts to rebuild the terrorist organization after months of fighting but are also directly supervising operational plans and holding meetings with Hezbollah commanders in more than one area to issue instructions and guidance.
According to the report, some of the Iranian officers have been in Lebanon for some time, while others arrived recently amid the possibility of a US attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The sources also disclosed that Iranian officers recently met with Hezbollah's missile unit in the Beqaa Valley, which was targeted in an Israeli strike on Friday. They assessed that a broader Israeli attack against Hezbollah is "inevitable" and that it is "only a matter of time" before a conflict erupts.

Ukraine’s MFA responds to blackmail by Hungary and Slovakia: Ultimatums should be sent to Kremlin, not to Kyiv
This is stated in a statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, according to Ukrinform.
“Such actions, in the context of massive and targeted Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Moscow's attempts to deprive Ukrainians of electricity, heating, and gas during extreme cold weather, are provocative, irresponsible, and threaten the energy security of the entire region,” the Foreign Ministry said.
The statement stresses that by acting in this way, the governments of Hungary and Slovakia are not only playing into the hands of the aggressor but are also harming their own energy companies that operate on a commercial basis.
The Foreign Ministry noted that Ukraine remains in constant contact with representatives of the European Commission regarding damage to energy infrastructure caused by daily Russian strikes.
Ukraine has also conveyed information to the governments of Hungary and Slovakia about the consequences of these attacks for the Druzhba oil pipeline infrastructure. It is emphasized that, under the constant threat of new missile attacks, security and stabilization repair work is ongoing. Ukraine has also proposed alternative solutions for supplying these countries with non-Russian oil.
“Ukraine has always been, is, and will remain a reliable energy partner of the EU and a transit country for energy resources. At the same time, in light of the unfounded and irresponsible threats coming from Budapest and Bratislava in recent days, Ukraine is considering the possibility of activating the Early Warning Mechanism provided for in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union,” the ministry said.
In this context, the Foreign Ministry calls on the governments of Hungary and the Slovak Republic to engage constructively and behave responsibly, stressing:
“Ultimatums should be sent to the Kremlin, and certainly not to Kyiv.”
As previously reported by Ukrinform, on February 20, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote on social media that his country would block the EU’s allocation of funds to Ukraine under a €90 billion loan until the transit of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline was restored.
Meanwhile, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stated on Saturday that if Ukraine did not resume oil transit to Slovakia, he would initiate a halt to electricity supplies to Ukraine on Monday.

Salsa legend Willie Colón dies at age 75, family says

Feb 21 - American salsa legend Willie Colon, the pioneering trombonist, vocalist and composer, died on Saturday at age 75, his family said in a statement.
"While we grieve his absence, we also rejoice in the timeless gift of his music and the cherished memories he created that will live on forever," the family said on Colon's Facebook page.
The cause of death was not disclosed.
Born in the Bronx to Puerto Rican parents, Colón recorded dozens of albums including La Gran Fuga (The Big Break) in 1970 and El Juicio in 1972, according to Fania Records, a label that promoted salsa music.
He signed with Fania at age 15 and two years later, in 1967, released his first album El Malo, which has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to his biography on the LA Philharmonic website.
Colón's music combined elements of jazz, rock and salsa, incorporating the rhythms of traditional music from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Africa, the biography said.
"A significant overarching theme in Colón’s music—which draws from many cultures and several different styles—is an exploration of the competing associations that Puerto Ricans have with their home and with the United States," it said.
"He uses his songs to depict and investigate the problems of living in the U.S. as a Puerto Rican and also to imply the cultural contributions that Puerto Ricans have to offer."
In 2004, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
A longtime social activist, Colón was a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS and the United Nations Immigrant Foundation and was a board member at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, according to the biography. REUTERS

Willie Colón, trombone and salsa legend, dies at 75

Willie Colón, a legendary trombonist and pioneer of salsa music, has died. He was 75.
His death on Saturday was confirmed in a Facebook post by his longtime manager, Pietro Carlos.
News of the singer’s condition circulated on the web in recent days. Yonkers Voice News reported Colón was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Westchester hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., on Tuesday with respiratory problems and he appeared fragile.
Born William Anthony Colón Román on April 28, 1950, to Puerto Rican parents in New York City, Colón first picked up the trumpet in school. It seemed like a natural choice for the former bugle-playing Boy Scout, who attended the youth program at the suggestion of his grandmother.
“So I could learn how to be a good boy,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press.
By age 13, Colón had started a band and played at some weddings and in the bustling nightclubs of New York City. At one point, he forged a cabaret card, a mandated ID for musicians and entertainers between 1940 and 1967 who worked in establishments serving alcohol, which required individuals to be 18 years and older.
The thrilling 1960s Latin music scene in New York consumed Colón, who was deeply inspired by Latin jazz pioneer and bandleader Eddie Palmieri, once part of a main act at the Palladium Ballroom who went on to form La Perfecta, a Cuban conjunto that revolutionized the New York Latin music scene with its inclusion of two trombones, played by Barry Rogers and Jose Rodriguez, instead of the costly four-set trumpets.
But Colón’s instrumental preference changed once he heard the bodied timbre of Mon Rivera’s all-trombone brass lineup marching to a bomba beat. “It would knock my socks off,” said Colón in a 1988 interview with Associated Press, leading the singer to teach himself how to play the instrument.
By age 15, Colón was signed to Fania Records. Two years later at age 17, he went on to release his debut album, “El Malo,” a record that defined the fierce sounds of New York’s salsa scene, which Colón later described as the Latin equivalent of rap.
According to his former label, the name of “El Malo” was bestowed upon Colón by older musicians who sought to mock his trombone range at the time, though the young bandleader would find a way to use the label to his advantage.
On the LP, Colón’s sound moved away from the polished mambo sounds of orchestral bands decades prior, in large part due to Puerto Rican singer Héctor Lavoe, whose vocals can be heard in tracks like the gritty “El Malo” that vows to knock out any wanna-be street phony.
The pair would go on to record a total of 14 albums through 1973, with Lavoe’s talents for improvisation complementing Colón’s raw, aggressive trombone.
“Salsa came from the same kind of situation that rap does,” Colon said in a 1992 interview with The Times. “It was kind of a hybrid of a bunch of different elements. Hector had just come from Puerto Rico and didn’t speak English. I didn’t speak much Spanish, I was a little New York kid. We got together and just started with the same kind of irreverent, rebellious attitude, writing songs about the baddest guy on the block, drugs and sex. Before that, the lyrics and whole attitude of Latin music was, ‘Look at me dance, listen to those drums, I’m cutting sugar cane.’ It was a rural, folkloric emphasis; we changed it to an inner-city kind of culture.”
Colón’s impact went beyond live music. The album cover of “El Malo,” which showed two serious profiles of Colón, depicted the singer as a sly bad boy, and ultimately gave rise to his gangster persona, which would be a throughline in future projects, including his sophomore 1968 album, “The Hustler” which featured the band with fitted suits, smoking cigars and placing bets in a pool hall. His 1970 album “Cosa Nuestra” featured Colón smoking a cigar while overlooking a dead body in broad daylight in Manhattan’s East River Bikeway. Most famously, his 1971 album, “La Gran Fuga,” depicted the singer on a fake FBI “Most Wanted” poster.
These mob-like depictions occurred long before cult-favorite films like Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 “The Godfather” and Brian De Palma 1983’s “Scarface” became the prominent gangster storylines various male acts venerate in their music.
By 1973, Colón and Lavoe split — allegedly due to Lavoe’s drug addiction leading to many missed concert performances — although the two would remain frequent collaborators until the latter’s death in 1993 due to complications of AIDS.
The Nuyorican musician would introduce Blades as the new singer of his orchestra, whom he had met years prior while visiting Panama during carnivals. They collaborated briefly on Colón’s 1975 LP “The Good, the Bad, the Ugly,” cementing their partnership in the 1977 album “Metiendo Mano,” which delved into socio-political themes, notably in their track “Pablo Pueblo,” which shares the story of a working class man with broken dreams halted by toils of daily life. Other tracks like “Plantación Adentro,” detailed the story of Camilo Manrique, a fictionalized enslaved character who died at the hands of a Spanish colonizer in 1745.
Many considered this album Colón’s first foray into intellectual salsa — in large part because of Blades, who had a knack for storytelling and political interests (he unsuccessfully ran for president of Panama in 1994) — that addressed colonialism and class disparities. Together they released three albums, including their 1978 “Siembra,” one of the bestselling salsa albums at that time; from the start, their track “Plastico” fused the popular disco music of the moment while addressing superficial beauty standards and colorism in Latin America.
According to 1996 reporting by The Times, “Siembra” delivered pulsating salsa rhythms that “carried messages of freedom at a time when most of Latin America was oppressed by military dictatorships.”
By 1982, Blades and Colón parted ways, but they collaborated again on projects like their 2005 LP “Tras La Tormenta” — which led the bandleader to sing for the first time in his career, “I had to start from zero, and it took me many years to feel comfortable,” Colón said.
This newfound independence gave rise to some of Colón’s most famous songs, including his 1995 track “Talento de Televisión,” an upbeat song with his signature trombone wailing in the backdrop as he sang about an attractive woman with a lack of talent.
Many across Latin America might be familiar with his 1989 song “El Gran Varon” — which narrated the story of a trans woman who is rejected by her father and presumably dies of AIDS — a landmark salsa song that brought awareness to LGBTQ+ themes during the AIDS crisis. Colón would later serve as a member of the Latino Commission on AIDS. “El Gran Varon” is an anthem to this day.
Colón released more than 40 albums in all.
He also acted, taking roles in films including 1982’s “Vigilante,” the 1983 sports drama “The Last Fight,” as well as one-episode stints in TV shows like “Miami Vice” and “The Cosby Show.” He was even featured in Bad Bunny’s “Nuevayol” music video, cutting a slice of cake; the 31-year-old superstar pays homage to the singer in its lyrics: “Willie Colón, me dicen el malo, ey. Porque pasan los años y sigo dando palo”/ “Willie Colón, they say I’m bad, because the years come and I’m still hitting.”
In his later years, he became more involved in politics. In 1994, he unsuccessfully went up against U.S. Rep. Eliot Engel of the Bronx in the Democratic primary. He also ran as a Democrat for Public Advocate in 2001, focusing on community issues, education and AIDS awareness, but failed to gain the popular vote. In 2008, he endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton over Barack Obama in the primary election.
On May 26, 2014, after graduating from Westchester County Police Academy, Colón was sworn in as a deputy sheriff for the Department of Public Safety, later becoming deputy lieutenant.
As President Trump took office in his first term, Colón’s politics shifted in support of the right-wing candidate, and he said he would be open to performing at his inauguration in 2017.
Billboard magazine named him one of the most influential Latino artists of all time in 2018. Colón’s death sparked an outpouring of condolences across the Latin music world.
Oscar D’León, a Grammy-nominated salsa artist, frequently performed alongside Colón as the genre rose to prominence internationally. He hailed Colón as an architect of the genre.
“How difficult it is to say goodbye to a giant! Today, salsa mourns the passing of my great brother and colleague, Willie Colón,” D’León wrote in Spanish on Instagram.
“Willie, you leave an indelible legacy in each of us. That trombone of yours, with its rebellious and unique sound, forever changed the history of our Latin music. As a trombonist, you created a school, but as a composer and arranger, you were an absolute genius, a true architect of salsa. You are and always will be one of the greatest pillars of our genre.”
Grupo Niche, the legendary Colombian salsa orchestra, was one of many music groups across Latin America that praised Colón’s contribution to salsa music, extolling him as “an absolute icon of our culture.”
“Songs that marked generations, stories that became anthems, and an artistic force that transformed salsa forever,” a post on the orchestra’s Instagram said.
Marc Anthony, the best-selling salsa artist of all time who admired Colón, also offered a brief tribute on Instagram.
“Maestro, thank you for your legacy,” Anthony wrote in Spanish along with a photo of the two performing together. “Your music will live forever.”
Colón is survived by his wife, Julia Colón, and his four sons and grandsons.
Times staff writer Tony Briscoe contributed to this report.

Far-right anti-Islam march sparks counterprotests in Manchester
Hundreds of Britain First protesters faced larger antifascist crowds in a tense Manchester city centre standoff.
Manchester, United Kingdom – Chants of “send them back” echoed through a damp underpass as hundreds of far-right anti-Islam protesters prepared to march through the streets.
Union Jacks fluttered in the wind as protesters – some visibly under the influence of alcohol – chanted a series of anti-immigration slogans and derisive comments about British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

In response to the demonstration organised by Britain First, a far-right political party that calls for mass deportation and the removal of migrants and Muslims from the UK, a counterprotest was also planned for midday on Saturday.
It formed a much larger crowd made up of antifascist protesters who gathered a few streets away, carrying antiracist banners and waving an array of flags, including the Palestinian flag.
Ruby, 20, a student from South London, took a five-hour coach ride to show her support for the counterprotest and told Al Jazeera that attending was a “no-brainer”. She asked that her surname not be published, fearing repercussions.
‘A master race’
Ruby said her grandparents, originally from Montserrat, were part of the Windrush generation – immigrants invited to the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries – and, despite having given so much to their adopted country, are now feeling increasingly unwelcome.
She said her grandparents had told her they were witnessing a return to the levels of racism they experienced when they came to the country in the 1950s.
It was a sentiment echoed by Llowelyn, 16, a counter-protester from Wales who said her father, who is British Guyanese, has received more verbal abuse based on his race in the past few years than at any other point.
The tension was palpable before the two marches were due to begin, with far-right agitators livestreaming to their followers as they entered the area assigned to the counterprotest.
John – a stocky, tenacious counter-protester from Wales – confronted them with arms outstretched as police officers looked on.
“They come here to cause a ruckus and make money of it online, but I come here to protect the left. These guys [far-right agitators] try and intimidate … minorities because they think they are a master race”, he told Al Jazeera.
As the Britain First march began, flanked by police and led by Paul Golding, a portly, combative far-right activist who has previously been imprisoned for religiously aggravated harassment, the celebratory mood quickly turned aggressive as they came across counter-protesters in the city centre.
“Leftie scum,” screamed one member of the Britain First crowd as they harassed three young people who staged a sit-down, forcing riot police to encircle and pull them to safety.
‘Divisive, racist positions’
The two marches finally met in an expletive-ridden crushendo as police struggled to hold ranks.
Britain First protesters prodded counter-protesters with flag poles, and some slipped through the porous police lines as they shouted anti immigration and anti-Palestine slogans.
A number of counterprotesters and bystanders expressed frustration that the police allowed the march to go ahead.
“We, as Jews and internationalists, are having to confront Britain First, the fascists who are organising on the streets, who have been permitted to market their divisive, racist, dictatorial positions on our streets,” Pia Feig, of Jewish Action for Palestine, told Al Jazeera.
Audrey, a teacher and counterprotester who was pushed away by police after being shoved by a Britain First protester, said the police always “protected” the far-right groups.
A police officer told Al Jazeera that the day required extensive planning and was a particularly difficult operation, as the two groups kept changing their planned route.
He said on condition of anonymity that handling the two conflicting protests, a rally in support of Ukraine, and managing crowds at large football fixtures held this weekend had stretched the local police force thin.

UK royals face worst crisis in generations as Epstein fallout leads to ex-prince’s arrest
Expert says family has ‘no clear route forward’ after Andrew becomes first senior royal to be arrested since the 1640s
LONDON (AP) — King Charles III’ s brother was under arrest. Police were searching two royal properties, and news commentators were endlessly discussing the details of a sex scandal with tentacles that stretched to the gates of Buckingham Palace.
So how did Britain’s royal family spend Thursday afternoon? The king sat in the front row on the first day of London Fashion Week. Queen Camilla attended a lunchtime concert, and Princess Anne visited a prison.
The decision to continue normal royal duties was more than just an example of British stoicism in the face of the monarchy’s biggest crisis in almost a century.
It was the opening act of the House of Windsor’s fight for survival as the arrest of the former prince Andrew threatens to undermine public backing for the monarchy.
After pledging to support the police investigation into his brother’s friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the king stressed his intentions.
“My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” he said in a statement signed “Charles R.,” using the abbreviation for Rex, the Latin word for king.
Biggest crisis since 1936 abdication
The simple fact that Charles made the statement showed the scale of the problem created by the arrest of the king’s 66-year-old sibling, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was held for 11 hours and then released under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.
The event was so unprecedented that commentators had to reach back to the 1640s and the arrest and execution of King Charles I during the English Civil War to find a parallel.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office is shaping up to be the monarchy’s biggest crisis since Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.
That scandal weakened public support for the monarchy, which did not fully recover for 15 years. The turnaround came only after Edward’s successor, King George VI, refused to flee Britain during World War II, demonstrating his solidarity with a nation ravaged by Nazi bombs.
Even before she ascended the throne, Queen Elizabeth II followed her father’s lead and publicly pledged her life in service to Britain.
But while the impact of Edward’s abdication lingered for years, the crisis reached a crescendo in a few days. And the solution in that case was relatively simple: Edward stepped aside, and his oldest brother took his place.
By contrast, the drama surrounding Mountbatten-Windsor is ongoing, with no end in sight.
No ‘clear route forward’
The current crisis stems from revelations about the relationship between the former prince and Epstein that were uncovered when the US Justice Department released millions of pages of documents last month from its investigation into Epstein.
Police have previously cited reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade information to Epstein, a wealthy investor, in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade.
At least eight UK police forces have said they are looking into issues raised by the documents.
Compared with previous royal scandals, “this time there doesn’t seem to be any clear route forward,’’ said Ed Owens, author of “After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?” “There’s no blueprint to follow” in terms of how the monarchy and associated organizations deal with the allegations.
The last time the monarchy had to manage these kinds of questions was after the death of Princess Diana, Charles’ ex-wife. Elizabeth and Charles were criticized for failing to respond to the outpouring of public grief as tens of thousands of people swarmed to Kensington Gardens to lay flowers outside the late princess’ home. Some even called for Charles to step aside as heir to the throne in favor of his son William.
The queen later commissioned focus groups to better understand the public mood and determine why people felt so strongly about a person they never met. The crisis forced the royals to recognize that Diana’s common touch had connected with people in ways that had not yet occurred to the House of Windsor.
Those lessons have since inspired other royals, including Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, to be more informal and approachable.
But this moment is different, in part because it is taking place in a rapidly changing media environment at a time when people are demanding transparency from their leaders.
Family could face uncomfortable questions
Moving forward also means facing uncomfortable questions about what the institution — and the family members themselves — may have known about Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities. The palace has sought to draw a bold line separating the former prince and the rest of the monarchy by stripping him of his titles, including the right to be called a prince.
In another blow for the former prince, the British government is considering formally removing him from the line of succession to the crown. Despite losing his status and his honors, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. That can only be changed with legislation.
Charles is the first monarch “that has to meet our expectations of figures in public life, which is to be accountable and to explain yourself,” said Craig Prescott, a royal expert at Royal Holloway, University of London. “And you always have to work to earn the support of the public. And that is a particular challenge when you’re facing a controversy such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.”
Critics argue that the monarchy was slow to respond to the pressure, given that Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Epstein have been discussed for more than a decade.
The best outcome for the monarchy is for the police investigation to focus solely on the information in the Epstein files and how that relates to Mountbatten-Windsor, said Peter Hunt, a former BBC royal correspondent. The worst outcome would be if police expand their inquiries to what the broader institution might have known and when.
“Were questions raised about his behavior as a trade envoy over those 10 years? Were they answered? What did people do about them?’’ Hunt said on the BBC.
And perhaps there’s more to learn.
“Will there be files?’’ he asked.
If so, we have a request.

What is the rules-based order and is Trump really threatening it?

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared that the rules-based international order "no longer exists", he joined a growing chorus of global leaders issuing similar warnings.
In his opening speech at the Munich Security Conference last weekend, Merz told other world leaders that "our freedom is not guaranteed" and the world had returned to an era of "big power politics".
His remarks echoed those of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who weeks earlier told the World Economic Forum in Davos that the world was in the "midst of a rupture, not a transition".
Carney warned that middle powers, such as Australia and Canada, needed to work more closely together because "if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu".
"Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is — a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests, using economic integration as coercion," Carney said.
While neither leader mentioned US President Donald Trump by name, both speeches came amid a widening rift between the United States and its Western allies.
Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about annexing Greenland — a territory of Denmark — along with his use of tariffs and criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance have shaken confidence in the post-World War Two global order.
As Trump issued a new threat to Iran this week, that a deal on nuclear must be reached within 10 days, he raised the risk he will act in disregard of the wishes of the UN Security Council, on which the US is a permanent member.
SBS News spoke with two geopolitical experts who had differing opinions on whether Merz and Carney accurately described the decline of the rules-based order or overstated the crisis.
What is the rules-based order and is it being challenged?
The rules-based order refers to the international system in which countries interact according to agreed rules, norms and multilateral institutions rather than through force or coercion.
Established after World War Two and led by the United States, the system promotes free trade, security cooperation and sovereignty of states.
Tom Chodor, a senior lecturer in politics and international relations at Monash University, told SBS News the US has historically underpinned the system through what he described as a "hegemonic approach".
"Hegemony is a basis for a rules-based order, because you need one state that's more powerful than everyone else but willing to compromise and to offer concessions," he said.
While authoritarian states have long challenged the system, most notably by the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War, Chodor argues it is now the US that is upending the order.
"It's imposing its will on other countries and not offering them much in return if they agree to do what the US wants them to do," he said.
Trump has pulled out of dozens of international organisations and agreements, questioned the purpose of the United Nations and set up a US-led Board of Peace to implement a peace plan for Gaza.
The US has also expanded its military presence near the Middle East in recent weeks, raising the prospect of new strikes on Iran, following last year's attack on Iranian nuclear facilities — an action some experts argued breached international law.
Australian National University professor Donald Rothwell said Trump was not authorised by the UN to attack Iran last year, therefore violating its charter, and also acting in violation of the clause on the right to self-defence.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also challenged the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the rules-based order.
Meanwhile, the rise of China and its expanding global influence have disrupted the post–Cold War era in which the US stood as the sole superpower.
Although middle powers could attempt to uphold the rules-based order without the US, Chodor said that it becomes far more difficult when major powers actively undermine those efforts.
He cited a proposed International Maritime Organization plan that would have required shipping companies to pay a levy on carbon dioxide emissions.
While most countries backed the regulation, a final vote scheduled last October was postponed for a year amid US pressure, including threats of tariffs, sanctions and visa restrictions against countries that supported the measures.
"You can negotiate nice rules amongst yourselves, but if the most powerful country attacks those rules ... that system you negotiate can’t function," Chodor said.
Chodor said Australia was particularly exposed to a "shakedown" from the US through security arrangements such as AUKUS, which will see Australia acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines through the trilateral partnership with the US and United Kingdom.
"If the US suddenly decides that they want us to pay $15 billion into the shipping industry ... we really don't have an option but to say yes, because without that, our capacity to project force collapses," he said.
He said the alliance also meant Australia was less likely to speak out against the US when it undermined the rules-based order, damaging Australia's credibility with other countries.
'More robust, more enduring'
Not everyone agrees that the system is in terminal decline.
Dr John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies and director of the Australian National University’s North America Liaison Office, told SBS News the rules-based order was more robust than it was credited for.
He said countries continued to follow rules governing trade resolution, international transactions and maritime regulation.
"These are things you can mock, you can say 'it's all over'," he said.
"They're still functioning .... we all have a vested interest in that continuing, even the United States.
"The rules-based order is, in fact, more robust, more enduring, more profound than people are prepared to give acknowledgement to."
Unless there was a global conflict, Blaxland believed it was unlikely that a fully fractured multi-polar world would emerge, noting that countries are more interconnected than ever before.
He noted China's rise, a counter-weight to US dominance, had occurred during the era of globalisation and was underpinned by the rules-based order.
"It has been a huge beneficiary of that order, and has shown no signs of wanting to destroy it," he said.
A day after Merz’s speech, Blaxland noted US secretary of state Marco Rubio's address to the Munich conference struck a far more conciliatory tone towards Europe than Trump’s earlier rhetoric.
Rubio said Europe and the US "belong together", reassuring allies it was "neither our goal nor our wish" to end the transatlantic partnership.
"We do not need to abandon the system of international cooperation we authored, and we don't need to dismantle the global institutions of the old order that together we built. But these must be reformed. These must be rebuilt," Rubio said.
Blaxland described the speech as a "circuit breaker" and could signal the repairing of US and European relations.

Merz says will travel to US with EU’s agreed position to discuss tariffs

BERLIN, February 21. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has announced his plans to travel to Washington to discuss with US President Donald Trump the situation around US tariffs.
"This is an interesting decision that many had been expecting: the Supreme Court in Washington has pointed out the limits of the administration's powers in matters of customs policy," Merz said in an interview with ARD television after the Christian Democratic Union convention in Stuttgart. He clarified that the verdict does not concern sectoral duties, but rather the general tariff rate.
According to Merz, his talks with the US president will be preceded by consultations with the European Union to elaborate "an absolutely clear European position." "Customs policy is the European Union’s competence, not of its individual member states. I will travel to Washington with an agreed European position," he stated.
"First and foremost, these (tariffs - TASS) harm the country that imposes them," he emphasized. Germany, in his words, is also feeling the strain, as it is supplying fewer goods. "But in the end, it is consumers in the US who will have to pay more," Merz explained, calling the US court's verdict positive news. "The separation of powers in the US still seems to be functioning, and that is good news."
According to the Bild newspaper, the German chancellor will visit the United States in early March. His meeting with President Donald Trump is scheduled for March 3.
he US Supreme Court on Friday ruled that the US president had exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on other countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, the highest court did not clarify whether the US should refund the money previously paid as tariffs. Following the court verdict, Trump signed an executive order imposing 10% tariffs on imports from all countries. The tariffs will take effect on February 24 and remain in force for 150 days.

Far Left protest planned against Buchenwald Memorial on Liberation Day

A planned far-left protest against the Buchenwald concentration camp memorial on the anniversary of its liberation has sparked outrage across Germany, with officials denouncing the move as an affront to the memory of Holocaust victims.
According to a report in the German Bild, citing Switzerland's Neue Zürcher Zeitung, radical organizations are calling for demonstrations on April 11, the day the camp was liberated in 1945. The groups accuse the memorial's management of "spreading Israeli propaganda" and of not being "hostile enough toward Israel."
The protest is being organized under the slogan "Keffiyehs in Buchenwald." Among those involved are the student wing of Germany's Left Party (Die Linke), the anti-Israel group Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East and the German Communist Party (DKP).
In statements published by the organizers, the Buchenwald memorial site is accused of promoting "historical revisionism and genocide denial" and of serving as a vehicle for advancing an alleged "Israeli narrative."
The controversy follows an incident last year in which a woman seeking to stage a protest at the site while wearing a keffiyeh, a scarf widely associated with Palestinian nationalism, was denied entry. A German court later upheld the decision. The protest organizers claim the memorial's management is effectively criminalizing pro-Palestinian activists.
According to the report, one of the leading activists behind the campaign belongs to a communist organization that previously expressed public support for the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas. In a statement issued after the attack, the group described it as a "legitimate uprising by all means necessary."
The remarks triggered widespread public anger in Germany, particularly given Buchenwald's central place in the country's culture of remembrance. Tens of thousands of Jews were murdered at the camp during the Holocaust, making it one of the most significant symbols of Nazi atrocities.
Felix Klein, the German government's commissioner for combating antisemitism, sharply condemned the initiative, calling it "a new low in the reversal of roles between victim and perpetrator." He described the planned demonstration as "a frontal assault on the dignity of commemoration and on the memory of the victims of the Holocaust."
The Buchenwald Memorial Foundation also voiced concern over what it called an attempt "to exploit the memory of the camp for contemporary political purposes," stressing that the site is committed to preserving historical memory and opposing all forms of antisemitism or incitement.

In Ukraine, Olga and Sasha's never-ending war: 'When it's time to go to bed, I start to hear the sound of little drums in my head; it's the percussion of fear'

Olga and I arranged to meet at a café in Paris, near the Bastille metro station, the same place where we had met so many times over the past four years. The décor had not changed. She had. Sitting here, I had seen her wracked with worry, angry, tears in her eyes or a smile on her lips. She sometimes came alone, sometimes with her son, who was almost two years old. Her hair had been short. On this February day, it was pulled back in a long ponytail streaked with silver. Time had passed. Far too much time spent talking about the war, the horrible din of which gripped her insides. The fighting was 2,000 kilometers away, but that was qhere her loved ones were, so her heart was there, too.
"It's silly," Olga said softly, "but when I wake up in the morning, I realize the war is still there, I can't escape that thought. I feel like we're trapped in this hopeless time. But it's very difficult to make people who aren't living it understand. Is it even possible to understand it without experiencing it?"
When, in the early days of the Russian invasion in February 2022, I suggested that each of them keep a war diary between France and Ukraine, none of us imagined they would still be recounting their daily lives 1,500 days later. Sasha in Kyiv, Olga in Paris, where she has been living since 2016. In these thousands of lines, they have not always written about the latest war news. Olga and Sasha also told us about the Ukrainian language, about poetry, about their childhood memories, their family history, their loves, the birth of their little boys, Zakary and Marian. As if to catch their breath between air raid alerts, lethal drones, sham negotiations, friends leaving for the front, and the heating and electricity that grew scarcer with each passing day – so many abnormal things that had become familiar.

Trump to hike global tariffs to 15% from 10%, 'effective immediately'

President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would increase global tariffs to 15% from 10%, one day after the Supreme Court struck down a broad swath of the president's trade agenda.
In a Truth Social post, Trump said the new tariffs will be "effective immediately." He also warned that additional levies would follow.
"I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been "ripping" the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level," he wrote.
"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs," he added.
Trump's announcement claimed that the new tariffs will take effect without delay, but it is unclear if any official documents have been signed detailing the timing. A White House fact sheet issued Friday said the original 10% tariffs would go into effect on Tuesday, Feb. 24, at 12:01 a.m. ET.
The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for clarification.
Trump, who is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, was dealt a blow Friday when the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 tariff ruling that the president wrongfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement his levies.
On Friday, Trump responded hours after the ruling with a 10% global tariff that he invoked under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. The statute allows the president to impose temporary levies for 150 days. Any extension requires congressional approval.
The president was scathing in his remarks against the Supreme Court decision, calling the ruling "ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American" in a social media post.
He also attacked Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett after they voted with the majority in the ruling.
Congressional Democrats rejoiced following the decision, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying in a statement that the tariffs were "chaotic and illegal." Tariffs and the broader economy are expected to be key issues for the Democrats on the campaign trail for this year's midterm elections in November.
Republicans were more divided on the issue. Some slammed the Supreme Court for its decision, while others argued that Congress has the constitutional authority to implement levies.
On Friday, stocks rallied initially following the Supreme Court decision, before pulling back and then recovering again. Investors expect the ruling could allay tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, and possibly refund affected companies and reduce inflation.
How the U.S. government will proceed with refunds remains a question. By one estimate, the U.S. government could owe more than $175 billion in refunds to importers following the Supreme Court decision.

FIFA chief’s Board of Peace appearance doesn’t breach political neutrality rules — IOC
Gianni Infantino, who has repeatedly met with Trump, is working on soccer-based ‘sport recovery investment program in Gaza’ that keeps with Olympic mission, says Games’ global body
MILAN, Italy (Reuters) — FIFA president Gianni Infantino’s presence at the inaugural meeting of The Board of Peace this week alongside United States President Donald Trump and other heads of state does not violate any Olympic Charter rules on political neutrality, the International Olympic Committee said on Saturday.
The boss of global soccer’s governing body, who is also an IOC member, took part in Thursday’s meeting of the Board of Peace, which is focusing on reconstruction work in Gaza and aims to rebuild the territory once Hamas disarms.
“The IOC has been in contact with FIFA,” an IOC spokesperson said. “We understand that FIFA is supporting, through football, a comprehensive sport recovery investment program in Gaza, Palestine, by providing sporting infrastructure, education and elite development proposals.”
“This is entirely in keeping with the role of an international sport federation. The IOC, through Olympic Solidarity, which is our development vehicle, has been and continues to support sport development in the region,” the spokesperson said.
The Olympic Charter states that members must always act independently of commercial and political interests. They also cannot accept “from governments, organizations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote,” the Charter says.
Trump’s Board of Peace has been controversial. It includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives, and Trump’s suggestion that the Board could eventually address challenges beyond Gaza has stirred anxiety that it could undermine the UN’s role as the main platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution.
Infantino appeared on stage with several heads of state, sported a red hat with “USA” on the front and the numbers 45-47, for the two non-consecutive presidencies of Trump.
Infantino also displayed the FIFA collaboration agreement with the Board of Peace, which includes building 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy and a new 20,000-seat national stadium.
Trump has met Infantino several times, with the United States set to co-host this summer’s soccer World Cup along with Mexico and Canada.
The US President was also awarded FIFA’s inaugural peace prize in December for his efforts to promote dialogue and de-escalation in some of the world’s biggest hotspots, the soccer body said at the time.
IOC President Kirsty Coventry, elected in 2025, has not yet met Trump. The 2028 Summer Olympics are due to be held in Los Angeles.

Italian broadcaster apologizes after commentator calls to ‘avoid’ Israeli bobsleigh team
RAI Sport’s interim director says on-air remark during Winter Olympics coverage was ‘unacceptable’ and that an internal review has already been launched
Amy Spiro is a reporter and writer with The Times of Israel
Israel’s Olympic bobsleigh team has once again found itself in the center of controversy, following remarks made by an Italian commentator on the RAI public broadcaster during competition on Saturday.
The comments were followed by an immediate apology from RAI’s executives and a promise to fully investigate the incident, less than a week after a similar incident with Swiss commentators garnered intensive media coverage.
In the off-camera comment ahead of Saturday’s four-man bobsleigh event in Cortina, an Italian commentator said: “Let’s avoid crew 21, which is Israeli.” It is not clear if the remark was a “hot mic” comment not meant to air, or if the commentator intended to say it during the live broadcast.
Shortly after the comments aired, Marco Lollobrigida, the interim director of RAI Sport, issued a statement apologizing and promising to investigate the incident.
“The off-air remark that was broadcast before the four-man bobsleigh race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on RAI 2 contained an unacceptable expression that in no way represents the values of public service broadcasting or of RAI Sport,” said Lollobrigida. “On behalf of the directorate, I extend sincere apologies to the Israeli athletes, the delegation, and all viewers. Immediate internal reviews have been launched to determine responsibility. Sport must unite, not divide.”
Lollobrigida only just took over the role, after the previous RAI Sport director, Paolo Petrecca, resigned on Thursday following his gaffe-ridden commentary of the Olympic opening ceremony, in which he misidentified a number of public figures and made racially insensitive comments about several athletes.
Giampaolo Rossi, the managing director of RAI, also issued an apology on Saturday, saying that the incident during the bobsleigh commentary runs “contrary to the principles of impartiality, respect and inclusion that must characterize public service broadcasting,” adding that a probe will be “aimed at initiating disciplinary proceedings.”
Last week, during the Israel team’s run in the two-man bobsleigh event, a Swiss commentator came under fire after he used the entirety of the team’s run to berate captain AJ Edelman’s support of Zionism and Israel, and question if he should have been allowed to compete at the Olympics at all.
Swiss broadcaster RTS later pulled the clip from its digital platforms, saying that while the commentary was “factual,” its “length” was not appropriate for a sporting event.
On Wednesday, the Olympic Committee of Israel demanded RTS issue an apology and consider removing the commentator, Stefan Renna, from future broadcasts.
In response to a request for comment from The Times of Israel, a spokesperson for RTS said that “in the interest of journalistic rigor, we will clarify with our editorial teams the appropriate format for sports commentary. We regret that this episode may have caused offense.”
Ahead of Saturday’s runs, Edelman wrote on X: “In case there are any Swiss commentators waiting for their opportunity today — anything you quote me as saying about Zionism or how just Israel is, I’m proud I said. Thank you for spreading the message.”
The Winter Olympics will wrap up on Sunday with only a few events left to be contested, including the decisive heats in the four-man bobsleigh event.
Following Saturday’s first two heats, Israel is in 24th place out of the 27 teams, after three of them crashed mid-course and did not finish the race. Only the top 20 teams will advance to the fourth heat.
Israeli skier Barnabas Szollos will represent Israel as its flag-bearer during Sunday night’s closing ceremony, accompanied by the bobsleigh team’s athletes.

Berlin Film Festival closes after being beset by ‘stormy seas’ of Gaza war

Palestinian Berlinale awardee to German government: ‘You are partners in the genocide’
Film festival’s closing ceremony continues to be marred by protests over jury president’s refusal to condemn Israel, after weeklong event was beset by ‘stormy seas’ of Gaza war
“Yellow Letters,” directed by German filmmaker Ilker Catak, won the Berlin Film Festival’s Golden Bear for best film Saturday, at a ceremony reflecting the controversy over Gaza that has dogged this year’s edition.
Some award winners spoke out in favor of the Palestinian cause and accused Israel of “genocide,” pushing back after jury president Wim Wenders had sparked outrage earlier by trying to steer the festival away from the issue.
Festival director Tricia Tuttle acknowledged Saturday that this year’s edition had been “emotionally charged” after days of sometimes acrimonious debate on how far filmmaking should intervene in politics.
Catak’s film tells the story of a Turkish director and his actor wife, suddenly barred from working because of their political opinions.
Wenders called the film “a terrifying premonition, a look into the near future that could possibly happen in our countries as well.”
While set in Turkey, the film was shot in Germany, an artistic choice to make the point that threats to liberty are universal.
The runner-up Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize went to “Salvation” by Emin Alper, who in his speech expressed solidarity with several high-profile opposition figures in prison in Turkey, including jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Alper’s film, inspired by a true story, shows the consequences of a feud over land between two clans in a remote mountain village.
He took the opportunity to speak up for “the people of Iran suffering under tyranny” and “Kurds in Rojava and the Middle East struggling for their rights for almost a century — you are not alone.”
Alper also spoke of “the Palestinians in Gaza living and dying under the most terrible conditions.”
‘Partners in genocide’
Alper was not the only award-winner to express support for the Palestinians.
Syrian-Palestinian director Abdullah Al-Khatib won Best First Feature Award for “Chronicles From the Siege.”
He accepted the award with a keffiyeh draped over his shoulder and gave an impassioned speech in which he addressed the German government by claiming: “You are partners in the genocide in Gaza by Israel.”
He received cheers for his words but also prompted some heckling, reflecting the tension over Gaza that has often overshadowed this year’s event.
Speaking at a press conference at the beginning of the festival last week, Wenders answered a question about the German government’s support for Israel by saying: “We cannot really enter the field of politics.”
At the same press conference, he had said that films had the power to “change the world” but in a different way from politics.
But his comments in response to the question on Israel prompted a storm of outrage.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wenders’ words “unconscionable” and “jaw-dropping.”
On Tuesday, an open letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton and director Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival’s “silence on the genocide of Palestinians” and accused it of being involved in “censoring” artists who oppose Israel’s war against Hamas, which was sparked by the Palestinian terror group’s onslaught of October 7, 2023.
Israel bitterly denies allegations of genocide. It has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas, including homes, hospitals, schools and mosques.
Tuttle, in her second year at the helm of the Berlinale, has firmly rejected the accusations, describing some of the claims in the letter as “misinformation” and “inaccurate.”
Speaking on Saturday at the awards ceremony for prizes from the festival’s Independent Juries, Tuttle described the past 10 days as “stormy seas.”
Wenders addressed the controversy on Saturday.
“The language of cinema is empathetic. The language of social media is effective,” he said.
Addressing political activists, he said: “All of us applaud you. You do necessary and courageous work.”
“But does it need to be in competition with us? Do our languages need to clash?” he asked.
Meanwhile, Mexican director Fernando Eimbcke, whose film “Moscas” (Flies) was in official competition, used the occasion to protest civilian deaths in Gaza as well as US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
“More than 17,000 kids have been killed in Gaza in the last two years,” he said, citing Hamas health ministry data, which cannot be verified and does not differentiate between combatants and civilians.
“I should raise my voice and I ask all the governments and organizations to raise their voices too,” he said.
He also referenced the arrest of a five-year-old Ecuadorian boy by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which sparked widespread outrage.
“ICE should stop persecuting and terrifying kids like Liam Conejo Ramos — ICE out!” Eimbcke said.
‘Queen at Sea’
Other award winners on Saturday included German actress Sandra Hueller, who received the Silver Bear for Best Performance for her title role in Markus Schleinzer’s “Rose.”
The black-and-white drama tells the story of a woman passing herself off as a man in rural 17th-century Germany to escape the constraints of patriarchy.
“Queen at Sea” by American director Lance Hammer, which stars Juliette Binoche as a woman caring for her mother with dementia, picked up two awards.
The film portrays the devastation Alzheimer’s disease inflicts on a patient’s loved ones.
Tom Courtenay, 88, and 79-year-old Anna Calder-Marshall, who plays the ailing mother in the film, shared the Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.
The film also picked up the Silver Bear Jury Prize, considered the third most prestigious award.

Airlines canceled more than 5,000 flights through Monday and waived cancellation and change fees for airports spanning Virginia to Maine ahead of another massive winter storm on the East Coast, set to once again put carriers to the test at the tail-end of winter break.
The National Weather Service issued a blizzard warning for much of New Jersey, the New York City area, and parts of Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The storm could dump more than 2 feet of snow in some areas as well as bring wind gusts of more than 40 miles per hour. The NWS warned that travel will be trecherous with low visibility.
About two-thirds of the flights to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport were canceled on Sunday as were around 40% of the departures, according to FlightAware. Disruptions are set to worsen on Monday with snow continuining to fall. More than 70% of Monday departures were canceled at Boston Logan International Airport.
Airlines routinely cancel flights ahead of major storms to avoid having aircraft and crews out of place and to make it easier to restart operations after the storm passes.
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines and Spirit Airlines waived fees and fare differences for passengers if they can travel as late as Feb. 26. Southwest Airlines said customers are eligible for a change without paying a difference in fare if they can rebook to fly or fly standby within two weeks.
Winter Storm Fern in January, followed by bitter cold, caused mass travel disruptions across a large swath of the U.S.
American Airlines had struggled to recover, drawing harsh criticism from flight crews, some of whom were stranded and had to sleep at airports, heightening tension between frontline employees and the company's CEO, Robert Isom.
The storm cost American between $150 million and $200 million in revenue, the carrier said last month on an earnings call.

The new space race: how satellites are reshaping Germany's defence

Germany is rearming — and not only on Earth. Last year, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius earmarked around €35 billion for space capabilities. Inspector Thomas Daum explains why space has become a new battlefield.
As the world's security landscape changes, space is no longer seen simply as a domain for research and commerce, but also as a central pillar of Germany's national security and military deterrence.
According to the Inspector of Cyber and Information Domain of the German Armed Forces, Vice Admiral Dr Thomas Daum, space has now become a battlefield in its own right.
The Bundeswehr currently operates between eight and ten satellites, primarily for reconnaissance – including the SAR-Lupe and SARah systems – as well as for communications. This fleet is now considered outdated, though.
Speaking to Euronews at the Munich Security Conference, Daum said satellites are of "considerable importance for the functioning of our systems on the ground" and extend far beyond purely military use. "If satellites fail, you wouldn't be able to withdraw cash," he said. There is a risk that "our systems in space could be attacked".
Against that backdrop, a "day without space" – in other words, a large-scale satellite failure – would, he warned, "essentially be a disaster". Such an attack would deliberately disable satellites, with immediate consequences on the ground, severely disrupting critical infrastructure and key services.
Deterrence in orbit
As in other areas of defence, Berlin's answer is deterrence. Last September, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius pledged roughly €35 billion by 2030, part of it earmarked for a space-based reconnaissance capability known as "SPOCK", which the Bundeswehr has been using since the start of the year.
The system, built by the Finnish firm Iceye in partnership with Germany's Rheinmetall, relies on a network of radar satellites using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Unlike optical satellites, they can capture images of the Earth's surface in all weather and around the clock – tracking movements and changes on the ground regardless of cloud cover or darkness.
For Daum, deterrence in space follows the same logic as on land, at sea or in the air: capability signals intent. If you show you can operate – and interfere – in orbit, you signal that an adversary's systems are not beyond reach.
That does not necessarily mean blowing satellites out of the sky. In practice, so-called non-kinetic measures are often more relevant. Optical reconnaissance satellites, for instance, can be temporarily "blinded" from the ground by dazzling their sensors. These satellites rely on high-resolution cameras or telescopes; disrupt the sensor, and the satellite cannot see.
Another method is jamming – transmitting interference signals to disrupt communications satellites. The hardware remains intact, but its usefulness is degraded. "The impact is felt on the ground," Daum said. "If a reconnaissance satellite can't track the movement of your forces, you gain a tactical advantage."
Sustainability - even in space
There are political reasons, too, why these capabilities are deliberately designed to avoid causing physical destruction. Germany signed up to the US-led Artemis Accords in 2023, committing itself to the principle of not creating space debris.
In practical terms, that means an adversary's satellite cannot simply be shot down. The emphasis instead is on reversible measures – limiting or disrupting its use without leaving fragments in orbit. For now, that remains the official line.
But, according to Daum, there are political voices beginning to question the so-called "zero debris" principle. "Just because we have the capability to destroy a system doesn't mean we would use it," he told Euronews.
At the same time, he argues, demonstrating that capability sends a message. Signalling that "we possess the same capabilities as our adversaries" feeds into the logic of deterrence by punishment – the idea that an opponent must factor in the risk of retaliation.
"That can of course have a deterrent effect," Daum said. "But it would ultimately require an adjustment of our space security strategy – and that is a political decision."
A network of thousands of small satellites
Beyond reconnaissance, secure and resilient communications are just as critical – in peacetime as well as during crises. The Bundeswehr is heavily dependent on satellite communications. For long-distance links, it has so far relied largely on geostationary satellites, either its own or leased capacity.
If, for example, a German warship deploys from Europe to Africa, communications are routed through this infrastructure, Daum explained. The project known as "SATCOMBw Stage 4" represents the largest single space programme in the Bundeswehr's history. Its aim is to connect tanks, ships, aircraft and troops worldwide via satellite communications – and, in particular, to secure operations on NATO's eastern flank, including the permanently stationed German brigade in Lithuania.
Yet SATCOMBw remains a conventional system built around a small number of large satellites. It is not comparable to constellations such as Starlink, which are made up of thousands of small, interconnected satellites in low Earth orbit. Rather than relying on a handful of high-value assets, Starlink operates a dense network of smaller units that communicate with one another.
This creates far more access points and significantly increases resilience and flexibility. The strategic value of such systems has become especially clear in the war in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine have, to varying degrees, relied on the satellite network operated by SpaceX in recent years – particularly for coordinating and operating drones.
Officially, Starlink services were not authorised for use in Russia. Nevertheless, from 2023 onwards, Starlink terminals began appearing with Russian units, reportedly entering the country via intermediaries in the Gulf or Central Asia.
Over the past two weeks, SpaceX has moved to block Russian forces from accessing Starlink services. Ukraine has said the restrictions have "significantly impaired" Russian operations. Moscow denies this, insisting there has been no impact on its drone warfare capabilities.

Iran university students hold anti-regime rallies at campuses in Tehran, Mashhad
Head of top Tehran engineering school calls for criminals to be ‘dealt with’ after Basij officers reportedly clash with students, who greet them with calls of ‘death’ to Khamenei
Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans at rallies for people killed in the regime’s bloody crackdown on protesters last month, local and diaspora media reported Saturday, as groups opposed to the clerical leadership faced off with its supporters and security forces.
Videos geolocated by AFP to Tehran’s top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd as people shouted “bi sharaf,” or “disgraceful” in Farsi.
Footage posted by the Persian-language dissident TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
According to Iran International, protesters clashed with members of the regime’s Basij paramilitary force, chanting “death” to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and “long live the king,” referring to the monarchy toppled in Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a “silent and peaceful sit-in” of students killed last month was disrupted by people chanting anti-regime slogans. A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits. Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.
Iran International quoted Sharif University President Masoud Tajrishi calling for perpetrators of “illegal acts” to be “dealt with.”

“The enemy wants the university to become virtual, but we will not allow it,” Tajrishi was quoted as saying. “We want to show that we can manage the university. Anyone who carries out illegal acts at the university must be dealt with.”
Meanwhile, students at Tehran’s Beheshti University held a sit-in in solidarity with the people slain or imprisoned during the regime’s protest crackdown, according to a statement by the student union cited by Iran International.
And in the city’s Amirkabir University of Technology, demonstrators yelled “long live the king,” according to footage published by the outlet, which cited the student union later saying that security forces blocked the school’s exit and detained students.

— ايران اينترنشنال (@IranIntl) February 21, 2026
Other footage published by Iran International showed students at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences chanting “freedom.”
Iranians reprised their protest slogans this week to mark 40 days — the traditional Shiite mourning period — since the killing of thousands of protesters in a crackdown that peaked on January 8 and 9.
The unrest first broke out in December over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government demonstrations.

The death toll from the protests cannot be verified.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.
Iran International itself has put the death toll at over 36,000.
Iranian authorities, who have undercounted deaths in previous rounds of unrest suppressed by the regime, acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by “terrorist acts” fueled by Iran’s enemies.
The demonstrations came as Iran’s authorities are under pressure to make a deal on the country’s nuclear program with the United States, which has amassed forces within striking distance.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action against Iran, first over its protest crackdown last month and more recently over its failure to rein in its nuclear program.
“World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads… but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian declared Saturday in a speech carried live by state TV.

Prime Minister Robert Fico has said he will to cut off his country's emergency electricity supply to Ukraine unless Kyiv resumes pumping Russian oil to Slovakia.
Slovakia's prime minister Robert Fico has threatened to withdraw Ukraine's emergency electricity supply unless Russia's oil supply is restored to his country by Monday.
On a post on social media platform X on Saturday, Fico said that "if the West does not mind that the Nord Stream gas pipeline was blown up, Slovakia cannot accept Slovak-Ukrainian relations as a one-way ticket benefiting only Ukraine."
The pipeline has been cut off for almost a month now. Kyiv says it was damaged by a Russian drone strike.
"The Ukrainian president refuses to understand our peace-oriented approach and, because we do not support the war, he is behaving maliciously toward Slovakia," read Fico's post.
The threat comes just a day after Hungary said it will block a €90 billion emergency loan for Ukraine over the damaged pipeline. Both Slovakia and Hungary rely heavily on Russian oil and have close relation with Moscow. Fico also said his country will be rejecting the loan.
In a video posted on social media Friday evening, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart oil shipments.
Slovakia has become a key European supplier of electricity to Ukraine, filling the gap after Russian attacks severely damaged the country’s power grid.

The My Belarus achievements exhibition at the Minsk International Exhibition Center opened its doors on 19 December and will run until 23 February. The exposition is structured as a grand journey through the country - you can peek into every corner of it as a tourist, immerse yourself in traditions, and learn about the country’s achievements in all areas. Everyone finds something for themselves here, whether you are an admirer of history, a technology fanatic, or someone in love with nature. More than 440,000 people have visited My Belarus. It is more than last year. The exhibition attracted not only Belarusians from all regions of the country but also foreign guests. Which locations at the exhibition were particularly popular, why do many visitors return to the exhibition again and again, and why you shouldn't miss the chance to visit here before it closes in BelTA’s report.
‘Everything that is produced in Belarus’
The unprecedented popularity of the first edition of the My Belarus achievements exhibition last year demonstrated that Belarusians have something to be proud of and something to show. Visitors actively shared their impressions and left many reviews and wishes, which the organizers tried to take into account when preparing the exhibition this year. The new concept reflects the full diversity of Belarus’ achievements with an eye toward the future.
The main exhibition includes thematic zones dedicated to industry, science, medicine, sport, agriculture, the security/defense sector, and tourism. All of this is complemented by immersive technologies and augmented reality effects, virtual activities, and interactive stands.
The zone dedicated to science, space, and innovative technologies, showcases the latest scientific achievements in a historical context, from antiquity to the present day. Visitors are given the opportunity to get acquainted with a hundred developments in various fields of science: space technologies, microelectronics, laser technologies, food, agriculture, as well as to discover a completely new world of space exploration.
A separate zone is dedicated to electric power engineering, hybrid technologies, and peaceful atomic energy. Here you can learn about innovative technologies in the Belarusian energy sector, learn interesting facts about the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant, get acquainted with the Vitebsk Hydroelectric Power Plant and the Lukoml State District Power Plant, and examine the Belarusian electric vehicle.
Moreover, at the exhibition, every visitor can try their hand at various sports and sports entertainment, including those created with the help of innovative technologies: table tennis against a robot, a laser shooting range, various simulators, and tubing down a virtual hill. There is also an area for demonstration performances and an autograph session zone featuring Belarusian athletes and coaches.
The exhibition is particularly lively on weekends, but the number of visitors on weekdays is also impressive. The exhibition has become an excellent place for the whole family to relax - there is something to see for people of all ages.
“I keep telling my grandson – look, all of this is produced here, in Belarus. So that he understands and is proud of his country,” Nina Rusetskaya added.
The exhibition is also interesting for foreign guests - tourists who want to learn more about Belarus stop by. Official visitors also do not bypass My Belarus. For instance, the other day, a parliamentary delegation from Zimbabwe visited the exhibition. They were shown Belarusian agricultural machinery, as well as achievements in medicine and the defense industry.
Why is it worth visiting the exhibition several times?
The agricultural industry and biotechnology zone always draws crowds. It showcases the achievements of Belarusian agriculture and the food industry, tells about the geography of production, and the most delicious Belarusian products. Here you can learn what an agricultural drone is, the Digital Agronomist artificial intelligence system, and precision farming technology. Interactive exhibits and virtual games will help you dive deeper into all the technological processes.
The exhibition also features a zone dedicated to the achievements and developments of modern Belarusian medicine, the technological equipment of healthcare institutions. Here you can get acquainted with the software for the Smart Operating Room, Smart Intensive Care Unit, and advanced technologies in transplantology. Using interactive equipment and simulators, you can undergo training in providing first emergency aid and visit a retro pharmacy. There is also a corner for young visitors here. The medical theme attracts many guests.
A separate zone is dedicated to the tourism potential and historical-cultural heritage of the regions of Belarus. The Minsk city stand tells about modern achievements and innovations, and also shows the capital city of our country from different angles - a hero city, a city of hospitality, a city of cultural values, comfort, education, and advanced technologies. The Minsk Oblast stand features two VR stations with projects: Medieval Volozhin and Journey through Ancient Zaslavl. The training simulator complex of the self-propelled car of Belaruskali will transport you into a real mine. And at the Brest Oblast stand, you can be transported to the Brest Hero Fortress. The Grodno Oblast stand invites you to stroll along one of the oldest streets of this tourist city - Sovietskaya Street. It introduces you to iconic landmarks of Grodno, such as the Farny Church, the Kalozha Church, the Lutheran Church, and many others, with the help of an audio tour. A marathon of creativity and entertainment in the cultural projects zone also helps create a festive atmosphere and good mood. School student Anna Kobyak, together with friends, came to see My Belarus from Nesvizh District. This is the girl's second time at the exhibition. She liked it so much the first time that she wanted to return and stay longer. “It was very interesting to take part in various games, sit behind the wheel of a tractor, and see how everything inside an ambulance is arranged. We’ve already seen almost everything. I liked the medical stand the most, where they show how you can save a baby. Also, at the exhibition, you can be an archaeologist. Another interesting thing is the VR goggles; you can immerse yourself in virtual reality,” the girl noted
Students from the Minsk State Automobile Mechanics College came to the exhibition for the third time. They were particularly interested in everything related to technology. The young men are majoring in “maintenance of electronic systems of vehicles”. “It’s very interesting to be here, lots of people, lots of machinery. Tractors, combines, ATVs, motorcycles - we've seen and tried everything. We also went to see the tourism exhibition, which tells about the cities; that was also very interesting. We advise everyone to visit My Belarus; every time you come, you find something new, interesting, and beautiful,” Arseny Tarasik noted.
For some visitors, spending time at the exhibition has become a pleasant tradition. They visited it when it first opened its doors and didn’t miss the opportunity this time either. As Belexpo noted, My Belarus has resonated deeply in people's hearts; visitors have left the organizers many positive reviews and requests to hold the exhibition again next year. Perhaps the tradition will be continued in a new format.

KAMENETS DISTRICT, 21 February (BelTA) - The Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park celebrated Maslenitsa and bid farewell Snegurochka [Snow Maiden] until next winter, BelTA has learned.
The folk festivities took place on the grounds of the Archaeological Museum under the open sky. Games, contests, and amusements were organized for the guests. What is Maslenitsa without pancakes? Belovezhskaya Pushcha cooks use a signature ingredient to prepare them. The forest air makes the pancakes fluffier and tastier. The treats are served with various fillings.
“It's our first time here for Maslenitsa, and actually, we had never been to Belovezhskaya Pushcha during winter before. The impressions are very good: the holiday and the weather are wonderful, and the pancakes are delicious,” said Tatiana and Renat, a couple from the town of Vysokoye. Throughout the week, they happily indulged in pancakes. “Wherever you go for Maslenitsa, you're greeted with pancakes everywhere. We're teaching our children about our traditions,” the young couple said.Maslenitsa is celebrated in different corners of Brest Oblast, each with its own unique flavor. Danuta and Elena from Bereza, after studying the options, decided to go to Belovezhskaya Pushcha. “We had long wanted to come here for Maslenitsa. Our expectations and reality matched. We are waiting for spring, warmth, and flowers. Today we are seeing off winter. We are having a lot of fun; the atmosphere here is great. We tried the pancakes (made with kefir and cranberries), and we liked them,” the girls said.
Many people came to the festival in large groups. Among them was a family from Drogichin - Aleksandr, his wife, and their four sons. “We love riding bicycles in Belovezhskaya Pushcha, but we had never been here in winter. We came specially for the little one to meet Grandfather Frost. The mood is good, the atmosphere is fantastic. We love Maslenitsa for a pancake feast, for the fact that spring and warmth are coming soon. These are our traditions; we love and respect them. We are instilling this attitude in our children. The school and kindergartens also do a lot in this regard,” said the head of the large family.
In Belovezhskaya Pushcha, Maslenitsa was combined with a ceremony to bid farewell to Snegurochka [Snow Maiden]. The granddaughter of Grandfather Frost, together with Mother Winter and her daughters Blizzard, Cold, and Snowstorm, departed for the South Pole. “In winter, I help Grandfather Frost. I pay more attention to the little children. Soon the warm weather will come; such weather is difficult for me, so I am leaving for the South Pole with Mother Winter and the whole family. Of course, parting is always hard, but time will fly by quickly, and we will meet again next December," Snegurochka said.

KAMENETS DISTRICT, 21 February (BelTA) - Tourists from almost all continents have visited the residence of the Belarusian Grandfather Frost in the Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park, the host of the fairytale residence told the media, BelTA has learned.
“The winter season has been vibrant. We had a lot of visitors. Usually, there are far more organized groups than individual visitors. This year, it's the other way around. Snow maiden and I were surprised when around 200 people would show up at once. I am glad that I am not forgotten and that people come to visit me. I will happily work all year round and wait for guests,” Father Frost assured. During the high winter season, the estate would receive up to 5,000 visitors. Grandfather Frost tried to give at least a little attention to every guest, taking photos, chatting, and shaking hands. “Besides Belarusians and Russians, we have foreign guests. They come from Kazakhstan and China. Europeans have started visiting more often – from Austria, Germany, and France. We had tourists from more distant lands – from Africa (from Kenya, Uganda), from India, Pakistan, the USA, New Zealand, and Australia," the master of the residence noted.
Grandfather Frost knows how to find a way and connect with different people. “For example, guests from China love to take more photos. I've learned a few phrases in foreign languages. To make tourists feel welcome, I always say something to them in their language during our interactions,” he noted. The Grandfather Frost said that most of his correspondence comes from Belarusians. But he also has letters from foreigners, for example from China and Germany.
Marek Czulen from Slovakia had long wanted to meet the Belarusian Grandfather Frost from Belovezhskaya Pushcha. Finally, his dream came true. “This is our fourth time in Belarus. I learned about Grandfather Frost from the internet. Last year, we were here in March, but we weren’t able to see him then. We decided to come another time to meet him. It’s very beautiful here, words cannot describe it. I feel like I'm in a fairy tale," Marek shared his impressions after talking with Grandfather Frost. According to the Slovak, he is enjoying his time in Belarus. “The people in Belarus are very hospitable. I find it interesting here. Last year, we were here in May for the 80th anniversary of the Victory celebrations. It was very beautiful. I think we will definitely come again in the summer,” the man added.

Five key takeaways from the Supreme Court's landmark decision against Trump's tariffs

The Supreme Court's decision Friday to throw out a large number of tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports was widely expected. What's far less certain is the longer-run impacts as the economy and markets again adjust to a changed landscape.
Trump and other White House officials have promised to employ other authorities to implement the tariffs, with the president already announcing a 10% levy under a section of the Trade Act of 1974.
However, other questions remain: What will be the impact on prices? Will companies that paid the tariffs covered in the high court's decision seek refunds? How will the Federal Reserve react?
Here are five takeaways from the ruling and the associated fallout.
1. The economic impact
In a word, the macro reverberations are expected to be limited, especially pending Trump's next moves and what happens with the refunds issue.
RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas characterized the likely economic fallout as "narrow," though there are "enormous potential winners from this ruling," particularly in the tariff-sensitive retail and manufacturing sectors.
Growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, with GDP accelerating at just a 1.4% annualized rate. But that was largely due to the government shutdown, with faster growth likely in the first quarter of 2026.
"Fiscal conditions already point to a sizable positive impulse in 2026, driven by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an easing monetary policy backdrop," said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. "The tariff ruling may incrementally enhance this stimulus, reinforcing expectations for above-trend economic growth."
Pride warned that there could be a temporary drag on exports if companies rush to import products ahead of Trump's next tariff moves, as they did in early 2025.
2. Some help for inflation
The court decision came the same day that the Commerce Department reported core inflation ran at a 3% annual rate in December, according to the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. Central bank officials have estimated that tariffs are worth about half a percentage point to inflation, an impact that will be only temporary at least as it figures into the way inflation is calculated.
So losing the tariffs reduces, for now, a potential economic headwind that could figure into the Fed's decisions on interest rates this year.
Interestingly, markets on Friday rolled back their bets on rate cuts a bit, now placing a higher likelihood of the next reduction coming in July rather than June, as previously indicated, according to CME Group data. Traders still largely expect two cuts this year, with about 40% odds of a third — little changed from before the decision.
"We think that the Supreme Court's decision to strike down IEEPA tariffs will not have major macro implications for the U.S. economy or the Fed," Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.
3. Relief for the market
For much of the past year, Trump's more severe tariff declarations have periodically sent financial markets reeling — then spinning back higher after he ultimately backed off many of the most aggressive measures.
True to form, stocks rallied Friday, glossing over worries about the pace of growth and inflation, and raising hopes for corporate earnings. Treasury yields drifted higher but the move was contained as investors debated the merits of growth versus inflation.
"More broadly, the decision underscores a shift toward slower, more procedurally constrained trade policy, reducing headline volatility, but increasing the importance of fiscal mechanics and supply considerations for fixed‑income markets," said Dan Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.
4. What about those refunds?
Wall Street reaction was mixed on the prospect for tariff refunds.
Morgan Stanley estimated that the U.S. probably would pay back about $85 billion to affected parties. RSM's Brusuelas pegged the number at between $100 billion and $130 billion, while analyst Ed Mills at Raymond James put the outlay still higher, at about $175 billion, in line with a University of Pennsylvania model.
One question is process. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the issue specifically, likely leaving it to lower jurisdictions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the likelihood of a "mess" sorting out the issue. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, speculated that refunds won't happen retroactively at all after the issue makes its way through lower courts.
"We remain skeptical that the government will refund/pay a large sum, but, again, this issue remains unresolved," Gardner said in a note.
5. What now?
The path from here will be complicated, but Trump in a news conference Friday indicated no willingness to back down in the effort to impose tariffs, which he has repeatedly called "the most beautiful word" in the dictionary.
One important point is that it's not as if tariffs are going away.
Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover about 60% of the tariffs he has implemented, so the rest stand. From there, the administration can cite a number of provisions in the trade law to levy the duties.
However, he will need to go to Congress for approval on many of them, and there are also time limits attached to some of those measures.
"Given Trump's public ire against previous court rulings and tariff criticisms, we would not be surprised to see a meaningful tariff escalation/response from the White House sooner rather than later," wrote Chris Krueger, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Krueger expects the 2026 tariff effort to be "all gas, some [temporary[ brakes ... stay tuned."

US court okays Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments to appear in classrooms
US state’s Republican governor hails ‘comeback’ of ‘common sense’ after appeals court lifts earlier block on bill, rejecting plaintiffs’ concerns about government-endorsed religion
AP — A US appeals court has cleared the way for a Louisiana law requiring poster-sized displays of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms to take effect.
The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-6 to lift a block that a lower court first placed on the law in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law.
That’s partly because it’s not yet clear how prominently schools may display the religious text, if teachers will refer to the Ten Commandments during classes or if other texts like the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence will also be displayed, the majority opinion said.
Without those sorts of details, the panel decided it did not have enough information to weigh any First Amendment issues that might arise from the law. In other words, there aren’t enough facts available to “permit judicial judgment rather than speculation,” the majority wrote in the opinion.
In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge James Ho, an appointee of Republican US President Donald Trump, wrote that the law “is not just constitutional — it affirms our nation’s highest and most noble traditions.”
The six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, with some arguing that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place where they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.
Circuit Judge James L. Dennis, an appointee of Democratic US president Bill Clinton, wrote that the law “is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.”
The ruling is the result of the court’s choice to rehear the case with all judges present after three of them ruled in June that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional.
The reversal comes from one of the nation’s most conservative appeals courts, and one that’s known for propelling Republican policies to a similarly conservative US Supreme Court.
Republican Governor Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling Friday, declaring, “Common sense is making a comeback!”
The ACLU of Louisiana, one of several groups representing plaintiffs, pledged to explore all legal pathways to continue fighting the law.
Arkansas has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court. And a Texas law took effect on September 1, marking the widest-reaching attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.
Some Texas school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases challenging the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.
The laws are among pushes by Republicans, including Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state, while backers say the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of US law.
Joseph Davis, an attorney representing Louisiana in the case, applauded the court for upholding America’s “time-honored tradition of recognizing faith in the public square.”
Families from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, have challenged the laws, as have clergy members and nonreligious families.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation, another group involved in the challenge, called the ruling “extremely disappointing” and said the law will force families “into a game of constitutional whack-a-mole” where they will have to separately challenge each school district’s displays.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after the ruling that she had sent schools several correct examples of the required poster.
In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the US Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

The car went underwater after hitting a patch of thin ice. Seven Chinese tourists, including a couple with a 14-year-old boy, have died.
8 people died on Lake Baikal after a car with Chinese tourists fell through the ice near Olkhon Island.
According to local media, the UAZ car was travelling on ice outside an official ice crossing. In the area of movement there was a crack and an area with thin ice, as a result of which the car fell through and went under water to a depth of about 18 metres.
Only one tourist managed to get out, he has already given evidence to investigators. The driver and seven tourists died, including a couple with a 14-year-old child.
Divers are working at the scene of the tragedy. It is reported that the bodies of all victims have been localised.
A criminal case has been opened over the incident under the article on the provision of services that do not meet safety requirements and caused the death of people.
In winter Baikal becomes a popular tourist destination: excursions and car routes are organised on the ice. However, ice thickness can change dramatically due to wind, currents and temperature differences, as well as due to increasingly warm winters.

‘Burn Morana effigy, honor ancestors.’ Folklorist talks about key traditions of Maslenitsa

Golden pancakes, lively festivities, and the anticipation of spring - Maslenitsa week has traditionally become a vibrant and “delicious” period in the Belarusian calendar. But beneath the merriment lies a deep layer of folk wisdom and ancient rituals. In an interview with BelTA, Professor Irina Kazakova, Doctor of Philology and Professor in the Department of Theoretical and Belarusian Literary Studies at the Philological Faculty of Belarusian State University, discussed the reasons why sadness is off-limits during Maslenitsa, what kind of pancakes were traditionally made in Belarus, and what the burning of the effigy really represents.
Maslenitsa is a very ancient holiday. How has its perception changed with the transition to the church calendar?
Long ago, our ancestors marked the New Year in spring, when the earth stirred from its winter sleep and was reborn. This holiday marked the beginning of the spring agricultural calendar. However, with the arrival of Christianity, Great Lent caused it to be moved slightly toward the winter festive period. Still, many folklorists classify it as part of the spring celebration period. Maslenitsa is tied to the date of Easter, one of the main Christian holidays, while simultaneously maintaining a strong connection to folk rites and traditions. This is indeed what makes the holiday unique.
The celebration lasts an entire week, known as Cheese-Fare Week. During this week, meat was not to be eaten, but dairy products were still permitted. This marked the beginning of the gradual preparation for Great Lent. Why is the holiday so lengthy? Because the moment of nature’s transition from winter to spring renewal does not happen instantly. Our ancestors considered it necessary to perform rituals associated with preparing for the rebirth of the sun. They perceived time cyclically and feared that if all the rituals were not performed correctly, the sun would not be reborn, and the life cycle could be interrupted. Certain elements connected with celebrating the New Year in spring have been preserved in Maslenitsa rituals, such as grand feasts, going from house to house and yard to yard, and commemorating ancestors.
The church also commemorates the departed. On the eve of Cheese-Fare Week, Parental Saturday is observed, and memorial services for ancestors are held in churches. This is a very significant moment, placing many sacred touchpoints in people’s consciousness. It existed since ancient pagan times and carried over into the Christian framework of the holiday.
How did Maslenitsa celebrations vary between wealthy and poor families?
Everyone celebrated Maslenitsa. The only difference was in the richness of the table. More affluent families laid out large spreads. It was believed that if you were generous and kind, the year would go well. Of course, the main dish was pancakes. In Slavic tradition, these are not only a symbol of the sun and spring warmth, but also an important element of funerary rites, symbolizing the connection with ancestors. In Russia, they were made fluffy and served with caviar and fish, while in poorer families, they were served with poppy seeds. Belarusian pancakes, unlike Russian ones, were thinner and lighter. They were served with cottage cheese, butter, sour cream, jam, and berries. Poorer peasant families baked pancakes from rye and buckwheat flour. Ukrainian cuisine featured dumplings filled with cottage cheese, baked casseroles, cottage cheese pancakes, and small savory buns.
How did the tradition of Forgiveness Sunday come to be? Why does the holiday culminate in it?
Forgiveness Sunday is a very ancient tradition that dates back to early Christian times in Egypt. There, monks would go into the desert for 40 days before the start of Great Lent and, knowing that not all of them might return, they would ask each other for forgiveness. Later, this tradition evolved into a church ritual necessary to enter Great Lent with a clear conscience, to forgive others, and to receive God's forgiveness.
What are the specific features of Belarusian Maslenitsa? What unique rituals distinguish it from Russian or Ukrainian Maslenitsas?
Some regional peculiarities have been preserved in the borderlands of Belarus and Russia. For instance, in Russia there was a clearer division of activities by day. For example, on Monday, it was necessary to invite matchmakers and relatives over, and a married woman was to visit her family. Tuesday was for bride viewings, as parents wanted to arrange marriages for the young people before the start of Great Lent. On Wednesday, people went to their mothers-in-law for pancakes; on Thursday, the festivities began; and on Friday, the mother-in-law would pay a return visit. Belarusians, for the most part, would go to their mother-in-law for pancakes on the last day of the celebration. Additionally, Maslenitsa is divided into Narrow Maslenitsa (until Thursday) and Wide Maslenitsa. From Monday to Wednesday, one could do certain housework: cleaning, tidying up, but from Thursday onwards, it was time for nothing but fun: setting the tables, baking pancakes, and inviting friends over.
A unique ritual called “The Funeral of the Old Man”, which has been included in the list of the intangible cultural heritage of Belarus, has been preserved in Vitebsk Oblast. It is a simulated funeral, but it carries a deep meaning. The fact is that in the consciousness of ancient people - in mythological thinking - nothing exists on its own; everything is interconnected. The energy of nature's rebirth awakens love and passion in people themselves. Therefore, Belarusian Maslenitsa songs contain quite a few erotic elements. They are connected to the rebirth of life, the future harvest, the creation of families, and the continuation of the lineage.
For the “Funeral of the Old Man” ritual, an effigy wearing a shirt, made of straw and rags, with a mustache and curly hair, was placed in a coffin. Then, women would lament over it, saying that he had been a very good man, but loved to party and frequently changed women. After lamenting the man, the coffin was carried out of the village and buried in the snow. In some places, it was burned and the ashes were scattered over the fields to ensure a good harvest.
The "Kolodka" (wooden block) ritual is known to both Russians and Ukrainians, but it always had a unique execution among Belarusians. A wooden block would be tied to the legs of young men who were delaying marriage, as a form of punishment for not starting a family in due time. If a young man did not want to drag this block around, he could buy his way out with money, sweets, or treats. Sometimes, a similar block would be used to prop open the door of a house where there was an adult daughter who was not yet married. It was considered a bad omen if they passed by her house. In Ukraine, there was a whole Kolodiy, or "Women's Holiday." Also, during Maslenitsa, it was necessary to visit the local midwife who had delivered the babies. Usually, there was one for the entire village or for several villages. Grandchildren would also visit their grandmothers, give them sleigh rides, and the grandmothers would treat them to sweets.
During these days, they would break in young horses and bulls. It was believed that if the animal was cheerful and joyful afterward, it was worth keeping on the farm, but if it was gloomy and tired, it would be better to sell it. People were also not allowed to be sad, as despondency could bring trouble. There were other beliefs as well: many icicles during Maslenitsa days meant a good harvest, and snow on the first day of Maslenitsa meant a prosperous year.
The burning of the Maslenitsa effigy of Morana, the goddess of death, was very important. This is not simply a farewell to winter, but a sacrifice for future fertility. People often brought broken, old, or unnecessary items to the bonfire, such as a scrap of clothing from a sick person. By burning the effigy, one could burn away all troubles, problems, and illnesses, with hope for a new, bright, and good life.

Hezbollah says Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon on Friday have killed eight of its members

Two Hezbollah have confirmed to the Associated Press that eight of their members, including local-level officials, were killed in Friday’s Israeli attacks on the eastern Baalbek region. The IDF says the strikes eliminated members planning operations against Israel.
Hezbollah says Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon late on Friday have killed eight of their members, including several local officials. The strikes targeted an area near the village of Rayak in the northeast of the country.
The attack, which targeted a residential building, destroyed the top floor of a three-storey complex.
A Hezbollah official, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said that three of the dead were local commanders and identified them as Ali al-Moussawi, Mohammed al-Moussawi and Hussein Yaghi.
Israel also confirmed on Saturday that its attacks have “eliminated” Hezbollah members, in an attack which it said targeted “command centres” in the Baalbek area.
In a post on X, the Israeli Defence Forces said the targeted members were “operating to accelerate readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks toward Israel and advancing terror attack”.
“Their actions constituting a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon,” continued the IDF.
Yaghi was the son of prominent Hezbollah official and one of its founders, Mohammed Yaghi, who died in 2023. Mohammed Yaghi was also a close aide to the late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September 2024.
Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Saturday that Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon killed 10 people, including three children, and wounded two dozen others.
A doctor at the nearby Rayak Hospital corroborated the official account, saying they had received the bodies of 10 people and were treating 21 people who had sustained injuries.
The doctor said that two of those killed in the strikes – which he says took place shortly after sunset on Friday – were non-Lebanese; a Syrian man and an Ethiopian woman.
He also added that eight of those wounded were also foreign nationals, including five Syrians and three Ethiopians.
The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of intensified tensions in the region as the United States has threatened to strike Iran — a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas — if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program fail to produce a deal.
Israeli strikes on Lebanon have occurred almost daily despite a ceasefire being in effect since November 2024.
The deal, brokered by former US President Joe Biden, aimed to establish a truce after more than a year of hostilities and cross-border exchanges between Hezbollah and Israel.
Hezbollah started the attacks after Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following a Hamas-led operation in southern Israel on 7 October, 2023. Israel responded with regular strikes and shelling.
Tensions escalated from a low-scale conflict to a full-scale war in September 2024. The existing truce reduced the attacks, but hasn’t fully stopped them.
Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and says its attacks are aimed at preventing the group’s rearmament, and exclusively target their members and infrastructure. The Lebanese government says dozens of civilians have been killed in strikes since the ceasefire.

Parliamentary election campaings begin in Hungary

Candidates and their supporting organisations have two weeks to collect the necessary signatures of support.
The campaign period for the April parliamentary elections in Hungary began this weekend. Posters can now be put up, campaigning is free and candidates are now collecting their recommendation forms from local election offices.
Individual candidates must collect at least 500 valid signatures to be on the ballot paper. They must be registered by 6 March at the latest, and the nomination forms must also be delivered to the electoral offices by that date. This gives candidates and their supporting parties two weeks to collect signatures.
Voters who wish to vote for a national list on 12 April can also submit their nominations as of now. Political formations and national minority self-governments have had the opportunity to register their candidacy and register as nominating organisations with the National Election Committee since 3 February.
According to the Electoral Procedures Act, campaigning is any activity that is likely to influence or attempt to influence the will of the electorate. This could be posters, direct canvassing of voters, political advertising and political canvassing, and electoral meetings.
However, the activities of electoral bodies, personal communication between citizens as individuals, and the activities of the Constitutional Court, local governments and other state bodies in the course of their statutory duties are not considered electoral campaigns.
A fierce campaign is expected
Opinion polls show that we are facing the closest election in the last 20 years, and therefore probably the most intense campaign period. Firms close to the government regularly measure Fidesz's lead, with the Nézőpont Institute, for example, reporting a week ago that the governing party would get 46% and Tisza 40% if the elections were held now.
Independent pollsters, on the other hand, have a stable lead for Tisza. According to a survey conducted by the 21 Research Centre two weeks ago, Tisza leads Fidesz by 7 percentage points among the total population, 10 percentage points among those who can vote for a party and 16 percentage points among those who are sure voters. The Our Country, the Democratic Coalition and possibly the Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party still have a chance of entering parliament.
Very difficult to predict the outcome
The results of the opinion polls should be watched with caution for the time being, not only because there is obviously a huge variance and electoral preferences could change a lot in the remaining 50 days, but because it also important to see how the parties' popularity will be converted into votes on 12 April (i.e. which party can mobilise its voters) and how the votes will translate into parliamentary seats.
The latter will be decided by the Hungarian electoral system. Under the current system, experts say that the favourable constituency design gives Fidesz 2-3% of the list result, so even in the most extreme case, Tisza Party may get more votes but Fidesz may win more parliamentary seats and form a government. In addition, the polls do not include votes from beyond the borders, which will almost certainly improve the result of the current governing party.
Both Viktor Orbán and Péter Magyar touring the country
Election campaigning by the major parties has already started well ahead of the 50-day campaign period. Fidesz candidates and popular politicians are appearing at events, János Lázár is holding more and more Lázár info sessions, and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is taking to the stage at a weekend rally and appearing at unannounced venues during the week, usually in front of a limited audience and behind closed doors. The rallies are organised by the Digital Citizens' Circles, a Fidesz initiative, and are called anti-war rallies. This weekend the prime minister is appearing in Békéscsaba.
The pre-election rush is also underway at Tisza. On Monday, Péter Magyar embarked on a 55-day "It's now or never" tour of the country, with the Tisza Party president holding speeches at pre-announced, open-to-the-public venues across the country in the coming weeks. On Friday, it was also revealed that he will be the Tisza Party's list leader and candidate for prime minister, having been unanimously nominated by the party's leadership and 106 candidates for the post. The Tisza Party will hold a campaign launch event in Budapest on Saturday, followed by the continuation of Péter Magyar's campaign in Kaszaper, Mako and Szeged on Monday.
A lot of misleading information on the internet
The prominent role of artificial intelligence-generated content is perhaps the biggest novelty of this year's campaign compared to previous ones. In recent months, a number of AI videos have appeared on pro-government social media sites and in online advertisements. The main character of the videos is usually Péter Magyar, and the plot is that the opposition politician is proving one of the claims made about him by government officials. Many of the posters on the streets are also based on a similar method.
The computer-generated videos sometimes appear on the prime minister's Facebook page and on official Fidesz platforms. A few days ago, for example, a video (source in Hungarian), posted on the Fidesz Facebook page, of a Hungarian girl crying for her father, who is shot in the head, caused a huge stir. The message of the video, which now has more than half a million views, is that anyone who doesn't vote for Fidesz is risking war.
Similar content is not only used by the government side. A few days ago, an AI campaign (source in Hungarian) was launched on the Facebook page of Ellenszél, a media outlet close to the Democratic Coalition, in support of one of DK's main promises (to disenfranchise Hungarians living outside the country). The videos, which have hundreds of thousands of views, show a Hungarian from outside the country declaring that he will vote for Fidesz and that he doesn't care what happens in Hungary because he doesn't live there - and then laughing.
The campaign, which Political Capital has highlighted (source in Hungarian), has sparked a furore online, with hundreds of thousands of views of each video and hateful comments suggesting that many people believed they were watching real people. Furthermore, when viewed on a computer, there is no warning that the video is artificially produced, and even on a smartphone there is only a small caption warning that it is. We expect to see a lot more of this fake content on the internet during the campaign.

BERESTOVITSA DISTRICT, 21 February (BelTA) - Residents of Berestovitsa District immersed themselves in an atmosphere of fun and folk traditions at the Maslenitsa annual district festival, BelTA has learned.
There was no shortage of those willing to compete for prizes in the Maslenitsa contests: for the strongest man in Berestovitsa, the fastest pancake eater, the best in pillow fighting, the pancake relay race, and more. The residents of the district center cheered loudly and joyfully. Musicians and folk artists invited the townspeople to sing their favorite songs together.
The district competition "aLADny fest" (Pancake Fest) was also held during the festival. Local women raced against time to bake pancakes, each using their own tried-and-true recipe. The cooking, by the way, was done over a Swedish fire torch (a type of outdoor stove). As one of the competition participants, Anita Protasevich from the village of Massolyany, whose team baked 32 pancakes, said, teamwork is important in the process. “We have a lot of experience; I have been taking part in the competition for three years now, so we've gotten the hang of it. The most important thing is teamwork, so that everyone helps each other. You need a good candle [stove] and a solid frying pan. In the end, the pancakes turn out delicious. I make them, by the way, with boiling water," she said.
“Maslenitsa in Berestovitsa Style| began with a festive procession and a merry round dance, which set the tone for the festivities on Town Hall Square in the district center.
For all the guests of the holiday, of whom there were many, the organizers prepared an interactive theatrical program called “Rejoice, O People - Maslenitsa is Coming!”.

Throughout the entire festival, hostesses from across the district prepared pancakes and treated the guests. As Veronika Sitko, whose job is to cook for the machine operators of the agricultural cooperative Parkhimovtsy said that today she was happy to make pancakes using her grandmother's recipe. “It's a recipe tested over the years: a kilogram of flour, a liter of milk, 200 grams of semolina, sugar, salt, and 100 grams of yeast. Pancakes turn out delicious. In total, we baked 700 of them for the holiday,” she said. “We also love baking pancakes at home. When the children come to visit, I always make some, and we treat ourselves to them as well. We use various fillings, but our favorite is mushrooms, onions, carrots, and boiled egg. We wrap it all in thin pancakes. It's always delicious. For my grandchildren, I make pancakes with cocoa and sweet fillings.”
Nadezhda Dovgun and Yulia Sidorovich came to see Maslenitsa in Berestovitsa for the first time. The girls noted that the atmosphere at the festival was warm, good-natured, and cheerful. |Contests, games, treats – everything your heart desires. It's a wonderful holiday that concludes Maslenitsa week. These days we've been happily eating pancakes, and you can eat them in many different ways - with sour cream, with jam, or even with caviar,” the girls said.
By the way, at the festival they also tried to determine the winner of the Maslenitsa Pole competition, a favorite among Berestovitsa residents. The organizers were generous with prizes, and each participant received a gift.
The holiday traditionally culminated with the burning of the effigy, marking the end of winter and the welcome of spring.

The Yalta Conference was the second personal meeting of the leaders of the anti-Hitler coalition. The heads of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the UK - Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill - gathered at Livadia Palace to decide what the post-war world order would look like. The significance of the Yalta Conference, even decades later, can hardly be overestimated. Many politicians and experts increasingly speak of the world needing a “new Yalta”.
Why did Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill meet specifically in Yalta? What preceded this conference? How was the security of the three heads of state ensured? What was the main outcome of the Yalta Conference? These and many other issues are addressed by Andrei Kimbar, a senior lecturer at the Department of Modern and Contemporary History of Belarus, Faculty of History, Belarusian State University in the latest episode of the V Teme. Istoria [On Point. History] project. What preceded the Yalta Conference
“The discussions were intense. Stalin held the trump cards - the Red Army's rapid advance and its approach to Berlin. So he insisted that the conference be held on the territory of the Soviet Union. There were various options, but in the end, they agreed on Yalta,” Andrei Kimbar noted.
Another reason for holding the meeting on USSR territory was the Soviet side’s desire to show its allies the scale of the terrible destruction the country had suffered during the war. It is known that the American leader, Franklin Roosevelt, was indeed shocked by what he saw along the way to Livadia Palace, the venue of the Yalta Conference.
Who walked away with more?
It is impossible to know for sure whether one side secured more concessions than the other. Nevertheless, Joseph Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt succeeded in defending their fundamental positions. Winston Churchill’s proposals at the Yalta Conference were also approved, but with somewhat greater concessions. This is understandable given the closer relationship between the leaders of the USSR and the United States. Winston Churchill, for his part, held a pronounced anti-communist stance and considered this alliance a forced move in the fight against an even greater evil – Nazi Germany.
“Publications note that Roosevelt, who held seniority at the meetings, was quite measured in his actions, statements, and proposals. He discussed the future structure of the world and the United Nations,” the historian noted. “Stalin raised questions about the post-war order in Europe and Germany. Using his authority and that of the Red Army, he achieved concessions that were important to the Soviet side.”
What were the key results of the Yalta Conference?
According to the historian, the main result of Yalta was the creation of the United Nations Organization, which became a platform for dialogue between different countries. An attempt to create a similar association was made in the interwar period, leading to the emergence of the League of Nations. However, that organization failed to accomplish the tasks set before it.
“The United Nations Organization made it possible to create a serious dialogue platform. In addition, the UN Security Council emerged, which included five major countries. At that time, this mechanism looked quite effective,” believes Andrei Kimbar. “It is clear that even in the post-war period, the UN could not always prevent conflicts. But this organization managed to establish diplomacy between the blocs.”
Another important decision made in Yalta was the formation of the map of post-war Europe, liberated from Nazism. It was initially assumed that the governments of European states would receive support from the participants of the Anti-Hitler Coalition - the USSR, the USA, and Great Britain. But just a few years later, the Cold War began, and this plan was not implemented. As a result, Europe was effectively divided into the Western and Eastern blocs.
“The task of creating these blocs did not exist at the time of the Yalta Conference. Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill were still allies then, and there was no Cold War. But literally a year later, Churchill delivered the Fulton speech, after which relations between the states became strained,” the historian emphasized.
The post-war order of Germany was also discussed at the Yalta Conference. Joseph Stalin insisted on its demilitarization, but in no way wished to divide the country into many small parts. As a result, it was decided to divide Germany into occupation zones between the USSR, the USA, Great Britain, and France.
There was also discussion regarding the state of Poland. This issue was particularly important for Great Britain, which hoped to contain the ambitions of the Soviet Union through Poland. In the end, the parties agreed to move Poland’s eastern border to the so-called Curzon Line, a proposal that had already been considered back in the 1920s. This solidified the inclusion of the lands of Western Belarus into the BSSR, and Belarus became a unified state. Nevertheless, the question of Bialystok was resolved in Poland’s favor. Additionally, Polish territory was expanded at the expense of German lands.
According to the historian, the Yalta Conference adequately addressed the demands of its time. However, the death of Franklin Roosevelt, as well as the shift in the political course of the USA and Great Britain, led to further disunity within the allied camp.
Is a “new Yalta” possible? The historian makes a prediction
“It must be said that Yalta did not fully shape the image of the world. This process was completed at the Potsdam Conference. But currently, we are once again returning to the question of a multipolar world order. New poles are forming, while the old ones are trying to maintain their positions,” Andrei Kimbar said. “Europe itself is trying to return to the state before the First World War, when Britain, France, and Germany were serious poles of the world.”
The historian also drew attention to Russia and China, which also lay claim to being centers of power. The formation of new poles is leading to attempts by major powers to come to agreements among themselves. However, a meeting analogous to the Yalta Conference has not yet taken place. Nevertheless, the historian does not rule out the scenario of a kind of “new Yalta”.
“Perhaps, initially we will observe a rapprochement between relatively close political and economic blocs. Subsequently, a meeting between representatives of entire centers of attraction may take place. I mean unified global centers,” said Andrei Kimbar. “In my opinion, the most important lesson of the Yalta Conference is that it is possible to negotiate and find compromises. To achieve peace and end the bloodshed, the leaders of the coalition countries arrived at decisions that satisfied all parties and were able to implement them in the future.”

The first meeting of the leaders of the anti-Hitler coalition - the USSR, the USA, and the UK - took place in Tehran in 1943. The leaders discussed the course of the war and the opening of a second front. It is noteworthy that in the interwar period, the Soviet Union, the United States of America, and the UK were essentially in opposing camps. The Tehran Conference showed the whole world that the anti-Hitler coalition was functioning and that the leaders of the three countries could hold personal meetings and jointly resolve critical issues.
“The agreements of the Tehran Conference were instrumental in shifting the strategic balance of World War II. By the Yalta Conference, a rapid offensive was underway. The Soviet army was advancing at a significant pace, about 3 km per day,” Andrei Kimbar said. “It became clear to the leaders of the countries that they needed to meet again and decide what to do next, how to coordinate their actions in the final stage of the war.”
It was during this period that the leaders of the Soviet Union, the UK, and the United States began discussing the possibility of another meeting. The first proposals for a new conference were voiced in the summer of 1944. The key issues to be resolved by the leaders of the anti-Hitler coalition were the redivision of spheres of influence and the future of Europe liberated from Nazi Germany.
Why did Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill hold their meeting in Yalta?
Many options were proposed for holding the new meeting between Joseph Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill. Locations such as Athens, Rome, Malta, and Alexandria were considered. According to the historian, Franklin Roosevelt suggested, among other places, meeting in Scotland.
Another reason for holding the meeting on USSR territory was the Soviet side’s desire to show its allies the scale of the terrible destruction the country had suffered during the war. It is known that the American leader, Franklin Roosevelt, was indeed shocked by what he saw along the way to Livadia Palace, the venue of the Yalta Conference.
Where did the participants of the Yalta Conference stay?
Representatives of the Soviet, American, and British delegations were housed in three palaces. The Soviet delegation, led by Joseph Stalin, chose Yusupov Palace in Koreiz. The temporary residence for the British side, headed by Winston Churchill, was Vorontsov Palace in Alupka. The U.S. representatives, led by Franklin Roosevelt, stayed in Livadia Palace, which also served as the venue for the official meetings.
“Roosevelt settled in Livadia Palace, in part, for health reasons, as many publicists claim,” the historian added. “The American leader was paralyzed, so he settled there to avoid traveling long distances.”
Vorontsov Palace, where the British leader stayed, was located some distance from Livadia Palace. The intention was to limit direct contact between Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. “The documents that enable us to follow the conference’s proceedings attest to the effectiveness of this decision,” said Andrei Kimbar.
How the security of the country leaders was ensured in Yalta
The Nazi high command directed the Abwehr to organize a plot to assassinate the leaders of the anti-Hitler coalition during their meeting in Tehran. The operation, dubbed “Operation Long Jump,” was never carried out; Soviet intelligence managed to uncover and prevent the assassination attempt. There is no documented evidence that Germany harbored similar plans for Yalta, despite the tense situation. This placed certain demands on the security of the three countries’ leaders, which was ensured at the highest level in Yalta.
“Crimea had been relatively recently liberated from occupation, and sabotage groups and various criminal gangs were still operating on its territory. The Soviet side stepped up its efforts to combat them, and a number of operations were carried out in the area where the conference was planned,” the historian noted. “In a relatively short period of time, Soviet counterintelligence completely took control of the territory to prevent possible acts of sabotage.”
State security forces were deployed to the conference site. Anti-aircraft guns and machine guns were positioned on the ground, and fighter jets patrolled the airspace. The entire route of the delegates to the conference was guarded, including by armored vehicles. Several checkpoints were set up along the route, and suspicious individuals were detained for identification.
It is known that the German side suspected the plans to hold a conference in Yalta, so Soviet counterintelligence carried out disinformation efforts. For example, Odessa was being actively spruced up to confuse the enemy about the conference’s location.
According to the historian, the main result of Yalta was the creation of the United Nations Organization, which became a platform for dialogue between different countries. An attempt to create a similar association was made in the interwar period, leading to the emergence of the League of Nations. However, that organization failed to accomplish the tasks set before it.
“The United Nations Organization made it possible to create a serious dialogue platform. In addition, the UN Security Council emerged, which included five major countries.

Guns, fashionable clothes and death threats: How gangs in Haiti ensnare children

Guns, fashionable clothes and death threats: How gangs in Haiti ensnare children
A 16-year-old Haitian boy has been talking about how he was lured into working for a criminal gang but then threatened with death when he said he would not fight against the police.
Joseph is one of an increasing number of children who are joining gangs in Haiti, a Caribbean island nation which is experiencing overlapping security, humanitarian and governance crises.
Some 1.4 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of gang violence and thousands more have died.
More robust protection measures for children in gang-affected communities are being highlighted in a new report released by the UN in Haiti.
Read Joseph’s account of gang life:
“I grew up in a poor neighbourhood where gangs controlled everything. I saw armed men in the streets all the time. Some were well-dressed, had nice cars, and were surrounded by women. They were the ones who made the rules in our neighbourhood.
For us children, it was normal. We didn’t have many opportunities to play sports or have fun, and there really wasn’t any hope for the future.
One day, towards the end of August 2024, I was hanging out with a friend and he told me that he was part of a gang. He talked to me about all the positive things the gang gave him, like money and the feeling of being important. He told me I should join them too. I hesitated because I knew it was dangerous, but I decided to give it a try.
Attacking the police
Shortly after I joined, a gang member gave me a radio and asked me to monitor the police and inform the gang of their movements. Then the gang leader gave me a firearm.
There were rumours of a major police operation, and I was told that I would have to fight the police. I was afraid, because I did not want to be killed. I told the gang leader that I wanted to go home. He became very angry and struck me with the weapon. He hit me repeatedly until he broke my hand. He told me that if I tried to leave, he would kill me.
Even though I was very afraid to confront the police, I managed to escape shortly afterwards. Someone in my community told me about an organization that could help me get medical care and support. I contacted them in September 2024 and, since then, they have been helping me through counselling and support to cope with everything I went through.”

News of the story
"On Point"
MINSK, 20 February (BelTA) – At the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky had the role of a bit player, Russian journalist Sergey Mardan said in a recent episode of the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA’s YouTube channel.
According to the expert, the head of the Kiev regime was invited to the conference for PR purposes, and his scandalous statement directed at the Russian president sparked a wave of discussion in various circles.
“It seemed to me that in recent weeks, Zelensky has been in a state of certain confusion,” Sergey Mardan said. “He doesn’t fully understand his place in the current processes, and that’s why he’s nervous. His statement is a fairly simple PR trick: let's crank the rhetoric up to the skies, attract attention, and maybe it will help for a moment. This probably does some good, to some extent, for internal governance consolidating his core audience, supporters inside Ukraine, and so on, but it does absolutely nothing to solve the key task.”
The journalist believes that Zelensky was a background character at the Munich Conference. “This event was objectively not on his level, and no one really invited him there as a key speaker. They summoned him, he came, but Zelensky was completely absent from the agenda that was actually discussed by American and European media. Everyone was discussing Rubio's démarche when he refused to meet with European leaders and left to meet with Orbán. That’s what’s interesting. The divorce of the Euro-Atlantic alliance is interesting. But Zelensky is nothing more than a bit player,” the expert emphasized.
Sergey Mardan noted that Russian media and Foreign Ministry representatives reacted strongly to Zelensky's rhetoric. “There's no need to add excessive subjecthood to someone who has a problem with subjecthood,” the journalist believes.
