Hong Kong banks reward staff with gifts, extra holiday and lai see as they return to work
Bank of China (Hong Kong) is giving away hampers, ZA Bank is paying a HK$10,000 bonus, while HSBC and Hang Seng are offering HK$500
Thousands of Hong Kong bank employees will receive a return-to-work lai see on Friday, with some banks handing out extra benefits and gifts to their staff amid improving economic and market sentiment.
While it is a Chinese tradition for companies to give their staff lai see on the first working day of the Lunar New Year as a token of appreciation for their hard work, many banks nowadays give their staff lai see and other goodies before the holiday.
Bank of China (Hong Kong) is giving each of its 15,000 staff a HK$500 (US$64) laisee to mark the Year of the Horse, the same as in previous years. However, the bank’s gift hamper this year is bigger, with the number of items increasing to eight from six. The basket consists of mushrooms, morel mushrooms, dried scallops, fish maw, XO sauce, dried conch, pistachios and American ginseng.
HSBC and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank are also distributing HK$500 to each of their combined staff of nearly 26,000 electronically, amounting to around HK$13 million, the largest payout among Hong Kong banks.
“The Year of the Horse symbolises vitality, speed and success – qualities that perfectly reflect the energy we’re bringing into 2026,” said Maggie Ng, CEO of HSBC Hong Kong, in her new year message to staff. “I’m confident that it’s going to be another exciting year where we will harness our collective strengths to create many opportunities for our customers.”

Democrats say citizenship question could derail census test and deter immigrants from participating
Congressional Democrats are warning that the U.S. Census Bureau risks undermining an upcoming test of the 2030 census by using a form that includes a citizenship question
- Bookmark
U.S. Census Bureau plans to use a questionnaire with a citizenship question as part of its practice test for the 2030 census could jeopardize the once-a-decade head count and scare away immigrants from participating, congressional Democrats warned Thursday.
Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform urged the Census Bureau to drop plans to use the American Community Survey form, which includes the citizenship question, and instead use a traditional census questionnaire that omits it. The on-the-ground tests in Huntsville, Alabama, and Spartanburg, S.C., start next month.
“The Trump Administration is risking millions of taxpayer dollars to pursue policies which could fatally compromise the 2030 count before it even begins,” they wrote in a letter to acting Census Bureau Director George Cook and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, whose department oversees the statistical agency.
The Census Bureau and Commerce Department didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The field test gives the statistical agency the chance to learn how to better tally populations that were undercounted during the last census. The head count determines how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, as well as how $2.8 trillion in federal funding is distributed annually. Among the new methods being tested is the use of U.S. Postal Service workers to conduct tasks previously done by census workers.
In recent weeks, the Census Bureau made public plans for the 2026 test that would use the American Community Survey form, which asks a wide range of questions about participants, and eliminated four other planned locations — Colorado Springs, Colorado, western North Carolina, western Texas and tribal lands in Arizona.
The Democrats raised concerns that the citizenship question on the American Community Survey form being used would lead to an undercount by deterring immigrants, including legal residents, from participating.
“Many immigrants or citizens in mixed-status families, including green card holders and other legal permanent residents, face fear, chaos, and uncertainty over who the Trump Administration will target next for denaturalization and deportation,” they said in their letter.
In his first term, President Donald Trump unsuccessfully tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census form. The Republican president also signed orders that would have excluded people who are in the U.S. illegally from the figures used to divvy up congressional seats among the states and mandated the collection of citizenship data.
The attempt to add the citizenship question was blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court, and both orders were rescinded when Democrat Joe Biden took office in January 2021, before the 2020 census figures were released.
The Constitution’s 14th Amendment says “the whole number of persons in each state” should be counted for the numbers used for apportionment, the process of divvying up congressional seats, and Electoral College votes among the states. The Census Bureau has interpreted that to mean anybody living in the U.S., regardless of legal status.

President Donald Trump said Thursday, February 19, that Iran had at most 15 days to make a deal on concerns starting with its nuclear program, suggesting the United States would attack if it did not.
"We're either going to get a deal or it's going to be unfortunate for them," Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Asked about his timeline, Trump said, "I would think that would be enough time – 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum."
Trump earlier Thursday had suggested 10 days for Iran's clerical state to reach an agreement.
"It's proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen," Trump told the inaugural meeting of the "Board of Peace," his initiative to secure stability in Gaza.
He warned at the event in Washington that the US "may have to take it a step further" without any agreement, adding: "You're going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days."
Trump's friend and roving envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner met Tuesday indirectly in Geneva with Iran's top diplomat, who said that there was progress.
The talks come a month after Iranian authorities killed thousands of people as they crushed one of the biggest threats yet to the Islamic Republic established in the 1979 revolution that toppled the pro-Western shah.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to hold talks on February 28 in Israel with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long advocated tough action against Tehran and ordered a bombing campaign last year.

Revealed: Epstein cultivated relationship with CBP officer, causing US investigation

Federal investigators examined Jeffrey Epstein’s relationship with a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer who worked at the St Thomas airport to which Epstein regularly flew on his private planes before traveling by boat or helicopter to his private island, newly released documents reveal.
As part of that investigation, which did not result in any charges, investigators also issued subpoenas related to three additional CBP officers working at the Cyril E King Airport (STT) on St Thomas, documents show. The Guardian also identified two other CBP officers on St Thomas and in Florida who were in contact with Epstein, based on emails and text messages between Epstein, his staff and the officers. It does not appear the FBI ever investigated those two officers.
The FBI in New York opened a preliminary investigation in October 2019 after receiving a report that a long-serving CBP agricultural inspector “had ongoing friendship with Mr Epstein … while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years”. The email establishing the investigation into the agricultural inspector, Timothy “Bill” Routch, is among the millions of files related to Epstein’s crimes that were released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) this month.
Federal authorities interviewed Epstein’s longtime pilot about the convicted sex offender’s contacts with CBP agents.
US Customs and Border Protection is the federal law enforcement agency tasked with overseeing the entrance of people and goods through US ports of entry, including airports. It claims to be “uniquely situated to deter and disrupt human trafficking”, and is one of the four primary US agencies tasked with enforcing federal anti-trafficking law.
In July 2019, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Epstein on charges of sex trafficking minors as young as 14 in New York and Palm Beach, Florida. Following Epstein’s death by suicide in jail in August 2019, the attorney general of the US Virgins Islands – an unincorporated territory of the US that includes St Thomas and Epstein’s private islands, Little St James and Great St James – filed suit against his estate, alleging that Epstein “trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls” on those private islands, using “private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from and within the Virgin Islands”.
No CBP officer was ever charged for crimes related to Epstein, and the Guardian has not seen any evidence to suggest that CBP officers had direct knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. The FBI interviewed Routch and subpoenaed credit reports about him and three other CBP officers, but it is not clear whether the investigation went any further. The release of the government’s investigative files on Epstein has been delayed, redactions are inconsistent, and it is not clear how many more files will be made public.
Routch acknowledged interacting with Epstein “in the course of [his] employment”, visiting Epstein’s island, and being investigated by the FBI. He disputed many of the details contained in FBI and CBP documents. In emails with the Guardian, he characterized the FBI investigation as “a wild goose chase”, and said: “All my encounters were of a business nature … I never [witnessed] anything remotely related to trafficking.”
Epstein emailed and texted with CBP officers, invited them to his island, visited with them at the airport, and frequently sought to determine who was going to be on duty when he was traveling through STT, the released files show. Some officers received financial advice, others, small gifts, and employment opportunities. One officer was invited to perform the steel pan drums on Little St James on multiple occasions; Epstein tasked his assistant with helping another with an interest in accounting to find mentorship. That agent solicited Epstein for a “hard-money loan”, though he told the Guardian the loan never materialized.
Epstein also raised complaints about less-than-friendly treatment from other CBP officers with his friendly agents, twice eliciting promises from supervisors to look into the perceived ill treatment.
The Guardian contacted CBP and the Department of Homeland Security for comment. They did not respond by our deadline.
In March 2016, Jeffrey Epstein was burdened with logistical headaches. Eight years after pleading guilty to charges of child sexual exploitation, the billionaire continued to enjoy a jet-setting lifestyle, regularly travelling between his homes in New York, Florida, New Mexico and the US Virgin Islands on a fleet of private jets.
Travel between the mainland US and his compound on Little St James was complicated. Flights to St Thomas were treated like domestic flights, but flights departing St Thomas for a US airport had to clear customs and immigration control.
Epstein and his personal pilot, Larry Visoski, typically expedited this process by “preclearing” in St Thomas. Preclearance is a longstanding CBP program that allows travelers to go through CBP inspections at certain overseas airports rather than upon arrival. Emails between Epstein and Visoski suggest that they preferred to preclear whenever possible and that Epstein was often personally involved in those arrangements.
But on 1 March 2016, something went awry. About an hour out from Teterboro airport in New Jersey, a popular airport for private and corporate jets in close proximity to Manhattan, Visoski received a satellite call from his wife. A CBP officer had just called her as Visoski’s emergency contact and was threatening Visoski with some kind of fine. Visoski made contact with the Teterboro CBP officer, who told Visoski that he could “NOT let my passengers deplane and to bring the aircraft directly to the Customs building upon arrival”, the pilot later recalled.
Visoski informed the CBP officer by satellite phone that he had precleared customs in STT and eventually received what he described as “a sincere apology”. Epstein pursued the issue, however, seeking further information about CBP procedures at other airports and asking Visoski to get the name of the CBP officer’s supervisor.
Just two weeks later, another hiccup occurred. Upon arriving at the airport in Newark, New Jersey – and despite preclearing at STT – a CBP officer required Epstein’s passengers to pass through immigration control.
Darren Indyke, Epstein’s longtime lawyer, sent a formal complaint to the Department of Homeland Security’s private aircraft support office, noting that “in the course of N212JE’s numerous flights between St Thomas and Teterboro, and St Thomas and West Palm Beach, there has been a lack of uniformity in the clearance and pre-arrival requirements imposed by local CBP offices at each of those locations, and, at times, by different CPB officers within them”. Indyke followed up on 23 May and appears to have scheduled a conference call with staff from private aircraft support on 25 May.
But while Indyke was going through official channels, Epstein was taking a more direct approach. The billionaire emailed James Heil, a supervisory CBP officer based on St Thomas. “One off the passengers . a woman with an asylum application pending, work authorization and a social secirity card, was asked for her passport and in it given a B 2 tourist visa,” Epstein complained. (Epstein’s communications are littered with punctuation and spelling errors.) “The other passenger was stamped in as well , though they did not change her departure date.”
Heil offered to reach a supervisor “up there”, and said: “I apologize that you are experiencing these issues again.” It’s not clear what actions, if any, Heil took from there. Heil did not respond to queries from the Guardian.
Heil had been in direct communication with Epstein since at least 2014, documents show. An email from one of Epstein’s assistants suggests Heil was scheduled to visit Little St James by boat on 28 February 2014, though it’s not known whether the visit took place. Epstein regularly emailed or texted Heil about issues he had going through customs at various airports or to see if Heil was going to be on duty when he planned to depart STT.
The correspondence appears friendly. Epstein texted Heil a message of thanks on Christmas Day 2014. “It was my pleasure,” Heil responded the next day. “Feel free to utilize my not-so-insignificant IQ anytime, and also feel free to connect via social media. (We Brooklyn Boys stick together.)”
“Atta boy,” Epstein responded.
At one point during their text exchanges, Epstein, perhaps jokingly, invited Heil to “stop by at my house and I’ll make you an egg cream”. There is no evidence Heil took him up on the offer. On Christmas Eve 2016, Epstein texted Heil: “Just landed with your xmas cannolis . Where can I deliver them.” Heil was off work, so Epstein had his driver deliver the treats to Heil’s home. Twice, Epstein appears to have offered to bring Heil “something” from the mainland.
Epstein also regularly raised issues that he encountered with airport customs at STT and other US airports, and Heil said he was working to liaise with CBP officers in Florida, Massachusetts and New Jersey on Epstein’s behalf. At times, Epstein discussed with Visoski whether they should ask Heil to approve overtime – in an apparent effort to arrange for Epstein to get precleared outside of CBP’s regular hours.
In November 2016, Epstein texted Heil that one of his agents had been “nasty”. “I will speak to him!” Heil responded. “I will handle it, formally.”
Records of Epstein’s direct interactions with the six CBP officers are mingled amid the bold-faced names that have dominated coverage of Epstein’s circle of influence. A memorandum of Epstein’s May 2013 schedule, included in an email to Indyke, records appointments with Mort Zuckerman, Leon Black, Bob Kerrey, Joel Klein, Joi Ito, Woody and Soon Yi Allen, and Tom Pritzker – as well as “Customs Agent Bill Routch”.
Routch is the first CBP officer to appear in the files, chronologically. Epstein appears to have begun contacting him in late 2012 and invited him to visit Little St James “for coffee” on 21 May 2013. Routch acknowledged visiting the island but said it was to perform an agricultural inspection of some trees.
In 2014, Epstein made contact with Heil as well as another agent, Jeff McNally, whom Visoski had flagged as being “nice”. McNally was scheduled for lunch on Little St James in May 2014, according to an email from one of Epstein’s assistants, though it is not known whether he attended. McNally did not respond to queries from the Guardian.
In 2015, Epstein got the name of another agent, Glen Samuel, from Heil, and asked Samuel to perform steel pan drumming on the island. Emails from Epstein’s assistants show that Samuel was scheduled to perform on the island at least twice, and that in 2016 he proposed offering regular lessons to Epstein’s “guests”. It’s unclear if the lessons ever occurred. Samuel did not respond to queries from the Guardian.
Epstein had received assurance from Heil that Samuel was allowed to undertake outside employment, but Samuel appears to have declined payment. “Mr. Samuel says he does not intend to charge you,” one of Epstein’s assistants wrote in an email. “He considers you a friend and was doing this for you. If you wish to give him something, he is appreciative, but there is no fee.”
Heil also appears to have introduced Epstein to Gerardo (Gerry) Martinez, a CBP supervisor at the airport in Palm Beach, Florida. The files show regular communication between Epstein and Martinez throughout 2018, with Epstein often flagging his arrival at the airport and seeking to meet. Epstein also complained to Martinez after “your guys busted my balls” when he told CBP agents that he was carrying $3,000 in cash but actually had $11,800. Epstein repeatedly followed up with questions about the regulations on carrying currency between the US Virgin Islands and mainland US, with Martinez sending the question “all the way to chief counsel”.
In March 2019, Epstein appears to have asked Martinez for help or advice in obtaining a new passport, writing: “can i call you , ? not sure =hat to do, i need to get a new passport with the sex identifier on =t. is it ok to travel back and forth to the Virigi= islands without a valid passport?” Epstein made three attempts to meet with Martinez at the airport in the ensuing weeks, though it’s not clear if they met or why Epstein would turn to a CBP officer for help obtaining a passport.
Martinez acknowledged interacting with Epstein when reached by the Guardian by phone, but did not immediately respond to further queries.
Epstein was arrested at Teterboro airport on federal sex trafficking charges on 6 July 2019, after flying in from Paris.
The emails provide extensive communication between Epstein and a St Thomas CBP agent, Alford Richards, with whom Epstein arranged more than a dozen meetings between 2015 and 2019. It is not clear how many actually occurred.
The emails show that Richards and Epstein first spoke about finance in August 2015, while Richards was working at the airport. Epstein had his assistants follow up, emailing Richards a link to Khan Academy, an online education company, as well as the billionaire’s advice that Richards start with “basic finance courses first”. Richards initially communicated with Epstein’s assistants, seeking further instruction on finance and investments, but was soon emailing regularly with Epstein himself.
“I’m in action mode right now and have dedicated everyday to getting there,” he wrote to Epstein about his plans for “financial freedom” in October 2015, after a meeting at Epstein’s helicopter hangar. “I only take advice from you and every time we speak i take every thing literal and go out and do it. I know this is the COST I must endure to get where I want to get and I will ‘never’ give up.”
In an interview, Richards acknowledged his numerous interactions with Epstein, including through meetings at Epstein’s office and on his private island “a couple of times”, but sought to minimize the extent of the relationship. “It wasn’t anything in-depth,” Richards said. “It’s like, hey this guy is rich, let me hear his opinions.” Epstein was well-known on the island as a billionaire, and Richards was “just trying to get some financial insight,” he said.
By email, Epstein counseled Richards to take accounting courses and had one of his assistants try to find Richards “hand-on experience” in accounting with a company on the island, through part-time work, an internship, or some kind of mentoring. The assistant contacted multiple local companies with which Epstein did business on Richards’ behalf.
Much of the advice Epstein gave was “stuff I already found out by reading my books”, Richards said, but it “felt good that little me, who is no one” was getting financial tips from a billionaire. The internship “never came to fruition”, he said. “He’d give me like, vague tips, and then that was it,” Richards said. “I just wanted some hints and to get better at my finances.”
Early in their interactions, Epstein tasked Richards with finding out whether the fuel supplier for commercial airlines at STT would also sell to him, calling it a “good project” for Richards. Richards made inquiries and responded within a day. (Richards recalled the incident and said Epstein’s request had been “over my head” and “out of my league”.) The pair shared links to articles about investment prospects (in Belize, Bitcoin, immigration detention centers, and local real estate) and Richard’s shared a number of business proposals with Epstein. They regularly arranged to meet around Epstein’s travel schedule.
In June 2017, Epstein and Richards discussed a forthcoming auction of local real estate. Soon thereafter, Epstein emailed Richards: “as you have asked me for hard money loan , please as= your supervisor if we can continue this converation.” Richards responded on 31 July 2017: “I spoke with my supervisor & was told that conversations on such a matter is ok, however, if I was to actually procure a hard money loan from you. It could or may be interpreted in a awkward way if I had to process you for official CBP travel business and the full terms of the transaction is not known or understood by certain individuals.”
Richards said that the request for a “hard-money loan” – a type of short-term loan typically used in real estate transactions – was not serious, but the result of him trying to “naively speak the jargon of a person that knows what they’re saying but not really knowing”. No actual loan was made, he said.
Richards said he never saw any hint of Epstein’s alleged crimes, which he described as “horrible” and “disgusting”.
“I just knew he was rich, and he had some issues with the law years ago,” he said. “To be associated with him is horrible, and I’m not that type of person. I can’t believe I actually was speaking to this horrible person, but you never know people’s life.”
On 30 August 2019, Routch stepped into his supervisor’s office in North Charleston, South Carolina, where he had worked since leaving the US Virgin Islands in 2016. “He respectfully requested to speak in confidence, closed the door, and appeared to be concerned, worried, and a bit shaken, about federal investigators looking into his past,” according to a CBP memo documenting the meeting.
It was just a few weeks since Epstein’s suicide in a New York City jail cell, and Routch had learned that a woman he had previously dated had alerted the FBI that Routch was “a known associate of Jeffery Epstein, had ongoing friendship with Mr. Epstein, and that while working for CBP Pre-Clearance in Saint Thomas for over 7 years, and assisted Mr Epstein for conducting human trafficking of underage females”, the memo states.
Asked how the woman would have known about this, Routch responded: “Everyone knew I was friends with Jeffery Epstein … I have been to his house, been on his boat, and flew in helicopter for whale watching.”
The memo was forwarded to the CBP Watch Commander, and then to an investigator with DHS’s inspector general’s office. The FBI opened a preliminary investigation on the matter on 10 October 2019.
The Guardian has not seen any evidence in the files to support the complainant’s allegation that Routch had direct knowledge or involvement in Epstein’s crimes.
Routch disputes the account of the opening of the investigation provided in the CBP memo. In emails to the Guardian, he claimed that there had never been any report by a woman to the FBI, and that instead his supervisor “fabricated a story to send to the FBI to glorify himself”.
“In the course of my employment I ran into Mr Epstein several times,” he said. “All my encounters were of a business nature … I never [witnessed] anything remotely related to trafficking.
“I have done nothing wrong,” he added.
In May 2020, federal prosecutors obtained subpoenas for credit checks on Routch.
A July 2020 email memorialized notes from an initial conversation between federal prosecutors and attorneys for Visoski, who was asked about Epstein’s contact with Routch. Visoski did not recall Routch, though he acknowledged having his contact information in his phone, but he named Heil, McNally and Samuel as CBP officers with whom Epstein had some kind of relationship. “Some inspectors would delay JE for a while, whereas McNally and Heil wouldn’t give him a hard time,” the notes state.
Federal prosecutors went on to subpoena credit reports for Heil, McNally and Samuel. There is no indication in the files that they ever investigated Richards or Martinez.
The FBI and federal prosecutors interviewed Visoski about Epstein’s interactions with CBP officers in November 2020. Visoski related Epstein’s practice of making “small talk” with CBP officers during pre-clearance and said he had given “one or two helicopter rides to CBP officers to EPSTEIN’s private island”, according to an FBI memo. Visoski also disclosed that Epstein had asked him to call a CBP officer “approximately 20 times” when he was arriving at STT after the CBP office closed, to ask whether it could remain open to process their plane. The officer “denied their request 80% of the time”, Visoski said.
The memo suggests that investigators were investigating CBP’s potential awareness of Epstein’s criminal activity.
“Sometimes EPSTEIN would be traveling with a female who had a foreign passport,” it states. “EPSTEIN would argue with CBP that this did not pose a CUSTOMS issue and that it was an immigration issue only … Some passengers on EPSTEIN’s plane were college students with a letter from their college stating their purpose for travel. When questioned by CBP, EPSTEIN would intervene and argue about the fact that the plane had not left United States territory. Sometimes a CBP officer would take the passenger into another room to be interviewed … VISOSKI was not aware of any special benefits or gifts given to any CBP officers. VISOSKI had no knowledge of any CBP officer assisting EPSTEIN in trafficking underage passengers.”
Routch was interviewed by the FBI and an agent from DHS’s inspector general office on 7 April 2021. The memorandum of the interview provides insight into Epstein’s correspondence with individuals so far removed from his normal, elite circles.
Routch disputes much of what is contained in the memo, including the sequence of events that led to the investigation and the number of visits he made to Epstein’s island. He alleged that a CBP officer present during the interview “threaten[ed] me with physical violence” and that he was denied the right to have a union representative present during the interview.
Routch “thought it was a good idea to maintain contact with EPSTEIN because of his status, wealth and influence”, according to the memo. He “overly exaggerated” the relationship to others, showing people that he had Epstein’s contact in his phone, especially after his death. “It was an ego boost … because not everyone can say they know a billionaire,” according to the memo. He had not actually been whale watching on Epstein’s helicopter, though he may have lied about having done so to exaggerate the relationship, according to the memo.
According to the memo, Routch described ingratiating himself with Epstein through “mak[ing] sure he was being treated with fairness and respect by non-white US CBP personnel”, but said he never offered or received any special favors. Routch, who is white, told investigators that there was a “great deal of racial tension” in the Virgin Islands, and that “the ‘blacks’ disrespect the local white population”, prompting his concern for Epstein’s treatment. He said Epstein wanted to buy new computers for the CBP offices, as well as turkeys for CBP staff, but was told by a supervisor that they could not accept gifts.
Routch denied any knowledge or involvement with trafficking underage girls, but said he was aware of Epstein’s criminal conviction and that he assumed that “Eastern European women who took commercial flights to the USVI” were heading for Epstein’s island, according to the memo. When he visited the island for lunch in 2013, he claimed to see “three or four ‘nice’, ‘beautiful’ women swimming and having fun” but “did not notice anything unusual nor did he notice anybody who appeared to be in trouble”. “EPSTEIN always had older ladies with him, maybe in their 20s or 30s,” he said.
According to the memo, Routch visited Little St James a second time in 2014 or 2015 to inspect some trees that Epstein had imported for spider mites.
By email, Routch insisted that only one visit occurred. “We had lunch and we discussed trees he was importing,” Routch wrote. Routch suggested that the FBI may have misconstrued a single visit as two; the memo clearly refers to two visits, a few years apart.
Routch “was aware of EPSTEIN’s conviction involving the abuse of minors but supported EPSTEIN because he was a good guy”, according to the memo. He said he had also “heard” that Epstein may have been framed by a secretary.
Ultimately, he told the FBI, he “stood by EPSTEIN as he would any friend, even though he was, in reality, more of an acquaintance”.

Judge declares 4 men once wrongfully accused in brutal 1991 murders innocent
This declaration of ‘actual innocence’ could prove crucial for the men and their families should they seek financial compensation for years spent incarcerated
- Bookmark
Four men wrongfully accused of the brutal 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders have finally been declared innocent by a Texas judge, formally clearing their names over three decades after the horrific killings that haunted the city.
"You are innocent," state District Judge Dayna Blazey affirmed during a poignant hearing in a packed Austin courtroom on Thursday. Her declaration brings a measure of closure to a dark chapter for the men and their families, and for a city deeply shaken by the crime's brutality and investigators' initial inability to solve it. Judge Blazey described her order as "an obligation to the rule of law and the obligation to the dignity of the individual."
The announcement follows cold case detectives revealing last year that they had connected the killings to a suspect who died in a 1999 standoff with police in Missouri.
Two of the four original suspects, Michael Scott and Forrest Welborn, were present in court with family members to hear prosecutors acknowledge their innocence. Robert Springsteen, who was initially convicted and spent several years on death row, did not attend. Maurice Pierce died in 2010 during a confrontation with police after a traffic stop.
"Over 25 years ago, the state prosecuted four innocent men ... (for) one of the worst crimes Austin has ever seen," Travis County First Assistant District Attorney Trudy Strassburger stated at the hearing's opening. "We could not have been more wrong."
This declaration of "actual innocence" could prove crucial for the men and their families should they seek financial compensation for years spent incarcerated or living under a cloud of suspicion.
"My son's name has finally been cleared after more than 25 years of being called the monster, the murderer and everything else," said Phil Scott, Michael Scott's father. "Son, be proud."
The killings shocked Austin and confounded investigators for years. Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, ages 17 and 15, were bound, gagged and shot in the head at the "I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt" store where two of them worked. The building was subsequently set on fire.
Investigators pursued thousands of leads and several false confessions before the four men, who were teenagers at the time of the girls' deaths, were arrested in late 1999. Springsteen and Scott were convicted largely based on confessions they insisted were coerced by police. Both convictions were overturned in the mid-2000s. Welborn was charged but never tried after two grand juries refused to indict him. Pierce spent three years in jail before charges were dismissed and he was released.
Prosecutors had intended to retry Springsteen and Scott, but a judge ordered the charges dismissed in 2009 when new DNA tests, unavailable in 1991, revealed another male suspect.
"Let us not forgot that Robert Springsteen could be dead right now, executed at the hands of the state of Texas," Springsteen’s attorney Amber Farrelly said at the start of an emotional hearing where several family members spoke of lives ruined by incarceration and years of harassment by investigators.
In a statement read in court, Welborn recounted losing friends, struggling to maintain employment, and experiencing homelessness. Michael Scott testified that his arrest, conviction, and prison sentence ultimately fractured his family. "I lost my family. I lost my youth. My daughter was 3 years old when I was arrested. We had just celebrated our first wedding anniversary. I lost the chance to build a family," Scott said. "Every day I have carried the weight of a crime I did not commit."
Maurice Pierce’s daughter, Marisa Pierce, directed her comments at former police investigators and prosecutors, whom she accused of harassing her father even after his release, tormenting him until the confrontation that led to his death. "Daddy, you have your name back," she declared. "The world knows what you were trying to say all along."
After Scott and Springsteen were released, the case effectively went cold until 2025, when an HBO documentary series attracted new public attention to the unsolved crime. Investigators then made a stunning announcement last September: new DNA science and reviews of old ballistics evidence pointed to Robert Eugene Brashers as the sole killer.
Since 2018, authorities had used advanced DNA evidence to link Brashers to the strangulation death of a South Carolina woman in 1990, the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee, and the shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri in 1998. The crucial link to the Austin case emerged when a DNA sample taken from under Amy Ayers’ fingernail matched Brashers from the 1990 killing.
Austin investigators also discovered that Brashers had been arrested at a border checkpoint near El Paso two days after the yogurt shop killings. In his stolen car was a pistol matching the calibre used to kill one of the girls in Austin. Police noted similarities between the yogurt shop case and Brashers' other crimes: victims were tied up with their own clothing, sexually assaulted, and some crime scenes were set on fire.
Brashers died in 1999 when he shot himself during an hours-long standoff with police at a motel in Kennett, Missouri.

Stephen Colbert and CBS upended Jasmine Crockett’s Senate hopes in Texas. Here’s why influencer Democrats are furious
The congresswoman’s high-profile supporters are seething, writes John Bowden, as her opponent basks in the national limelight — and rakes in donations after Colbert takes their interview to YouTube

The race for a U.S. Senate seat in Texas took a sharp turn this week after CBS and Stephen Colbert gave one Democratic candidate an unintentional boost at precisely the right moment to catch the eye of voters.
Now, his opponent’s supporters are furious and threaten to turn an already acidic race into one reminiscent of the 2016 presidential primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders — and one that could paint a bleak picture for 2028.
Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico were running neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination at the beginning of the week, with various polls showing the two primary candidates both in the lead at times.
That likely shifted on Monday evening, when late-night host Stephen Colbert dropped a bombshell. His network, Colbert said, was demanding that he not air an interview with Talarico in an effort to appease the Trump administration and the FCC. And Colbert, whose show is widely viewed as having been cancelled come May for the same reason, let both the FCC and Trump himself have it during his monologue.
“Let’s just call this what it is: Donald Trump’s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV, because all Trump does is watch TV,” Colbert said.
The result was utterly predictable. Despite denials issued by CBS (which Colbert literally trashed, on-air), the segment with Talarico’s interview blasted through the walls of political circles and Democratic partisans into the mainstream, racking up millions of views in hours. It currently sits at 7.7m views, a figure which will likely be outdated soon. A separate clipped segment with Colbert explaining the network’s decision trailed closely behind in total viewership.
Talarico’s campaign capitalized on the snub. In two days the state representative’s team pulled in a staggering $2.5m in donations, an amount the campaign would typically raise in a concerted effort over several weeks.
Crockett and her supporters, meanwhile, are clearly unhappy. The congresswoman griped about how the CBS incident “just so happened to play out on the very first day of early voting” during a press conference on Wednesday, and said that her opponent had likely been given a “boost” by the fiasco.
“I think it’s probably better that [Talarico] didn’t get on and that they went straight to streaming,” Crockett added during an interview with Jen Psaki, Joe Biden’s former press secretary, on MSNOW. “Because we know that when we resist and when we know that it seems like they’re trying to change the rules and bend to the knee of or bend the knee to this president, that it backfires in historic fashion.”
“I think it probably gave my opponent the boost he was looking for,” she added.
On X, Instagram and TikTok Crockett’s supporters have responded with fury to news of Talarico’s sudden surge in fundraising and support.
“This seems like a setup to boost Talarico,” wrote one on the left-leaning app BlueSky.
Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist, suggested the move was planned by Donald Trump’s allies to help Talarico: “They created more attention, and now they’re going to help Talarico win this primary. Just no restraint from these people.”
The controversy is adding another layer to a race that was already becoming toxic after a Crockett-supporting influencer accused Talarico of making a disparaging comment about Colin Allred, a former candidate in the race, who like Crockett is Black. Talarico strongly denied the accusation, but accusations of outright race-baiting and other ugly language has been traded online by individual supporters of the two candidates in response.
One Democratic-aligned political operative in the state lamented how “stupid” the race had become, and blamed the fixation of Democratic-aligned social media influencers for the tone and tenor of the conversation.
“There's eight people, most of whom don't live in Texas, who are fighting on the internet and that is driving [the conversation],” they told The Independent.
Others fear that it could be a sign of things to come, given the newfound importance the Democratic National Committee placed on reaching new media in 2024. That focus on new media has included both the long-form, casual interviewing space of the podcasting sphere as well as conversations with a new generation of political pundit inhabiting the social media space. It’s even caused some self-reflection from some of those content creators themselves.
“I have just been really gut-wrenched at what this primary has become, and it’s not even because of words that are consistently coming out of each candidate’s mouth,” the Texas-based Democratic influencer Olivia Julianna told the Texas Tribune. “We would all do a lot of good if every once in a while we realized social media is not real life.”
A Texas-based Democratic strategist who spoke to The Independent on Thursday argued that, despite their denials, influencers were adding fuel to nasty intra-party disputes because of the age-old financial incentives presented by ultra-partisan media.
“If you look at the incentives of these people, their incentives are to insert themselves into this race. And like, you know, there's a lot of people saying a lot of things on the internet, but like, largely what we're talking about is a fight between eight people, none of whom work for either campaign,” said Luke Warford, founder of the Agave Democratic Infrastructure Fund.
Warford, who said that the whole ordeal put Talarico a few points ahead of his opponent, explained that the party was witnessing the “downside” of embracing newer media, a necessity for remaining relevant for many campaigns in 2026 but also one that presents a new landscape with new rules for engagement.
“The theory was correct that we should work with influencers. I just think people didn't think through the downsides and the risks of that,” he said.
The two candidates will almost certainly face a runoff after voting concludes on March 3. That runoff will be in May, ensuring that the two candidates and their respective sides of the Democratic base have weeks to snipe at eachother in the media before a final vote occurs.
Luckily for Democrats, the Republican side is no friendlier. A messy battle between incumbent Sen. John Cornyn and two primary challengers has been playing out for months, with Cornyn trailing his closest challenger in the polls and routinely trading insults with the Republican who may unseat him, state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In Texas, both parties are now eyeing their respective primaries nervously as they try to determine how much damage the fallout could cause later in 2026 — or beyond.

Austrian climber found guilty of manslaughter
February 19, 2026A 37-year-old amateur mountaineer was on Thursday given a five-month suspended sentence and a €9,400 fine ($11,100) for gross negligence that resulted in his girlfriend freezing to death on Austria's highest mountain.
The incident took place in January 2025, when the couple climbed the peak of the Grossglockner mountain.
Series of mistakes ended in tragedy
The court heard how the couple had fallen behind their climbing schedule and how the woman became exhausted and was unable to continue, around 50 meters (54 yards) beneath the summit.
After midnight, the man left the 33-year-old woman alone to find help, and she froze to death in bad weather just below the 3,798-meter (12,460-foot) summit.
Prosecutors said he made a series of serious mistakes. The woman was exposed to strong winds and had not been wrapped in an emergency blanket.
The man also didn't make clear that a rescue was needed and failed to answer return calls or messages asking if help was needed, police said.
The defendant said his phone had been on airplane mode in order to save battery power.
"What I want to say is that I am so terribly sorry," the man, who pleaded not guilty, told the court.
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions of them are rare — even in situations where various mistakes were made.
The Austrian Alpine Safety Board says that each year around 8,400 accidents occur on average in the Austrian mountains resulting in around 250 to 300 deaths..

Deer shooting to be facilitated in England to protect woodlands

It will be much easier to shoot deer in England under government plans that aim to curb the damage the animals are doing to the country’s woodlands.
Emma Reynolds, the environment secretary, plans to bring forward new legislation to give landowners and tenants legal rights to shoot deer to protect crops and property.
Because there are no natural predators in England, deer are able to breed quickly and without any population controls. Four non-native deer species – muntjac, Chinese water deer, fallow and sika – have been introduced into the wild and have thrived. Only two deer species present in England, the red and roe, are native.
Overpopulation of deer causes problems for woodland: they eat leaves, buds and sapling stalks, and strip bark from mature trees, which can affect the trees’ health and make them susceptible to disease. Some deer, particularly the sika, rake their antlers against trees, which can kill younger wood.
The government’s legally binding environment targets require it to regenerate woodland equivalent to a net increase of 43,000 hectares (106,255 acres), which will be difficult if the deer population continues to expand. Government figures show 33% of English woodlands are now in unfavourable condition due to the impact of deer, up from 24% in the early 2000s.
The government has mostly focused on protecting trees with guards and fences rather than tackling the deer population. Now, it is announcing a change of approach. Under the plans, all publicly owned or managed land will have deer management plans within 10 years.
National priority areas – where deer are extremely populous and are having a very detrimental impact on woodland – will be identified, with culls targeted there.
There will also be a change to the grant system that pays landowners to shoot deer. Under the new scheme, landowners can be paid to shoot deer when the animals move out of wooded areas, making it easier to target a problematic population, said Emma Dear, the principal officer for tree establishment at Natural England.
She told the Guardian: “This means we can have timely interventions when ecological damage is likely to be greatest. There is an issue because of the way deer move through the landscape and are not constrained to one patch. The grant system was only facilitated in the woodlands; the new strategy will address that.”
Dear added that the lack of natural predators was driving the rise in the deer population across England. Wolves, bears, lynx and other apex predators were hunted to extinction many years ago. Climate breakdown is also a factor.
“Deer are changing their behaviour because of warmer winters. They can overwinter in better conditions and the number of babies they have is higher when the winter is warmer,” Dear said.
Defra sources said there would be a particular focus on reducing the muntjac population as these were listed as an invasive species, and the agency will assess sika and Chinese water deer to see if these can be added to the invasive species list and urgently targeted. These are the three deer species deemed to be causing the most damage.
The nature minister, Mary Creagh, said: “Our trees and native wildlife are under huge strain from deer damage, including from non-native deer species. This government is helping landowners and farmers manage deer impacts more effectively so woodlands can flourish and crops are better protected. These new measures will also help restore nature, boost our homegrown timber industry and protect the millions of trees we are planting across the country.”
The culled deer may be eaten, with Defra looking at how to market and safely get the meat into the supply chain.
Dear said: “There is a section of the strategy that is looking at venison marketing and supporting that industry. Supporting the wild venison sector will hopefully reduce the cost of management.”

Watch: Right-wing activists, lawmaker cross into Gaza to push resettlement

Dozens of right-wing activists crossed into the Gaza Strip by vehicle Thursday evening as part of a campaign to renew Jewish settlement in the territory. Among them was lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech of the far-right Otzma Yehudit party.
IDF reserve forces identified the group after they crossed the border and were working to return them to Israeli territory. The crossing took place at at least two locations in northern Gaza and marked the second such incident this month.
The activists are affiliated with the Nachala settlement movement, which advocates reestablishing Jewish communities in Gaza. In a statement, the group said the entry was part of celebrations marking the Hebrew month of Adar, a festive period on the Jewish calendar leading up to Purim, which commemorates the biblical story of deliverance of the Jewish people as told in the Book of Esther.
“A festive entry today is the first sign ahead of a massive march into Gaza during the Passover holiday,” the group said.
Son Har-Melech said the activists were sending a message about Israel’s future in Gaza.
“In this place, from which the most despicable murderers set out to spread death and destruction, we declare today: Jewish boys and girls will play in the streets of Gaza, thriving cities will rise and life will flourish,” she said. Quoting a verse from the Book of Esther, she added, “The Jews shall rule over their enemies — this is not just a verse in the scroll, it is the reality we are building here on the ground. Gaza will be Jewish, because only this will ensure true victory and security for the people of Israel.”
Children were among those who crossed into Gaza, according to the group.
Nachala said the move was part of an “unbroken sequence of actions” aimed at restoring Jewish settlement in the territory. “While overseas they are launching [U.S. President Donald] Trump’s Board of Peace, here on the ground the message is clear and unequivocal: Gaza is our ancestral inheritance and there will be no foreign rule there,” the movement said.
Tzvi Elimelech Sharbaf, head of the Nachala movement, said the group’s entry into Gaza “with song and dance” was intended as a response to any plans for foreign governance in the territory.
“In the month of Adar, we are reminded that light dispels darkness,” he said. “The Israeli public demands Jewish settlement, which alone is victory, and this entry is the opening shot ahead of the massive march during the upcoming Passover holiday. The people of Israel are returning to Gaza, returning home.”

MAGA Republican endorses his Democratic wife for public office in Nebraska: ‘Susanne will be my one Democrat exception’
Pete Ricketts and Susanne Shore have been married for 28 years despite their opposing political views
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Republican Senator Pete Ricketts, a Trump-aligned lawmaker, endorsed his Democratic wife, Susanne Shore, for a seat on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents, claiming she would be his only liberal vote for the year.
“I usually vote straight Republican, but Susanne will be my one Democrat exception in 2026!” Ricketts said in a statement, obtained by the Nebraska Examiner.
Shore is seeking a seat on the college’s board of regents, which provides policymaking guidance and oversight for public universities and colleges, to help leadership recover from a turbulent year and make higher education accessible for all students.
Ricketts, who served as governor of Nebraska from 2015 until 2023, said Shore has a “deep love” for the state and would be “an outstanding voice” for the university.
Ricketts and Shore, who have been married for 28 years, have opposing political views. They have donated to opposing political parties and endorsed opposing candidates in presidential elections – even while Ricketts was governor. But they have remained a team throughout the divisive political climate in the United States.
“There’s lots of discussion, but it’s always respectful, and we always listen as much as we speak,” Shore told the Nebraska Examiner, adding that Ricketts is “nothing but supportive” of her political ambitions.
Shore is entering a crowded field of at least four other Democrats seeking to take over Elizabeth O’Connor’s seat on the university’s board of regents.
O’Connor stepped down from her seat in January after being charged with a felony for allegedly driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that left one person seriously injured.
O’Connor’s departure arrived shortly before the university’s chancellor of three years, Rodney Bennett, stepped down from his role following a no-confidence vote from faculty. Bennett had been criticized for controversial budget cuts.
Shore said her experience serving as Nebraska’s first lady and working for the University of South Dakota’s Dean of Residential Life gives her insight into college operations.
“I’ll be able to walk in and have legitimacy with anybody that’s in the room with me, a level of trust,” Shore said.
The University of Nebraska’s Board of Regents primary will be held May 12.
While Shore pursues her own political career, Ricketts is also focused on his re-election.
Ricketts was appointed to serve as Nebraska’s senator in 2022 after former Senator Ben Sasse stepped down. Ricketts then ran in the state’s 2024 special election, defeating the Democratic nominee by roughly 25 percentage points.
Trump has endorsed Ricketts in the upcoming midterms.

Trump says 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil 'floating very nicely' to Houston
'We took 50 million barrels of oil. It's right now floating very nicely and (in) extremely large ships to Houston,' says US president
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Thursday that 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil are currently en route to Houston, Texas.
"You've heard about Venezuela, and we're helping them very much with their oil. They got a lot of oil...We took 50 million barrels of oil. It's right now floating very nicely and (in) extremely large ships to Houston," he said at an event in the state of Georgia.
Trump also hailed Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez.
"The president's doing an excellent job, getting along great," he added.
After months of heightened tensions, the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 3, which triggered a series of developments, including the swearing-in of Rodriguez, the passage of reforms to the country’s flagship oil law, and the release of some political prisoners.

Climber is convicted over girlfriend's death near Austria's highest peak
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
INNSBRUCK, Austria, Feb 19 - An Austrian court late on Thursday found a 37-year-old amateur mountaineer guilty of manslaughter over his girlfriend's death of cold near Austria's highest summit after he left her to fetch help, local media reported.
The case is unusual because while climbing accidents are common, prosecutions over them are rare, even in situations like this one where various mistakes were made.
The court in the western city of Innsbruck handed the Austrian man a five-month suspended prison sentence and a 9,400 euro ($11,100) fine for causing her death in January 2025 by gross negligence, an offence that carries a maximum prison sentence of three years.
The trial has raised questions about the extent of legal liability in the high mountains, an inherently dangerous environment that climbers generally explore at their own risk.
After a day's climbing in which they fell far behind schedule, the woman was exhausted and unable to go on about 50 metres (yards) below the summit of the Grossglockner mountain on a freezing winter's night, the court heard.
The defendant, identified as Thomas P., left his girlfriend Kerstin G. exposed to strong winds, without wrapping her in her emergency blanket or bivouac bag for reasons he could not fully explain, to fetch help in a shelter on the other side of the summit. The equipment stayed in her rucksack.
A short call to the mountain police did not trigger a search since the police said he did not make clear they needed rescuing, and he failed to answer calls back or WhatsApp messages asking if they needed help. The defendant said his phone had been in airplane mode to save battery.
"What I want to say is that I am so terribly sorry," Thomas P., who pleaded not guilty, told the court. REUTERS

Vologda’s governor said his people were ‘dying out.’ In one year, he cut abortions by 82 percent, sending women fleeing to neighboring regions for a procedure that remains legal in Russia.

Vologda’s governor said his people were ‘dying out.’ In one year, he cut abortions by 82 percent, sending women fleeing to neighboring regions for a procedure that remains legal in Russia.
Abortion remains legal in Russia, but access to the procedure has become almost impossible for women in at least one region: Vologda. Governor Georgy Filimonov treats this fact as his administration’s crowning achievement — a feat he has managed through financial incentives, administrative pressure, and deliberate obstruction. The numbers tell the story: Abortions in the region fell 81.6 percent last year. The independent outlet Glasnaya Media documented the crackdown in a recent report. Meduza reviews Glasnaya’s findings.
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
Shutting down access
Although abortion remains legal under Russian federal law — and medical facilities are required by the Health Ministry to provide it — women in Vologda now find themselves turned away from clinics, redirected across regional lines, and subjected to coercive counseling. When a Glasnaya correspondent called private clinics across the region’s capital city to schedule an abortion, every office refused. “Our clinic does not provide that service. Management’s orders,” a receptionist at one clinic told her, refusing to suggest alternatives.
The obstacles extend to public hospitals. In the spring of 2025, Anna, 39, a mother of four whose eldest son has a child of his own, sought an abortion after an unplanned pregnancy. Armed with the required test results, a psychologist’s note, and a referral from her gynecologist, Anna arrived at the Vologda city maternity hospital, only to be shown the door. A nurse “rudely” told her nothing would be done for her, and a second psychologist showed her “models of embryos,” telling her she would be “murdering a full-fledged child.” The psychologist also urged Anna to have the baby and put it up for adoption. The hospital cited “a verbal order from the regional health ministry banning abortions in the Vologda region, as well as moral and religious considerations.”
In the end, Anna traveled to the neighboring Yaroslavl region for the procedure.
Afterward, she filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office, and the maternity hospital’s acting head was convicted of violating the facility’s licensing requirements and fined 15,000 rubles (about $200) — the minimum penalty allowed under civil statutes.
Filimonov’s population preoccupation
Georgy Filimonov, who took office in September 2024, has made demographic alarmism the centerpiece of his tenure. He has repeatedly declared that Vologda — which he calls “the most [ethnic] Russian region of Russia” — is “dying out,” citing a 3.4-percent population decline, well above the national average of 0.4 percent. He has framed restricting abortion as a frontline response to demographic collapse.
Vologda’s governor has been explicit about the financial machinery driving his campaign. As compensation for “lost abortion revenue,” the regional government paid private clinics 1 million rubles ($13,000) each to stop performing the procedure, earmarking the money for “equipment and furniture upgrades.” Doctors who talk a patient out of an abortion receive 5,000 rubles ($65); if that patient carries the pregnancy to term, the bonus rises to 25,000 rubles ($325). The results have been dramatic: Abortions in the region fell from 1,679 in 2024 to 309 in 2025 — a decline of 81.6 percent.
The legal framework for the de facto ban is a regional law that prohibits “inducing” a woman to have an abortion. The law does not ban the procedure itself, but its deliberately vague definition of “inducement” has created a climate of legal uncertainty that discourages physicians from so much as mentioning abortion as an option. “Frightened doctors simply stall for time,” State Duma deputy Alexey Kanaev, one of the region’s few vocal critics of the abortion crackdown, wrote in May 2025:
Unnecessary referrals to the regional center pile up. Equipment mysteriously “breaks down,” and the next available appointment is always “a week or two away.” Tricks and manipulations, in other words. Does any of this address the demographic crisis? No.
On social media, Kanaev has savaged Filimonov’s abortion policies, stressing that the procedure remains legal under federal law and guaranteed by Health Ministry regulations. “No region and no official has the right to violate federal legislation,” Kanaev wrote in February 2025.
Beyond abortion
Vologda’s assault on women’s reproductive rights extends to birth control. Pharmacies throughout the region are reportedly refusing to dispense emergency contraception such as Postinor — which requires no prescription under Russian law — particularly to younger women. Mifepristone-based medications used for medical abortions have vanished from shelves after authorities added them to a controlled-substances list.
Meanwhile, Filimonov has pursued what critics are calling a “birthrate import” strategy, offering payments of up to 300,000 rubles (almost $4,000) for children registered in the Vologda region, regardless of where the mother lives — a practice he describes as encouraging “obstetric tourism.” New billboards in the region’s capital urge men to “invest in the eternal” and to spend their evenings “loving their wives.” Local media report that residents are underwhelmed, mocking the signs as “idiotic” and asking what, exactly, “loving your wife” is supposed to mean.

Trump says Obama ‘made big mistake’ with alien revelation
- Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of improperly disclosing classified information by suggesting aliens are real, an allegation made without supporting evidence.
- Obama's initial comments on a podcast stated, “They're real, but I haven't seen them,” and denied any hidden facilities like Area 51.
- Obama later clarified on Instagram that his belief in extraterrestrial life is based on statistical probability in a vast universe, not classified information, and he saw no evidence of contact during his presidency.
- "He took it out of classified information ... He’s not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Georgia. "He made a big mistake."
- Pentagon reports from 2022 and 2024 have found no evidence of alien visits, crash landings, or extraterrestrial technology, attributing most sightings to misidentified ordinary objects.

Cuban families receive 'Made in Mexico' essentials as crisis worsens
Mexico is sending major food aid to Cuba as the island struggles with fuel shortages and widespread blackouts
- Bookmark
Guillermo Beltrán walked away with two heavy bags on Thursday, each containing an essential haul — rice, beans, amaranth and crackers — complemented by a bottle of oil, large cans of sardines and canned peaches. Every label carried the same simple phrase “Made in Mexico.”
Beltrán, a 70-year-old Cuban father of two, was one of several hundred recipients of Mexican humanitarian assistance, ordered by President Claudia Sheinbaum in support of the island nation as it faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages worsened by a U.S oil embargo.
“I feel very grateful,” said Beltrán. “The Mexican president should be praised to the skies for showing such concern and courage.”
Two Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in Cuba last week, two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on countries that sell oil to the island, deepening an already severe economic and energy crisis in the Caribbean nation.
The ships brought about 800 tons of goods, and another 1,500 tons of powdered milk and beans are expected to be loaded in the coming days.
The Cuban government said the aid will support vulnerable families with underweight children or elderly members in Havana and the provinces of Mayabeque and Artemisa. Earlier this week, state television aired footage of the supplies arriving at bodegas — the state-run shops that distribute basic goods to citizens through a national ration book system.
The bags received by Beltrán were taken directly to his home by the manager of his neighborhood bodega in Havana.
“People are very grateful for these donations,” Roberto Román, the 28-year-old manager, told The Associated Press. He is responsible for 1,780 customers, distributed among 850 families.
The economic crisis gripping Cuba since 2020 has been compounded by intensified U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing a change in the island’s political model. These pressures led to critical shortages and severe blackouts that peaked in early 2026.
Cuba relied heavily on oil shipments from Venezuela that were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader.
Because Cuba produces only 40% of its required fuel, it remains highly vulnerable to external blockades. While strong allies like Russia and China have condemned the U.S. measures, their support has remained largely symbolic thus far.

King Charles’ brother Andrew released by police
King Charles’ younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was released from police custody on the evening of Feb 19 after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Feb 19, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police.
Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
Trump appears to give Iran 10-15 days to make deal
President Donald Trump warned Iran on Feb 19 that it must make a deal over its nuclear programme or “really bad things” will happen, and appeared to set a deadline of no more than 10 to 15 days before the US might take action.
Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fuelled fears of a wider war, Mr Trump said negotiations with Iran to end the tense standoff were going well but insisted Tehran has to reach a “meaningful” agreement.
“Otherwise bad things happen,” Mr Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran, told the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump hosts inaugural meeting of Board of Peace
US President Donald Trump told the first meeting of his Board of Peace on Feb 19 that US$7 billion (S$8.8 billion) has been contributed to a Gaza reconstruction fund that aims to rebuild the enclave once Hamas disarms, an objective that is far from becoming a reality.
The disarmament of Hamas militants and accompanying withdrawal of Israeli troops, the size of the reconstruction fund and the flow of humanitarian aid to the war-battered populace of Gaza are among the major questions likely to test the effectiveness of the board in the weeks and months ahead.
In a flurry of announcements at the end of a long, winding speech, Mr Trump said the United States will make a contribution of US$10 billion to the Board of Peace. He said contributing nations had raised US$7 billion as an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction.
US state sues Apple over iCloud child sex abuse images
The US state of West Virginia on Feb 19 said it is suing Apple over child sex abuse material people tuck away in its iCloud online storage service.
The suit filed by Attorney-General John Bohen McCuskey in a state court accuses the iPhone maker of letting iCloud be used to store and distribute such content, often referred to as child pornography.
Apple has been under pressure from some child safety advocates due to a decision several years ago not to jeopardise user privacy and security by allowing scanning of data stored in iCloud.
US threatens to leave IEA if net zero focus remains
The United States stepped up pressure on the International Energy Agency on Feb 19 to drop net zero from its agenda, giving it a year to do so or risk Washington exiting the organisation.
Speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the 52-year-old agency should return to its founding mission of ensuring energy security.
The Paris-based IEA was created to coordinate responses to major disruptions of supplies after the 1973 oil crisis, but it has broadened its focus to include renewable energy and net zero goals under executive director Fatih Birol.

FIFA president announces 'true partnership' with Board of Peace for Gaza
Gianni Infantino says soccer can help 'rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust'
HAMILTON, Canada
FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced a "true partnership" between the world soccer governing body and the Board of Peace on Thursday, outlining plans for major soccer infrastructure projects in the Gaza Strip aimed at rebuilding communities through sport.
Describing soccer as a unifying global force, Infantino at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, DC said: "First point: football, or soccer as it's called here, is the world's universal language. It is spoken by 6 billion people, 6 billion fans who have the same feelings."
"It's about hope, it's about joy, it's about happiness. It's about coming together, and it's about uniting the world. We'll unite the world here this summer during the World Cup," he added.
Stressing that peace is essential to achieving that unity, Infantino announced "a true partnership between the Board of Peace and FIFA."
"And I'm very proud and very happy to announce this," he added, saying that after hearing presentations at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, "we need to help. We need to do something."
Noting that FIFA's contribution would focus not only on physical infrastructure in the Strip, he said: “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about."
Infantino also presented a promotional video at the meeting detailing the scope of the initiative.
"Through the partnership, a complete football ecosystem" will be created in Gaza, the video explained, saying that it will include the construction of football pitches, FIFA arenas, academies and a national stadium.
It announced that the plan includes 50 FIFA Arena mini-pitches at an estimated cost of $50,000 per unit, representing a $2.5 million investment. Five full-size pitches will be built in five different districts at around $1 million per pitch.
The initiative also envisions a FIFA Academy with an estimated investment of $15 million and a national stadium for 20,000 to 25,000 spectators valued at around $50 million.

ECB fines JPMorgan $14.3M over miscalculated assets

ISTANBUL
The European Central Bank has imposed two administrative penalties totaling €12.18 million ($14.34 million) on JPMorgan for reporting wrongly calculated risk-weighted assets.
The bank reported lower risk-weighted assets than required between 2019 and 2024, the ECB stated on Thursday.
This occurred because the bank misclassified corporate exposures for 15 consecutive quarters and applied a lower risk-weight for credit risk to them than banking rules prescribe.
JPMorgan also unduly excluded certain transactions for 21 consecutive quarters when calculating risk-weighted assets for its credit valuation adjustment risk.
The central bank classified the credit risk breach as "severe" and the credit valuation adjustment risk breach as "moderately severe" due to the bank committing both with serious negligence driven by evident deficiencies in its internal processes.
The bank reported wrongly calculated figures to the European Central Bank, which prevented the authority from having a comprehensive view of its risk profile.
Capital ratios are key indicators of a bank's capital strength and its ability to absorb losses, and as a result of underestimating its risk-weighted assets, JPMorgan reported higher capital ratios than it should have done.
The bank has the right to challenge the decision before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Former Biden official says US must work with allies to counter China
Kurt Campbell warns Trump’s strategy risks weakening Washington leverage as policy machinery erodes and Beijing sharpens its approach
Working closely with like-minded countries remains the most effective strategy to counter an increasingly powerful China – in marked contrast to the policies of US President Donald Trump – said a former senior US official, while admitting that the Joe Biden administration made some key mistakes that undercut its own effectiveness.
Campbell, now chairman of the Asia Group consultancy, said Trump’s approach to China has inherent contradictions. At times he seems keen to craft an entirely new US-China relationship built on business deals that benefit “him and the United States”. At other times he seems to want a pause to build US reserves of critical minerals and bolster the US military.
“In many respects, this ambiguity is designed not just to keep China off balance, but frankly, to keep elements in American society guessing what President Trump’s ultimate outcomes and desires are,” he said at an event sponsored by Foreign Policy magazine.
Strategic ambiguity – the idea that Washington will not say whether it will defend Taiwan if the mainland launches an attack – has been a cornerstone of US policy.

Mexico and El Salvador make big cocaine seizures at sea as US continues lethal strikes
El Salvador and Mexico have reported major cocaine seizures at sea this week, as U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats leave 11 people dead
- Bookmark
The navies of El Salvador and Mexico announced drug seizures in the Pacific Ocean this week of more than 10 tonnes of cocaine, in contrast to deadly strikes by the U.S. government that just this week left 11 people dead on three boats suspected of carrying drugs in Latin American waters.
The latest announcement came Thursday, when Mexico said it had seized nearly four tonnes of suspected drugs and detained three people from a semisubmersible craft, 250 nautical miles (463 kilometers) south of the port of Manzanillo.
Mexican Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said via X that the seizure from the sleek, low-riding boat with three visible motors brought the weekly total to nearly 10 tonnes, but he did not provide detail on the other seizures.
Mexican authorities said the seizure was made with intelligence shared U.S. Northern Command and the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South.
On Sunday, El Salvador’s navy announced the largest drug seizure in the country’s history of 6.6 tonnes of cocaine. The navy had intercepted a 180-foot boat registered to Tanzania, 380 miles (611 kilometers) southwest of the coast. Navy divers found 330 packages of cocaine hidden in the boat’s ballast tanks. Ten men were arrested from Colombia, Nicaragua, Panama and Ecuador.
On Thursday, Salvadoran authorities gave access to the seized ship FMS Eagle, which had just arrived in the port of La Union. More than 200 wrapped bundles were lined up on the deck.
The Trump administration has pressured Mexico to make more drug seizures over the past year. The trafficking of drugs like fentanyl was the president’s justification for tariffs on Mexican imports.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has responded with a more aggressive stance toward drug cartels than her predecessor, that has included sending dozens of drug trafficking prisoners to the United States for prosecution.
Sheinbaum has also expressed her disagreement with strikes by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean against boats suspected of carrying drugs.
At least 145 people have been killed in those strikes since the U.S. government began targeting those it calls “narcoterrorists” last September.
The U.S. strikes this week included two vessels carrying four people each in the eastern Pacific Ocean and another boat in the Caribbean carrying three people. The administration provided images of the boats being destroyed, but not evidence they were carrying drugs.

The US stock market saw a negative trend amid rising tensions between the US and Iran and a decline in alternative asset managers' shares.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.54%, or 267.5 points, to close at 49,395.16.
The Nasdaq dropped 0.31%, or 70.91 points, to 22,682.73, while the S&P 500 declined 0.28%, or 19.42 points, to 6,861.89.
The Volatility Index (VIX), also known as the "fear index," rose by 3.11% to 20.23 points.
On the geopolitical front, as news flow regarding increasing tensions between the US and Iran was monitored, US President Donald Trump said: “It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran, and we have to make a meaningful deal.
"Otherwise bad things happen."
Investors remained cautious due to tensions between the US and Iran, while oil prices continued to rise.
Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices increased by more than 2% during the day.
Meanwhile, shares of other companies fell after alternative asset management firm Blue Owl Capital restricted withdrawals from one of its funds and decided to sell $1.4 billion worth of assets from three of its funds.
Blue Owl Capital's shares fell 5.9%, while shares of companies such as Blackstone and Apollo Global Management lost 5.4% and 5.2%, respectively.
In addition, as investors assessed the financial results of US retail giant Walmart, the company's revenue and profit for the three-month period exceeded expectations, but its profit forecast for the current fiscal year fell short of expectations; Walmart's shares lost 1.4% in value.
On the macroeconomic data front, the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time in the US fell by 23,000 from the previous week to 206,000 in the week ending February 14, falling below market expectations.
The US trade deficit rose 32.6% from the previous month to $70.3 billion in the last month of last year, reaching its highest level since July.

West Virginia sues Apple over child sex abuse material stored and shared on iCloud
Unknown

West Virginia’s attorney general filed a lawsuit on Thursday accusing Apple of allowing its iCloud service to become a vehicle for distributing child sexual abuse material.
The state alleges that the company facilitated the spread of child sexual abuse material by declining to deploy tools that scan photos and videos and detect such material in iCloud users’ collections.
JB McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing user privacy over child safety. His office called the case the first of its kind by a government agency over the distribution of child sexual abuse material on Apple’s data storage platform.
“These images are a permanent record of a child’s trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed,” McCuskey said in the statement. “This conduct is despicable, and Apple’s inaction is inexcusable.”
Apple responded with a blanket denial to the allegations: “At Apple, protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do. We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids.” The company emphasized its controls that prevent children from uploading or receiving nude images, though West Virginia’s lawsuit aims at abusers’ use of Apple devices and services.
In 2020, an executive in charge of fraud detection at Apple texted a colleague: “We are the greatest platform for distributing child porn.” The exchange was made public during the trial between Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games.
A group of victims of child sexual exploitation sued Apple in 2024, making similar allegations, for $1.2bn in damages. The suit is ongoing. The same year, the UK’s National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) accused Apple of vastly undercounting how often child sexual abuse material appeared in its products. In a year, child predators used Apple’s iCloud, iMessage and FaceTime to store and exchange CSAM in a higher number of cases in England and Wales alone than the company reported across all other countries combined, according to police data obtained by the NSPCC. Apple did not comment on the finding at the time.
Apple routinely makes far fewer reports of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) than Google or Meta, according to data published by NCMEC.
The company has considered scanning images saved in private iCloud accounts but abandoned the approach after concerns about user privacy and safety, including worries that it could be exploited by governments looking for other material for censorship or arrest.
McCuskey’s office filed the lawsuit in Mason county circuit court. The lawsuit seeks statutory and punitive damages and asks to have a judge force Apple to implement more effective measures to detect abusive material and implement safer product designs.
Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft and other platform providers check uploaded photos or emailed attachments against a database of identifiers of known child sex abuse material provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearinghouses.
Until 2022, Apple took a different approach. It did not scan all files uploaded to its iCloud storage offerings, and the data was not end-to-end encrypted, meaning law enforcement officials could access it with a warrant.
Reuters in 2020 reported that Apple planned end-to-end encryption for iCloud, which would have put data into a form unusable by law enforcement officials. It abandoned the plan after the FBI complained it would harm investigations.
In August 2021, Apple announced NeuralHash, which it designed to balance the detection of child abuse material with privacy by scanning images on users’ devices before upload.
The system was criticized by security researchers who worried it could yield false reports of abuse material, and it sparked a backlash from privacy advocates who claimed it could be expanded to permit government surveillance.
A month later, Apple delayed the introduction of NeuralHash before canceling it in December 2022, the state said in its statement. That same month, Apple launched an option for end-to-end encryption for iCloud data.
The state said NeuralHash was inferior to other tools and could be easily evaded. It said Apple stores and synchronizes data through iCloud without proactive abuse material detection, allowing such images to circulate.
While Apple did not go through with the effort to scan images being uploaded to iCloud, it did implement a feature called Communication Safety that blurs nudity and other sensitive content being sent to or from a child’s device.
Federal law requires US-based technology companies to report abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple in 2023 made 267 reports, compared with 1.47m by Google and 30.6m by Meta Platforms, the state said.
The state’s claims mirror allegations in a proposed class-action lawsuit filed against Apple in late 2024 in federal court in California by individuals depicted in such images.
Apple has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, saying the firm is shielded from liability under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides broad protections to internet companies from lawsuits over content generated by users.

Bangarra Dance Theatre wins international award for creating 'radical change'

Bangarra Dance Theatre wins Golden Lion at international dance festival Venice Danza 2026
Bangarra Dance Theatre, Australia's leading Indigenous dance company, has won the prestigious international award, the Golden Lion, at the Venice Biennale.
The prize for lifetime achievement in dance, first awarded in 1995, will be presented during the international festival of contemporary dance, Venice Danza, which kicks off in July.
The company's win follows Back to Back Theatre, a disability-led theatre group from Geelong, taking home the Golden Lion at Venice's international theatre festival in 2024.
In the same year, Bigambul and Kamilaroi artist Archie Moore won the Golden Lion at the Venice Art Biennale.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains names of people who have died.
Award-winning British choreographer Wayne McGregor, the outgoing director of Venice Danza, described Bangarra in a statement as a company that has "caused a seismic shift in our understanding of dance and the cultural context in which it is performed".
"Their integrity, passion, commitment and power have often driven radical change, frequently overcoming great challenge and resistance," he said.
Previous recipients of the Golden Lion for dance include late American dancer Merce Cunningham, German choreographer Pina Bausch and American choreographer William Forsythe.
Bangarra — whose name means "to make fire" in Wiradjuri language — was established in 1989 by the late Gumbaynggirr dancer and Vietnam veteran Rob Bryant, African American dancer Carole Y Johnson and South African dancer Cheryl Stone.
Johnson was also a co-founder of the National Aboriginal and Islander Skills Association (NAISDA) dance school.
Bangarra is led by Mirning choreographer Frances Rings, who became artistic director after Stephen Page, a Nunukul/Ngugi man of the Quandamooka peoples and a Munaldjali man of the Yugambeh nation, who ran the company for 30 years.
The win at the Venice Biennale makes Bangarra the first company and first First Nations performers to receive the award since it was first presented.
Bangarra is best known for its performance of Bennelong in 2017 and Dark Emu in 2018, a dance adaptation of Bruce Pascoe's book. It has toured the world, including London, Paris, New York and Tokyo.
Its process for making work is culturally embedded, with choreographers and other creatives often visiting Indigenous communities multiple times to better understand their stories.
"It's important to be able to be taken out onto Country, be told the creation stories while you are on Country, to understand how important those living systems are," Rings told ABC Arts in 2022.
The company will premiere its next show Flora with Australian Ballet in Melbourne in March, before touring Sydney, with the show Sheltering also visiting Brisbane and Canberra from May.
In Flora, 35 dancers, alongside Kalkangu musician William Barton and Meriam Samsep designer Grace Lillian Lee, will bring to life the evolution of Australian plants and demonstrate the resilience of Indigenous peoples.
Sheltering brings together three Bangarra works. Two were born from the company's emerging artist festival Dance Clan: Grounded by Indjalandji-Dhidhanu and Alyewarre woman Glory Tuohy-Daniell; and the dance movie Brown Boys by Gamilaroi and Tongan man Daniel Mateo and Cass Mortimer. The final work on the bill is Sheoak by Rings, which premiered in 2015.
At Venice Danza in July, Bangarra is set to perform Terrain, choreographed by Rings in 2012, which examines the impact of colonisation on the natural environment, and the important role that Indigenous peoples and knowledges play in caring for Country.
"Terrain's really a timeless work because Country's always going to be a priority for Indigenous people. It's always going to be the cornerstone of our existence," Rings told ABC Arts in 2022.

Meta is accused of harming young users with its addictive features.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has appeared in a Los Angeles court to answer questions about accusations of harm that his company causes to young users.
The landmark trial is looking into the addictive aspects of the use of social media.
It’s part of a big wave of growing anger against tech platforms, which are said to contribute to addictive behaviour.
As a response, some countries have already started restricting access to youngsters.
Others have gone as far as banning their use for children younger than 16.
But can a court case change things?
And what role should families play in controlling their kids’ excessive use of social media?

Gaza deaths in war’s first 15 months higher than reported, study says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM – More than 75,000 Palestinians were killed in the first 15 months of Israel’s military assault
The peer-reviewed study, published on Feb 18, found that women, children and the elderly comprised some 56.2 per cent of violent deaths in Gaza during that period, a composition that it said roughly aligned with reporting by Gaza’s Health Ministry.
The field work was conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, run by Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, who has carried out public opinion polling in the West Bank and Gaza for decades. The lead author is Professor Michael Spagat, who teaches at Royal Holloway, University of London.
The study is the first independent population survey of mortality in the Gaza Strip, said its authors, whose research involved surveying 2,000 Palestinian households over seven days starting on Dec 30, 2024.
“The combined evidence suggests that, as at Jan 5, 2025, 3 to 4 per cent of the population of the Gaza Strip had been killed violently and there have been a substantial number of non-violent deaths caused indirectly by the conflict,” the authors wrote.
UN has long deemed ministry figures to be reliable
The Gaza death toll has been bitterly disputed since Israel’s assault began after the Hamas-led Oct 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel.
Israel has questioned those tallies, citing Hamas control of the ministry, though a senior military officer told Israeli media in January that its figures were broadly accurate – a view the army later said did not reflect official data.
Lancet researchers said their analysis contradicts claims of inflation and suggests the ministry numbers are, if anything, conservative under extreme conditions.
Mortality calculation based on face-to-face interviews
Researchers who published a statistical analysis in 2025 for The Lancet, its flagship journal, found the Health Ministry likely undercounted deaths by about 40 per cent during the first nine months of the war. The new research published on Feb 18 appears to suggest an undercount by a similar margin.
Field staff, mostly female and experienced in surveying, conducted face-to-face interviews with Palestinians from households across Gaza’s different districts, the authors wrote. The questionnaire, reviewed by Reuters, asks respondents to list individuals in their immediate household who were killed.
“We calculated mortality estimates as weighted sums. Each individual in the sample received a weight representing the number of people in the Gaza Strip they represent,” the authors wrote.
The authors wrote that the survey was the first on Gaza mortality that did not rely on administrative records from the Health Ministry. They said their results on violent deaths had a 95 per cent confidence interval, a value that indicates how accurately a pollster has captured a data point.
There were an estimated 16,300 non-violent deaths during the first 15 months of the war, caused by disease, pre-existing conditions, accidents or other causes not directly related to combat, the authors wrote. These are separate from the 75,200 violent deaths estimated during that period.
Hamas-led militants killed more than 1,200 people and took over 250 hostages during their 2023 attack on southern Israel, according to Israeli tallies. The hostages and the remains of those killed in captivity were released during ceasefires.
Hamas has confirmed the deaths of military leaders in fighting with Israel but has rarely disclosed fatalities among its fighters. REUTERS

Nearly one year after masked federal agents grabbed her off the street, Tufts University scholar Rumeysa Ozturk is officially a doctor.
Ozturk, who is studying media use among children and young people, has earned her PhD from the university’s Department of Child Study and Human Development.
“My studies, research and professional work focus on how positive media use among children and young people can nurture more kindness and compassion in the world,” she wrote Wednesday on LinkedIn.
“Despite the very brutal, illegal and unjustifiable experiences I faced over the last year, I remain hopeful that our world can become a gentler and more peaceful place,” she added.
Last month, an immigration court judge terminated deportation proceedings against Ozturk, whose arrest last March by masked agents near her home in Massachusetts is among the defining images of the Trump administration’s deportation efforts targeting international students who spoke out against Israel’s war in Gaza.
Homeland Security failed to prove that the Turkish scholar needed to be deported, and an immigration court judge terminated the case, effectively ending the government’s threat of removal while she continues to challenge the constitutionality of her arrest and weeks-long detention in Louisiana.
Last year, Trump administration officials publicly accused Ozturk of engaging in activities “in support of Hamas,” but internal documents from State Department officials admitted they did not possess any evidence.
Ozturk had co-authored an op-ed in a student newspaper that criticized university leaders for dismissing students’ concerns about the war. Administration officials — relying on a pro-Israel activist group that created an online directory of student activists — canceled her student visa and signed a warrant for her arrest in response.
She was held inside an ICE detention center in Louisiana, more than 1,000 miles away, for more than six weeks.
Last year, while testifying in an orange prison jumpsuit and taupe hijab, Ozturk said it was “impossible” to pursue her academic work while in ICE detention.
“The work I do is very meaningful,” she said.
She hoped her work can “contribute to the well-being and development of children all around the world,” she said.
Ozturk, whose faculty adviser testified to her intimate connections within her department and the broader Tufts community, also described how she organized support for academics who work with children in areas of global conflict, “from Gaza to Israel, from Russia to Ukraine, from Sudan to Yemen, from Cameroon to Afghanistan.”
“All of them are ours – [children] experiencing armed conflict around the world,” said Ozturk, who was clutching her heart.
Her adviser Sara K. Johnson described Ozturk as an “expert” whose “expertise is absolutely critical” in fields of study connected to social media use and impacts to child development.
“From our children kept in federal detention centers in inhumane conditions, to our children in Gaza facing a genocide, from our children of war everywhere from Ukraine to Sudan, to our BIPOC children facing racial injustices daily and our refugee children whose childhoods are stolen, the oppression is connected and global, and so our compassion must be equally universal,” Ozturk wrote Wednesday.
“In the middle of these hard times, I am holding a moment to celebrate this joy as a new beginning to work even harder, turning years of research, volunteering, and teaching into meaningful change for children, youth, and communities,” she wrote. “I hope this news brings some joy to all who need to hear it.”
She added: “As an important side note, I would like to be called Dr. Ozturk, not Miss Ozturk, from now on.”

Alysa Liu gives US its first women's figure skating Olympic gold in 24 years, bests Japanese rivals
Alysa Liu won Olympic gold for the U.S. in women’s figure skating, ending a 24-year drought
- Bookmark
Alysa Liu delivered the U.S. its first women’s figure skating Olympic gold medal in 24 years, performing a near-flawless free skate Thursday night in a glittering golden dress to upstage Japanese rivals Kaori Sakamoto and Ami Nakai at the Milan Cortina Games.
The 20-year-old from the San Francisco Bay Area, who had walked away from the sport after the Beijing Games four years ago only to launch a remarkable comeback, finished with a career-best 226.79 points. Nakai and Sakamoto, skating right behind her, each made a mistake on a combination sequence, and that made the difference in the medals.
Sakamoto had 224.90 points to earn a silver to go with her bronze from Beijing. Nakai finished third with 219.16 points.
The moment Nakai’s score was read after the final program of the night, teammate Amber Glenn jumped onto the kiss-and-cry stand and raised Liu’s hand in triumph. Liu sheepishly turned and applauded the 17-year-old Nakai, who raced over and hugged her.
It’s the first gold medal for an American woman since 2002, when Sarah Hughes stood atop the podium in Salt Lake City.
Glenn finished in fifth behind Mone Chiba of Japan, a stunning rebound from a disastrous short program Tuesday night. Her season-best free skate gave a score of 214.91 points, and just about landed her on the podium as well.
Glenn pumped her first and fought back tears when her score was read, then she took a seat in the new “leader’s chair.”
She wound up sitting there for quite a while.
Through an ice resurfacing. And through eight programs by other skaters, including American teammate Isabeau Levito, whose fall on her opening triple flip in an otherwise elegant performance kept her from taking over the top spot herself.
Adeliia Petrosian, the 18-year-old Russian competing as a neutral athlete at the Milan Cortina Games, tried the only quadruple jump during the women’s competition but fell on the quad toe loop. She was clean the rest of the way, but the points Petrosian lost on that fall ended up leaving her less than a half-point behind the leader.
It was Chiba — the ninth skater to follow Glenn — that finally took over first place.
That didn’t last long with Liu next on the ice.

What is Iftar during Ramadan and why does the time change every night?
- Iftar, the evening meal marking the daily fast's conclusion during Ramadan, holds profound significance for Muslims worldwide.
- As the primary meal for those observing the fast, it is consumed at sunset, known as Maghrib. Its precise timing shifts daily throughout the holy month, adapting to changing daylight hours, a phenomenon particularly evident in countries like the UK.
- Beyond its crucial role for health and nutrition, Iftar carries immense spiritual weight. It is believed to be a time when Allah (SWT) extends special mercy and love to those who have fasted, with particular blessings for individuals who provide food for others.
- A deeply rooted tradition, or Sunnah, encourages Muslims to break their fast with dates before their main meal.
- This practice emulates the Prophet (PBUH), who enjoyed and advocated dates, typically using fresh ones, then dried, or water if neither was available.

Trump accuses Obama of revealing classified information about aliens
During a podcast interview, the former president was asked if aliens were real
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of improperly disclosing classified information by suggesting aliens are real, an allegation made without supporting evidence.
"He took it out of classified information ... He’s not supposed to be doing that," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling to Georgia. "He made a big mistake."
The comments followed an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen, released on Saturday, where Obama was asked about the existence of extraterrestrial life. He responded, "They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada, which fringe theorists have long speculated holds alien bodies and crashed spacecraft. However, CIA archives released in 2013 identified it as a test site for top-secret spy planes.
Crucially, there was no indication in Obama's remarks that he relied on classified information for his assertion.
In a subsequent Instagram post on Sunday, Obama further clarified his position, stating, "I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!" He explained his belief in aliens stemmed from the statistical probability of life in a vast universe, while deeming visits to Earth unlikely due to distance.
When questioned on Thursday about his own knowledge of alien existence, Trump stated, "I don’t know if they’re real or not."
The White House declined to add to Trump's comments, and Obama's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In recent years, the Pentagon has intensified efforts to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects.
Senior military leaders confirmed in 2022 that they had found no evidence to suggest alien visits or crash landings on Earth. A 2024 Pentagon report further concluded that US government investigations since the end of World War Two have uncovered no evidence of extraterrestrial technology, attributing most sightings to misidentified ordinary objects and phenomena.

The US Department of Justice’s massive release of Epstein case files has turned some internet users into self-appointed digital sleuths. They’ve been combing through thousands of emails in search of hidden clues and have eventually fixated on one word: pizza. The term appears more than 900 times in the documents, prompting some Trump supporters to claim it vindicates Pizzagate. But the allegation that Democrats were running a Satanic child sex abuse ring out of a Washington D.C. pizzeria remains a conspiracy theory. In this episode of Truth or Fake, Maya-Anaïs Yataghène explains why.

Will Andrew and Epstein finally bring down the monarchy?

Opinion
Will Andrew and Epstein finally bring down the monarchy?
In a moment of dramatic irony, Prince Hamlet’s uncle Claudius, who has murdered his brother to usurp the throne of Denmark, hypocritically boasts that a divine protective force or barrier keeps monarchs like him from harm. “There’s such a divinity that protects a king.” For too long Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, King Charles’ disgraced younger brother, has been “hedged” by the British establishment from the consequences of his actions or possible misdeeds.
His arrest by police on his 66th birthday on suspicion of misconduct in public office removes one of the last of these protections. That is only right. One of the foundational principles of the rule of law is that government officials, politicians, and even princes, are not immune from legal consequences. There can be no exceptions to the legal maxim cited by British judges for centuries, “Be ye never so high, the law is above you.”
A charge or a court action does not automatically follow an arrest. Another foundational principle of the rule of law is the assumption of innocence unless proven guilty. But it does put Andrew on notice that he can no longer tell untruths about a relationship with Jeffrey Epstein that continued long after the financier was convicted and imprisoned for procuring a minor.
Release of the Epstein files in the US has shredded Andrew’s own airbrushed account of that friendship. It raises doubts about his credibility in a notorious BBC television interview where he denied having sex with Virginia Giuffre, a minor procured by Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. The consequences of legal perjury for Andrew would be dire.
Andrew’s cup of misery is overflowing. Allegations related to the Epstein files are that he forwarded confidential reports to the financier while he was a trade envoy for the UK. Police have been searching both his former home in Windsor and his new address in internal exile on the Royal Estate in Norfolk. Former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has also demanded that police investigate him as an accessory or witness to Epstein’s use of London’s Stansted and Luton airports to traffic women and girls.
I recently wrote that the flaws of Epstein’s other celebrity British pal – or rather prize catch – Peter Mandelson, were well known before his appointment as ambassador to Washington ended in an all too predictable scandal. Labour’s governing establishment, however, was determined to look the other way. Andrew’s vices have been hiding in plain sight for many years, too, and have been similarly ignored.
In my time working at The Sunday Times newspaper, we revealed in 2007 that an unknown Kazakh oligarch had bought the then prince’s former home of Sunninghill Park for £3 million ($4 million) above the asking price and an estimated £7 million more than the property’s market value. Made an official trade envoy by prime minister Tony Blair to indulge his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, Andrew had become patron of the British-Kazakh Society jointly with the country’s dictator, Nursultan Nazarbayev. The sale has been subsequently linked to a Kazakh money-laundering scheme, but at the time Andrew refused to make any inquiries into the cause of his good fortune.
Not long after that story appeared, I was invited to a dinner by a go-between to meet the then prince. This was one invitation that was easy to decline. Courtiers at Buckingham Palace, prime ministers and Foreign Office officials forced to work alongside Andrew in his trade envoy role were not so fastidious. Deference to his mother, an icon of respectability, lay at the heart of it. Who at the time was policing the border between Andrew’s official duties and his financial affairs? Now it is alleged that his access to foreign leaders and financiers may have helped Epstein, too.
Some mothers are blind to the faults of their children. Andrew was the late Queen’s favourite. When Giuffre sued him in a New York court, accusing him of sexual assault, the Queen provided £7 million ($13.35 million) towards his £12 million out-of-court settlement, topped up with £3 million from her husband’s estate. Andrew strenuously denied all the charges at the time and still does.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his own tenure of office in jeopardy after a series of scandalous appointments including that of Mandelson, is vulnerable to the accusation that he tolerates a “boys’ club” at No. 10. He won’t be providing any protection. Mountbatten-Windsor’s brother the King declares that “the law must take its course”. Can the monarchy survive the scandal?
The cynics will reply that the damage caused by Andrew to the royal family is catastrophic, but not serious. After all, the monarchy has been surviving scandals for decades, even centuries.
The memory of Queen Victoria’s “wicked uncles”, a notably bad lot of Regency rakes and scoundrels, was soon erased by her virtuous marriage to Prince Albert, a pillar of Germanic rectitude and intellectual high seriousness. Edward VII’s fondness for actresses and horses never did the institution much harm, and his grandson Edward VIII’s abdication in 1936 to marry an American divorcee preserved bourgeois propriety and yet gifted the world a glamorous royal love story. The collapse of Charles’ fairytale marriage to Princess Diana – which kept the glossy gossip mags in business for years – only enhanced the marketability of an institution called “The Firm” by royal insiders.
In every royal legend, Hamlet included, there has to be a wicked uncle who offsets the virtues of the good prince or princess. Andrew’s vices and those of his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, provide a perfect foil to the goody-two-shoes couple of his nephew William and wife Catherine, the Prince and Princess of Wales – or at least to their well-polished public image.
The great Victorian authority on the British constitution, Walter Bagehot, warned that exposure of the workings of the monarchy would let “daylight in on magic”. He didn’t foresee that the public’s hunger for a sacrificial Epstein villain might become an essential part of the performance.
Still, the cynics may have underestimated how this scandal trumps them all. We may hear more about Andrew’s unwise choice of company – allegedly including a Chinese spy – and the extent of his involvement in Epstein’s network at home and abroad. Unless he clears his name, the late Queen’s intervention in settling Andrew’s court case will increasingly look to the public like the payment of hush money. And you don’t have to be a moralist to worry that it took allegations about profiteering, not the cries of alleged victims, that brought Andrew to the attention of police.

Far more Americans believe Trump is racist than not, poll finds
The president has defended himself against claims of bigotry by pointing to his friendship with prominent Black figures
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Nearly twice as many Americans believe President Donald Trump is racist as believe he is not, according to a new survey, which comes after the president repeatedly rejected this allegation.
In the February poll from The Economist/YouGov, respondents were asked whether or not they would use the word racist to describe the 79-year-old Republican president.
Nearly half, 47 percent, said they would use this descriptor, while 24 percent said they would not — and 29 percent expressed no opinion.
Unsurprisingly, the results were sharply divided based on partisan affiliation, with 90 percent of Democrats, 48 percent of independents and just 5 percent of Republicans saying the term applied to the president.
The poll was conducted February 13-16 with 1,682 U.S. citizens, the vast majority of whom were registered voters. It had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.
On Tuesday, Trump used the death of Reverend Jesse Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader, to rebuff allegations of bigotry.
“Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The following day, the billionaire president again defended himself during a Black History Month event at the White House by citing his friendship with boxer Mike Tyson.
“Mike has been loyal to me,” he told a crowd of supporters at the executive mansion. “Whenever they come out, they say, ‘Trump’s a racist’ — You know, it’s like a statement: ‘Trump’s a racist’ — Mike Tyson goes, ‘He’s not a racist. He’s my friend.’”
His most recent remarks came about two weeks after a video portraying the Obamas as apes was posted to his Truth Social account, sparking bipartisan condemnation and calls of it being racist.
Senator Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, called it “the most racist” thing he had seen from the White House. Senator Rodger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, called it “totally unacceptable” and called on Trump to apologize.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially dismissed criticism of the clip, calling out “fake outrage.” Hours later, though, the video was taken down and a White House official blamed a staffer for posting it “erroneously.”

Trump mixes diplomacy and flattery at first Board of Peace meeting

WASHINGTON - World leaders who accepted the invitation of US President Donald Trump to join his new peace board
While the US president has been chummy with world leaders in the past, he has typically leaned in to a good-cop-bad-cop routine, alternating between praise and threats as his interests dictate. On Feb 19, those in attendance saw Mr Trump at his most convivial.
There was no hint of the criticised human-rights records of some attendees. It was only those who did not attend the inaugural meeting of the board in Washington who received an ominous warning: “You can't play cute with me,” Mr Trump said.
A number of key US allies have declined to join the forum set up by Mr Trump in September 2025 for Gaza reconstruction but which he hopes can become a global conflict-resolution body. Critics say it risks interfering with the work of the United Nations.
As leaders huddled for a group photo, the event’s soundtrack set the tone, as James Brown’s 1966 song It's a Man’s Man’s Man’s World blared overhead.
Gaza is the board’s first priority, but the Middle East conflict was not discussed in detail by Mr Trump until 25 minutes into his welcome speech, as he focused first on complimenting the world leaders on the event stage, rating some of them on their good looks, wealth and strength.
Mr Trump recited the names of the world leaders in attendance – as well as global football body FIFA’s President Gianni Infantino – who were all seated on both sides of him on stage, some with red MAGA hats in front of them on the table.
“President (Santiago) Pena of Paraguay is here,” Mr Trump said, pointing out the 47-year-old leader. “Young handsome guy. It's always nice to be young and handsome. Doesn’t mean we have to like you. I don’t like young, handsome men. Women I like. Men, I don't have any interest.”
Nonetheless, his interest in the male physique was apparent. At one point, he told the crowd to look at the “tough” face of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Mr Trump also told stories in which he portrayed himself as having coerced leaders into doing what he wanted. He told the crowd how he had used threats of tariffs to pressure some countries, such as India and Pakistan, into ending conflicts. India has firmly rejected this assertion.
‘Beautiful’ people
The president suggested that his new board could overtake the United Nations in prominence.
“The Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations... they need help,” Mr Trump said, digressing to recount his visit in 2025 when he and first lady Melania Trump were stuck on an escalator in the UN headquarters in New York.
“I was lucky my movie-star First Lady was in front of me, because I put my hand on a certain part of her body,” Mr Trump said of the escalator incident.
In total, the president used the term “beautiful” at least 14 times in his speech to praise his administration’s work and the event space, which was named after him.
He said it was Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s idea to “surprise” him by renaming the US Institute of Peace, where the event on Feb 19 was held, in his honor.
“I didn’t know the surprise,” Mr Trump said. “I thought maybe they were going to give me a lot of money or something, maybe cash.” REUTERS

Large Trump banner hung at justice department headquarters

A large banner featuring Donald Trump’s face was hung on the exterior of justice department headquarters on Thursday in a physical display of the president’s efforts to exert power over the law enforcement agency that once investigated him.
While Trump banners have been hung outside other agencies across Washington, the decision to place one on the storied justice department building amounted to a striking symbol of the erosion of the department’s tradition of independence from White House control.
The banner, hung between two columns on one corner of the building, says “Make America Safe Again” – a slogan used by the administration to tout its efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration and violent crime.
Pam Bondi, the attorney general, has postured herself as the president’s chief supporter and protector, eschewing the approach of predecessors who sought to maintain an arms-length distance from the White House to protect the impartiality of investigations and prosecutions.
Trump officials have rejected accusations that they have weaponized the justice department for political purposes, saying the Biden administration was the one that politicized law enforcement with two federal criminal cases against Trump that were abandoned after he won the 2024 election.
The department in a statement on Thursday said it was proud to “celebrate 250 years of our great country and our historic work to make America safe again at President Trump’s direction”.
The Trump administration has opened investigations into a number of the president’s perceived enemies, amplifying concerns that the agency is being used to exact revenge on his political foes.
Federal prosecutors brought charges against New York attorney general Letitia James and former FBI director James Comey that were later dismissed, and separately sought to indict several Democratic lawmakers in connection with a video in which they urged US military members to resist “illegal orders”.
The department is also investigating Fed chair Jerome Powell over congressional testimony and Democratic Minnesota officials over whether they obstructed federal immigration enforcement through public statements.

Alysa Liu wins gold for U.S. in women's figure skating at 2026 Winter Olympics
Alysa Liu won a gold medal in women's individual figure skating on Thursday, making her the first U.S. woman to take the Olympic podium in the event since 2006. Japan's Kaori Sakamoto took silver and Ami Nakai, also of Japan, took the bronze.
The last American woman to earn a medal in individual figure skating was Sasha Cohen, who took home silver in 2006. Sarah Hughes was the last American woman to take home a gold medal, in 2002 — four years before Liu was even born. Michelle Kwan also won a bronze medal at those Olympics. This is Liu's second gold medal.
"I just like, can't process this. There's no way," Liu could be heard telling her coaches as she walked down the hallway after winning.
Liu, 20, started the free skate in third place, behind Japan's Nakai and Sakamoto, following the short program on Tuesday. Isabeau Levito, 18, was in eighth place, while Amber Glenn, 26, was in 13th place after an error in her short program.
Glenn was the first U.S. skater to take the ice for her free skate. After failing to complete a triple loop on Tuesday, her score going into the free skate was 67.39. During Thursday's skate, she nailed a triple axel, though she had to catch herself with her hand after nearly falling during her final loop. She scored 147.52, for a total score of 214.91.
Photos captured Glenn embracing her coach after her skate. Glenn looked visibly thrilled, smiling and jumping for joy. Despite entering the free skate in 13th place, she was at the top of the leaderboard for much of the event, finally being unseated by Japanese skater Mone Chiba. Glenn ended the competition in fifth place, and Chiba took fourth place.
Liu praised Glenn's pop-scored comeback in a brief interview with an NBC Olympics correspondent.
"She did so good. I watched it on the bus on the way here, and aw, she killed it, and I'm really happy for her," Liu said.
Levito was the next American woman to skate. She took the ice with a score of 70.84 from her short program. She fell on the landing of her opening triple flip, losing nine points, but recovered to skate through the rest of her routine.
Levito looked disappointed after leaving the ice, even as Glenn cheered for her. She also appeared emotional as her score of 131.96 was read out. Levito racked up a total score of 202.80 and came in 12th overall.
Liu was the final U.S. competitor and the third-to-last skater to take the ice. She looked at ease during her warmup, waving to spectators as she rehearsed. She entered the rink with a score of 76.59 after her carefree short program. Liu looked casual and energetic during her free skate, sailing through a triple lutz and triple salchow. She had a broad smile on her face throughout the event, and the crowd roared every time she landed a jump.
Liu looked particularly at ease during her choreographic step sequences, and ended the routine triumphantly as her family rose for a standing ovation.
Liu's score was 150.20, for a total score of 226.79.
"That's what the f*** I'm talking about!" she shouted to the camera after finishing her skate. She bounced off the ice to hug her coaches and could be heard saying, "That was so great!" as they handed her her skate guards. Glenn and Liu were also seen hugging.
Sakamoto earned silver for her skate to a medley of Edith Piaf songs. She missed a triple jump, but otherwise skated cleanly, and embraced Liu after she came off the ice.
Nakai struggled with some of her jumps, but the high difficulty score of her routine meant she still took home the bronze medal. Liu and Nakai also hugged after Nakai's score was read out.
The United States also took gold in the team skating event earlier in the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Chinese scientists put quantum chaos in ‘slow motion’
Researchers have controlled a temporary stable phase in the system, offering a possible avenue for preserving quantum information

Why you can trust SCMP
Zhang Tongin Beijing
In a landmark achievement, Chinese scientists have directly observed and manipulated prethermalisation – a critical transitional state in quantum systems – using the 78-qubit “Chuang-tzu 2.0” superconducting processor.
This allows researchers to “tune” the speed of quantum decoherence, providing a vital tool for managing complex quantum environments.
If a quantum system is disturbed, it naturally returns to a balanced state. The energy and information within it spreads out until they are evenly distributed. It would be similar to nudging a pendulum: it swings for a while but eventually slows down and stops.

This is a major challenge for quantum computing, which relies on keeping information perfectly intact. If a quantum system changes too quickly, its computational results become difficult to save and retrieve. However, predicting how long this process takes or what affects it is beyond the power of existing classical computers.
In a study published in Nature on January 28, researchers from the Institute of Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences reported the first observation of a counterintuitive intermediate stage during this evolution. This stage is transient, relatively stable and, crucially, controllable, offering a possible avenue for preserving quantum information.

Fifth candidate fired from The Apprentice as Big Zuu makes guest appearance
Roxanne Hamedi, a pharmacist from Aberdeen, was fired for her poor branding decisions

The latest series of The Apprentice has seen its fifth candidate fired after a task focused on creating and marketing a bottled water brand.
Aberdeen pharmacist Roxanne Hamedi was dismissed by Lord Sugar, who held her accountable for her team's poor branding decisions.
As sub-team leader for the branding element, Hamedi expressed her disappointment, saying she felt "like my time was cut short".
The episode required candidates to sell their new water brands live on social media and produce an accompanying television advert.
Rapper Big Zuu also made a cameo, assisting in judging the candidates' work. Lord Sugar ultimately attributed the team's branding failures to Hamedi, resulting in her exit from the BBC business show.
She was in the firing line alongside team leader Conor Galvin and pharmaceutical sales specialist Rajan Gill, who was brought into the boardroom after a disastrous pitch.
Hamedi said: “It didn’t feel good to be fired, just because I didn’t think that I deserved to be.
“There was a lot going on that day and I feel like other people lacked accountability.”
Hamedi said she took on the role of sub-team leader because she “wanted to get out of my comfort zone and take that risk”.
She added: “I don’t regret being a sub-team lead, but I just feel like my time was cut short in the process.”
She said Galvin should have been fired instead, adding: “I feel like he did throw me under the bus because I was just an easy scapegoat.”
Asked if she would have done anything differently, Hamedi said: “I guess I could have fought more in the boardroom, you know, called Rajan out on his lack of input, or reminded Lord Sugar that I’d taken creative risks and didn’t hide in the background.
“But I didn’t want it to come down to begging or being the loudest or most apologetic person in the room. I stayed true to myself and that takes integrity.”
Hamedi would have expanded her business, a beauty brand specialising in combatting hair loss, if she had won the programme.
The winner of the latest series of The Apprentice will be awarded £250,000 of investment into their company and the opportunity to go into business with Lord Sugar.
The Apprentice returns on BBC One next Thursday at 9pm.

Trump weighs limited strike on Iran to force nuclear deal, report says

U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing a limited initial military strike against Iran in an effort to compel Tehran to accept his demands for a new nuclear agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday.
The report said the potential move is intended to increase pressure on Tehran to reach a deal without triggering a large-scale assault that could prompt a significant Iranian response.
Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper reported that if approved, the strike could take place within days and would target military or government sites. If Iran continues to reject Trump’s conditions for halting uranium enrichment, the United States could respond with broader attacks on regime facilities, potentially with the aim of toppling the government, according to the report.
One source told the Journal that Trump may escalate gradually, beginning with a limited operation before ordering more extensive strikes, until Iran dismantles its nuclear program or the regime collapses.
U.S. officials told the newspaper it remains unclear how seriously Trump is considering the option after weeks of discussions, even though senior aides have repeatedly presented it to him. In recent days, the discussions have increasingly focused on wider-ranging attacks, the report said.
American officials also said Trump has not yet decided whether to order any strike. Options under consideration range from a weeklong campaign designed to force regime change to a narrower wave of strikes targeting Iranian government and military facilities.
Some U.S. officials cautioned that such strikes could provoke retaliation from Iran, potentially drawing the United States into a broader war in the Middle East and endangering its regional allies.

More than 90 deaths this season: Are we seeing more avalanches?

More than 90 deaths this season: Are we seeing more avalanches?
It is not unusual for avalanches to be in the news in the northern hemisphere at this time of year, the height of the annual ski season.
But Tuesday's deadly incident in California, which took the lives of eight skiers and left one more unaccounted for, and the difficult situation in much of the Alps - where there have been more fatalities than usual this year - has put a spotlight on avalanches and how prepared winter sports enthusiasts should be for them.
The two situations would seem to be very different. California has been coming out of a so-called snow drought and experts do not consider the latest snowfall exceptional.
But droughts followed by intense snow can cause problems - the new snow is unable to bind to old snow underneath, which can either be very hard or non-existent, and therefore remains loose.
Europe, however, has seen two major storms in a week and a large amount of heavy snow combined with strong winds, leading to high avalanche warning levels across an unusually large part of the Alps. Three Britons were among dozens killed in incidents so far over the season.
One Alpine resort suggested that the current conditions could be the worst there this century.
Recent snows have also led to evacuations of several communities in Switzerland and northern Italy, as well as power outages and a train derailment at Goppenstein in the south-western Swiss canton of Valais.
But is there a connection between events in Europe and California?
Is climate change to blame?
Climate change might seem an obvious culprit for the unstable weather conditions that have brought them about.
"There is evidence that climate change will lead to sharper, more intense precipitation followed by long periods without," Simon Mason, senior scientist at SEI US, told the BBC.
This would seem to be the case in Europe, which has recently had several seasons with lower than average snowfall, and some dry periods in the early part of this season.
"However, since many factors control avalanche risk and precipitation is only one controlling influence, it is difficult to conclude how risks may evolve with future climate change," Mason said.
Climatologist Christoph Marthy told Swiss outlet SRF the current Alpine winter - with weather until recently dominated by high pressure and several long, dry periods - is exactly the opposite of a typical climate change winter.
Benjamin Zweifel, of the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, told the BBC the storms were "only one piece of the puzzle".
"The main challenge this winter was a very weak snowpack [an accumulation of snow that compresses and melts seasonally] with very persistent weak layers, caused by long periods without new snow and low temperatures," he said.
While global warming affects weather patterns, the temperature itself could also have a direct impact on avalanches. According to the US Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, wet snow avalanches - which are likely to become more frequent as temperatures rise - are dangerous, difficult to predict and relatively poorly understood compared with the dry snow equivalent.
"Wet snow avalanches are caused by weakening in the strength of the snowpack, often triggered by rain, abundant sunshine, or warm temperatures," the centre says in an article on wet snow avalanche research, adding their frequency was expected to increase with changing temperatures.
A 2021 research paper in the journal Frontiers in Physiology suggests wetter and warmer snow may also adversely affect a person's chances of surviving an avalanche, while thinner snow cover may increase the risk of blunt trauma injuries.
Broadly, there would seem to be four destabilising issues that are changing the dynamics of avalanches - switching between droughts and heavy precipitation, the precipitation itself, wetter snow and snow which is actually melting.
How are resorts mitigating the risk?
Blaise Agresti, a high-mountain guide at Chamonix, told France's Sud radio that there was another important factor in Europe's spike in avalanche deaths - the changing behaviour of skiers and higher levels of risk.
"People are increasingly practising off-piste skiing. Among skiers, 25% go off-piste," he said.
Way-marked pistes are generally protected by pre-emptive avalanche blasting, and their snow is flattened and compacted to further reduce the risk. If there is still a danger of avalanches, pistes can be closed off, as has happened during the recent warnings.
But while forecasting and blasting techniques have improved in recent years, it is not impossible for avalanches to hit pistes that have been declared safe. There is no such thing as zero risk, and it may be advisable to keep away from pistes beneath mountainsides covered with powdery-looking snow.
Sometimes resorts can detect a wider threat. The French resorts of Tignes and Val d'Isere even imposed a lockdown because of the avalanche threat, forcing residents and tourists to stay indoors.
In general, though, resorts will not prevent tourists from going off-piste so instead they offer advice. Another French resort, La Plagne, for instance, tells skiers to get information about conditions, make sure they have the necessary safety gear - avalanche transceiver, shovel and probe - know how to use them, and always go out with a professional guide and never alone.
The resort, which has one of the world's largest off-piste areas, holds weekly safety days in high season and has recently invested in a drone equipped with a thermal camera for use in avalanche detection and rescue operations.
Thomas Hager, a ski guide based in the Zell am See region in the Austrian Alps, told the BBC World Service's Outside Source programme that sometimes it was easy for snow sports enthusiasts to be complacent.
"Snow looks so calm. It's comparable to water," he said. "In an ocean you don't see undercurrents but local people know where the undercurrents are and where avalanches go off frequently. So please always talk with local people and listen to the avalanche forecast."
He also suggested it was vital to carry an air-bag, which is not required by law but could help keep avalanche victims close to the surface of the snow.
Though the recent spike in avalanche deaths in Europe is worrying, it is not exceptional - according to European Avalanche Warning Services, 95 have died so far this season, compared to 70 in the whole of 2024-24 and 87 in 2023-24. The 2020-21 season, when 131 died, and 2017-18, when the figure was 147, seem comparable.
Could it have been a lot worse?
But if you ask weather watchers about the situation, a different picture emerges. Meteo France's team in Bourg-Saint-Maurice near the Italian border, told the BBC the region went from below-average snowfall to "remarkable" above-average snowfall in under 10 days.
"Statistically speaking, we experience a situation like this once every eight years. This means a very significant avalanche risk," it said.
Meanwhile the Val d'Isere resort, in its Thursday weather bulletin, said a third wave of 30-50cm (12in-20in) of snow - after the two storms - would have to be taken very seriously and required "certain precautions".
"The situation has not been seen for a long time (perhaps since February 1999)," it added.
So have modern avalanche-warning systems and safety measures taken by resorts in recent years kept casualty figures down?
Benjamin Zweifel believes the situation could be a lot worse without these factors, and says he sees a "big effect", at least in Switzerland.
He notes, though, that France and Italy have both seen higher fatalities - 25 in each, compared to Switzerland's 13 - but says this could be linked to "even more challenging conditions" in the western and southern Alps.
The worst could be over, though. The weather is expected to improve from Friday, giving resorts the space to carry out more safety work and allowing the snowpack to settle.
However, sunny, south-facing slopes will lose some of their snow, potentially leading to greater risks for off-pisters.

MOSCOW, February 20. /TASS/. The Ukrainian army lost over 520,000 troops, and 6,700 tanks and combat vehicles along the engagement line in 2025, First Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces and head of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff Sergey Rudskoy said.
"Their (the Ukrainian army - TASS) losses in 2025 amounted to roughly 6,700 tanks and combat armored vehicles, as well as over 12,000 weapons and mortars, and more than 520,000 servicemen in terms of personnel," he told the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.
"Since the beginning of the special military operation, the Ukrainian army has lost over 1,5 million troops in total," Rudskoy added.

Nawrocki signs law introducing new rules for assistance to Ukrainian refugees
Under the signed document, the key provisions of the special law will be incorporated into the general law on granting protection to foreigners, Ukrinform reports, citing Polish Press Agency (PAP).
"My signature on this document shows that consistency in action makes sense. My pressure on this matter, including a previous veto, forced the government to revise the draft and introduce changes expected by many Poles and proposed by me," Nawrocki said in a video address regarding the signing and vetoing of several laws.
He emphasized that Warsaw continues to stand with Kyiv "in its fight against imperial Russia," and that in the first months of the war Poland "passed the test of solidarity like no other country."
At the same time, he added that he had promised to end the "stage of unconditional privileges" and that he had fulfilled this commitment today.
Nawrocki stated that the law he signed ends the emergency assistance framework and introduces systemic rules.
"I am signing this law with the conviction that it protects our public finances, organizes the system, and restores a sense of basic fairness," he said.
The so-called special assistance law, in force since 2022, had simplified residence and employment rules, as well as access to social benefits and education for Ukrainian war refugees. The new law repeals the system created under that act. Instead, a unified system of temporary protection for all foreigners will be introduced. Under this framework, the most important instruments of the previous law will be transferred to the legislation governing the protection of foreigners.

US removing guardrails from proposed Saudi nuclear deal, document says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump has told Congress he is pursuing a civil nuclear pact with Saudi Arabia that does not include non-proliferation safeguards the US has long said would ensure the kingdom does not develop nuclear weapons, according to a copy of the document sent to Congress and reviewed by Reuters.
Mr Trump, a Republican, and former president Joe Biden, a Democrat, have worked with Saudi Arabia on paths to building the first civil nuclear power plants for the kingdom.
The development comes amid fears of a new global nuclear arms race following the expiration earlier in February of the last strategic arms limitation treaty
Arms control groups and many Democrats and some leading Republicans – including Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he served in the Senate – have insisted that any agreement come with guardrails, including that Saudi Arabia not have the ability to enrich uranium or to reprocess spent nuclear fuel, potential pathways to weapons, demands also made by successive US administrations.
They also insist that Saudi Arabia agree to the so-called Additional Protocol that grants the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency broad and more intrusive oversight of a country’s nuclear activities, such as the power to carry out snap inspections at undeclared locations.
The Trump administration sent an initial report to leaders on some congressional committees in November, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, that it is required to send if it is not pursuing the Additional Protocol, the Arms Control Association (ACA), an advocacy group, said on Feb 19.
The report “raises concerns that the Trump administration has not carefully considered the proliferation risks posed by its proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia or the precedent this agreement may set”, Ms Kelsey Davenport, the head of non-proliferation policy for ACA, said in an article published on Feb 19.
Mr Trump’s report to Congress says that the draft US-Saudi pact on civil nuclear, known as a 123 Agreement, puts the US industry at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s civil nuclear development, ensuring nuclear-proliferation safeguards are in place.
The document, however, opens the way to Saudi Arabia also having an enrichment programme as it refers to “additional safeguards and verification measures to the most sensitive areas of potential nuclear cooperation” between the US and Saudi Arabia, including enrichment and reprocessing.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, has said that the kingdom would seek to develop nuclear weapons if regional rival Iran did so.
“If they get one, we have to get one,” the crown prince told Fox News in 2023, saying a weapon would be necessary “for security reasons, and for balancing power in the Middle East, but we don’t want to see that”.
The White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Congressional check
Ms Davenport said “It behooves Congress” to provide a check on the administration’s power to strike an agreement with the kingdom and “consider not just the implications for Saudi Arabia, but also the precedent that this deal will set, and vigorously examine the terms of the proposed 123 Agreement”.
The Trump administration could submit the 123 Agreement to Congress as soon as Feb 22, ACA said, as it has about 90 days after the report to Congress to send it. Unless both the Senate and the US House pass resolutions opposing the 123 Agreement within 90 days, it would go into effect and allow Saudi Arabia a civil nuclear programme. REUTERS

Trump claims Obama revealed classified information when he said aliens are real
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE - United States President Donald Trump on Feb 19 accused former President Barack Obama of disclosing classified information when he recently said that aliens were real, but Mr Trump did not cite any evidence to support the allegation.
“He took it out of classified information... He’s not supposed to be doing that,” Mr Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while travelling to Georgia. “He made a big mistake.”
During an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen released on Feb 14, Mr Obama was asked if aliens are real.
“They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in... Area 51. There's no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Mr Obama said.
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada that fringe theorists have speculated holds alien bodies and a crashed spaceship. CIA archives released in 2013 said it was a test site for top-secret spy planes.
There was no indication in his remarks that the former president relied on classified information.
“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Mr Obama said in an Instagram post on Feb 15.
In the post, Mr Obama explained his belief that aliens exist by saying the statistical odds of life beyond Earth were high because the universe is so vast. He added that the chances of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth were low given the distance.
On Feb 19, Mr Trump said “I don’t know if they’re real or not” when asked whether he had seen evidence that aliens exist.
The White House said it had nothing to add to the president’s comments. Mr Obama’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Pentagon in recent years undertook a push to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects, and senior military leaders said in 2022 they found no evidence to suggest that aliens have visited Earth or crash-landed here.
A 2024 Pentagon report said U.S. government investigations since the end of World War Two have found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology and most sightings were misidentified ordinary objects and phenomena. REUTERS

Groceries, water, art supplies: Israeli women ready families for another confrontation with Iran

As the world waits to see whether the Trump administration will carry out strikes against the Islamic regime following failed nuclear negotiations and a month of domestic unrest, Israeli women told The Jerusalem Post on Thursday that they are preparing themselves and their loved ones for the possibility of another confrontation with Tehran.
The 12 Day War in June, which significantly reduced elements of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure through targeted strikes, left a deep imprint not only on military calculations but on civilian life in Israel. During the fighting, the Post spoke with people who had lost their homes, pet owners whose animals did not survive the attacks, and reported on the deaths of 32 people in Israel, including 31 civilians, four of whom were children.
Keren Shannon, 39, said she felt that, as soon as the war ended in June, the conflict was not truly over. Since then, she has kept 18 bottles of water under her table, stocked up on cans of tuna and dried Quaker oats, purchased rechargeable lights, and secured 40 days' worth of food for her cat.
Preparing for a potential emergency, Shannon also bought a radio and a first-aid kit and placed a war bag by her front door containing “my medicine, passports, portable hard drive, charger, and a power brick.”
Shannon lives in Ramat Gan, the same city that saw an Iranian missile kill 76-year-old Aharon Mizrahi and 74-year-old Eti Cohen Engel in two separate impacts.
“I have a dress by my front door that is easy to throw on if a siren goes off while I'm showering [and] I have slip-on shoes by the door,” she added.
More Israeli women share how they prepare
For Sarah Levy, a 40-year-old mother living in Bat Yam, the concern is primarily for her son. She told the Post she felt torn about whether to fly to Germany to spare her four-year-old the experience of another war, but has instead begun preparing ways to keep him occupied in Israel, purchasing “a ton” of arts supplies.
Levy said she suspected another round of fighting would follow the truce in June and that she “didn’t feel safe in Israel anymore” after seeing ballistic missiles damage safe rooms in homes across the country.
“But I continue to live, continue to push through. I noticed I start to suppress bad news and take life day by day. There is no other way to live here and not go crazy,” she explained. “You have to close your emotions a bit to survive. Some would say you become stronger here, more resilient. I think we become numb. To danger. To violence. To the suffering of others. We cannot take it any more; it has been a rough few years.”
Asked whether she feared the long-term impact of war on her son, Levy said she worried it could shape his worldview in ways she hopes to avoid, including growing fearful of Arabs and Arabic. The issue is deeply important to her, she said, as she has consciously raised her son to focus on peace, including sending him to a Muslim metapelet (caregiver).
“How much influence will I have on the person he becomes? Will I be able to shield him from becoming a racist or someone whose political attitudes are fueled by Jewish supremacy and racism? Or someone who hates out of fear? Those were the thoughts that occupied my head and my heart throughout the war,” she told the Post.
For Beca Bookman, another war would mean adjusting to new responsibilities. Last month, the Jerusalem resident adopted a puppy and began preparing her own grab bag with essentials for both herself and her new pet.
She assembled the emergency bag on the night of January 14. Without a mamad (safe room) in her building, Bookman said she understands that time is critical when heading to the building’s miklat (bomb shelter).
“Pretty much everyone has their bag that they bring down with them [ready],” she told the Post. “We recently got a dog, and it was a new experience trying to think about what he would need in such a situation. I packed him a large container of food, a dog bowl and water, his vaccination record, a couple of potty pads because he's young, wipes, and a bone with the hopes I remember to grab whatever toy he's playing with at the time a siren might go off.”
KeepOlim's 24/7 support hotline
Susan Cohen, the director of the 24/7 Tikva emotional support hotline run by the NGO KeepOlim, confirmed to the Post that they had received an increased number of calls over the past few days in which people voiced concerns about an impending war.
“Our call handlers are reporting an increasing number of calls from Olim experiencing heightened anxiety, fear, and emotional distress, particularly from individuals who were traumatized during the previous war and are now finding that unresolved trauma is being reactivated by renewed uncertainty and threat,” Cohen confirmed.
“Alongside this surge in crisis calls, requests for Tikva’s low-cost therapy services are also increasing, as more Olim recognise the importance of ongoing therapeutic support to help them cope emotionally during this period of instability,” Cohen continued.
Cohen warned that the prolonged uncertainty and repeated exposure to fear could have a “serious impact on mental health, placing vulnerable individuals at increased risk.”
“As uncertainty grows, we are seeing how deeply past trauma is being reawakened for many Olim,” concluded Cohen. “Access to timely emotional support and ongoing therapy is not a luxury; it is essential to helping people remain stable, resilient, and safe during this extremely challenging time.”
Olim in need of immediate emotional support can contact Tikva’s 24/7 Emotional Support Line in Israel on 074-775-1433. Those seeking low-cost therapy can apply via KeepOlim.org, where confidential application forms are available.

Dead, 11-ton humpback whale washes up on California beach as officials warn locals to stay away: ‘It’s massive’
Officials say the whale’s carcass could shift unexpectedly in the surf

A dead, 11-ton humpback whale washed onto a popular beach in California this week, prompting officials to warn locals to stay away from its “massive” carcass.
A massive 29-foot whale carcass washed ashore on a bustling portion of Newport Beach, located about 45 miles south of Los Angeles, on Wednesday afternoon, a Pacific Marine Mammal Center spokesperson told The Independent Thursday.
The subadult whale weighs approximately 11 tons, or 23,000 pounds, the center said.
Dangerous ocean conditions and strong winds on Wednesday prevented crews from immediately removing the whale from the beach.
“The stormy ocean conditions and rising tide make the whale a public safety concern, as the large body could roll onto bystanders who are too close,” the Pacific Marine Mammal Center said in a statement.
In addition to being a safety concern, humpback whales are a protected species under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which requires the public to stay at least 100 yards or 300 feet away at all times.
“The salvage boat can’t even do it because the weather is still extreme out in the outer water, and it’s too dangerous to tow,” Newport Beach Lifeguard Chief Brian O’Rourke told the Orange County Register.
Officials hope higher tides and an upcoming storm system could pull the whale back out to sea. But if that does not happen, crews may need to cut the animal into sections to haul it away. “We’re working on a plan to dispose of it,” O’Rourke told the outlet. “For it to just decay on the beach would cause a lot of different problems.”
Authorities also warned the public to stay at least 200 feet away from the massive carcass, noting the whale’s body could shift unexpectedly in the surf.
“Just please stay away from it right now until we can get the salvage disposal of the whale underway,” O’Rourke said. “It’s massive; there could be some danger to the public, it’s rolling away from the surfline.”
“It could cause damage, even crush them,” he warned. “That’s a possibility in a dangerous situation.”
The cause of the whale’s death is currently unknown.
Staff with the Pacific Marine Mammal Center will do a preliminary assessment followed by a necropsy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesman Michael Milstein told the Orange County Register.
Plans to remove the whale remain up in the air as officials monitor ocean conditions and the weather.

Hamas allegedly asked Mansour Abbas to ensure Netanyahu's re-election ahead of October 7 - report

Hamas had allegedly unsuccessfully attempted to influence Ra’am head Mansour Abbas to join a government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2021, Israeli journalist Amit Segal reported on Thursday.
According to Segal, a senior Hamas official had called Ra'am leader Mansour Abbas from Qatar, allegedly demanding he aid Netanyahu retain the premiership.
The official reportedly believed that "Netanyahu was looking for continued calm and quiet understandings, while a new government would be dragged into an operation in the Gaza Strip."
Former prime minister Naftali Bennett then backed Segal's claim on X/Twitter, emphasizing that "this is not a claim made by political rivals, it is not a theory, these are the facts that Amit Segal has just exposed."
"The same senior Hamas official explicitly asked Abbas not to join Bennett, because they were afraid of a government led by me and knew it would not allow them to arm themselves and slaughter us, as they did on October 7."
Bennett invited Smotrich to 2021 gov't before Arab party
On Thursday, Bennett said he would not boycott National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir (Otzma Yehudit) and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party), according to leaked recordings released that day.
The comments sparked speculation that he would be willing to form a government with right-wing party leaders after the upcoming elections, scheduled to take place no later than October.
Regarding his term as prime minister that began in 2021, Bennett said he had invited Smotrich to join his government.
“If Smotrich had come, there would have been no need to rely on an Arab party,” he said. “But he preferred that I rely on an Arab party so that he could get angry about it, rather than come and be part of the solution. So, this boycott needs to be broken.”
Bennett became prime minister in June 2021 and entered a rotation government with opposition leader Yair Lapid (Yesh Atid). His government was the first in Israel’s history to include an Arab party.
It added the Ra’am Party to the coalition in a controversial move that is cited in the current round of elections.

WASHINGTON
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to rally support for an ongoing ceasefire in the besieged Gaza Strip, telling member states of President Donald Trump's Board of Peace that "there is no plan B."
"We have to get this right. There is no plan B for Gaza. Plan B is going back to war. No one here wants that," Rubio said as leaders and senior officials assembled for the board's inaugural meeting.
"Plan A, the only path forward, is one that rebuilds Gaza in a way of enduring and sustainable peace, where everyone can live there, side by side with one another, and never worry again about returning to conflict, to war, to human suffering and to destruction," he added.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. It has since expanded to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

UK public cheers ex-prince Andrew’s arrest, Trump calls it ‘very sad’
Britons say the arrest of the Epstein-linked brother of King Charles sends the message that the royal family is not above the law
Britain’s typically pro-royal public welcomed the arrest Thursday of the former prince Andrew, whose friendship with convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has turned him into an outcast.
Some appeared delighted that police were holding King Charles’ brother, arguing it sent the right message that the royal family was not above the law.
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, called the arrest “very sad” on Thursday.
“I think it’s a shame. I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
The former prince, who became the first senior British royal in modern history to be arrested, is accused of sharing sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, was later pictured slouched in the back of a vehicle on Thursday evening as he left Aylsham police station in Norfolk after being released under investigation.

Teens arrested over shooting of former NRL star, alleged attacks on son

Teens arrested over shooting of former NRL star, alleged attacks on son
Four teenagers, including a 16-year-old boy, have been arrested over a spate of violent incidents allegedly targeting former NRL star Matt Utai’s son Iziah, whom police say is at the centre of an escalating gangland conflict between an emerging Sydney gang and the notorious Alameddine crime family.
Detectives from the newly formed Strike Force Halesowen on Thursday raided six properties in Riverwood, Guildford, Lilyfield, Villawood and Auburn, arresting two 19-year-old men, an 18-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy over the shooting of Utai and the firebombing and shooting of homes linked to his 24-year-old son.
Matt Utai, a member of the Canterbury Bulldogs’ premiership-winning side in 2004, was shot outside his Greenacre home in a “brazen ambush” on Tuesday morning.
Detectives on Thursday charged a 16-year-old boy with being an accessory after the fact to the attempted murder of Utai, who was shot in the chest and leg as he walked to his car parked outside the home he shares with his wife and children about 6am. Detectives are yet to speak with the 44-year-old, who remains in a coma.
The boy was also charged with supplying a pistol to a person not authorised to possess it and participating in a criminal group. Police will allege he helped Utai’s shooter conceal the pistol used in the attack. He was refused bail to appear in a children’s court on Friday.
Detectives also charged a 19-year-old man who they allege drove the gunman, who is yet to be arrested, from Utai’s house after the shooting. He was charged with being an accessory after the fact to Utai’s attempted murder and participating in a criminal group. He was refused police bail to appear in Parramatta Local Court on Friday. The gunman is yet to be charged.
Detectives believe Utai was targeted because of his son’s alleged involvement with the self-proclaimed Coconut Cartel, a “violent criminal organisation” that has been engaged in an increasingly violent feud over control of Sydney’s lucrative drug market.
Less than 24 hours after his father was shot, Iziah Utai’s Guildford West home was set alight, while a St Clair property linked to him was sprayed with bullets.
A video circulated throughout Sydney’s underworld and published by SCN Worldstar shows a person setting the front of the Guildford West property alight.
“F--- him and the Coconut Cartel … this is the start of the destruction,” a person says in the video.
In December, several shots were fired at the same home. Two women and a child were inside at the time but were uninjured. Last May, Iziah Utai’s Merrylands barbershop was firebombed twice in two days.
Detectives on Thursday also arrested two men, aged 18 and 19, over the fire, charging both with damaging property and participating in a criminal group. The 18-year-old was granted conditional police bail to appear in Bankstown Local Court on March 10.
The 19-year-old was also charged with drug supply offences related to a kilogram of cocaine allegedly found at his Villawood home. He was refused police bail to appear in Bankstown Local Court on Friday.
No arrests have been made over the St Clair shooting. Video published by SCN Worldstar shows several shots being fired at the front of the Menzies Circuit home from a high-powered rifle.
Iziah Utai left Australia shortly after senior underworld figure Dawood Zakaria was killed in a botched assassination attempt on one of his associates in May, and is believed to be residing overseas. A warrant for Iziah Utai’s arrest in relation to Zakaria’s murder has been issued.
Police allegedly seized three vehicles, knuckle dusters, electronic devices and items of clothing during Thursday’s raids.
The Coconut Cartel has emerged as the main rival of the Alameddine crime family, which police have long alleged controls Sydney’s illicit drug market. The Coconut Cartel is believed to be comprised of young men, including many of Pacific Islander descent, who have defected from the Alameddine network as it has fractured over several years.
Utai’s shooting and the targeting of homes linked to his son marked the most significant escalation of the conflict and sparked the establishment of Strike Force Halesowen, a 100-strong police taskforce to quell the violent feud.
The conflict between the two groups has been escalating since the splintering of the Alameddine network after several senior members defected from the group to form their own rival crime syndicate.
The defections sparked a gangland war and a series of retaliatory shootings in which several people were injured or killed. Police have not publicly linked that conflict to the current feud between the Alameddine network and the Coconut Cartel.

Deal or war: Trump’s 10-day clock on Iran
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
21:40:44 UTC
06:40:44 KST

After a day and a half in which a U.S. strike on Iran appeared imminent, and following the Islamic Republic’s decision to close its airspace ahead of what it described as “extensive missile launches,” Washington sought to cool war tensions and made clear — at least publicly — that the door to a deal had not closed.
“Maybe we’re going to make a deal. You’re going to be finding out over the next 10 days,” U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday, at the height of the first gathering of the Board of Peace Council he established.
He said talks with Iran were “good,” but stressed that a “meaningful deal” must be reached. “It’s proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise bad things happen,” he said.
In what appeared to be an ultimatum to Tehran, Trump added: “Now, we may have to take it a step further — or we may not. Maybe we’re going to make a deal.”
Trump also emphasized his efforts to promote peace worldwide, saying, “There's nothing more important than peace, and there's nothing less expensive than peace. You know, when you go to wars, it costs you 100 times what it costs to make peace.”
Shortly afterward, Trump was asked about a deadline for Iran and replied, “I would think that would be enough time — 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”
'A beautiful armada' vs. diplomacy
But the American president’s remarks were received with considerable skepticism across the Middle East. In fact, the contrast between his words and the actions the United States — under his leadership — has taken could hardly be sharper.
On one side were smiles and handshakes at the inaugural session of the Board of Peace in Washington, where Trump announced billions of dollars in funding for Gaza’s reconstruction, praised the prime minister of Qatar and declared: “There's nothing more important than peace.”
On the other side was the largest U.S. military buildup seen in the region in years — the “beautiful armada” Trump dispatched, including hundreds of fighter jets, more than 10 warships, submarines and aircraft carriers, already positioned for offensive and defensive operations in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
Remarks made just a day earlier by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reflected the same dual message, even as she qualified her comments. “There are many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran,” she said, adding that “diplomacy is always [Trump's] first option.”
The planned visit next weekend by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also seen as a signal that strikes were not necessarily imminent. According to a State Department official, the purpose of the meeting is to update Netanyahu on U.S. negotiations with Iran, though that does not rule out military action beforehand.
In June of last year, during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, the United States joined strikes on Iran in the midst of ongoing talks and while awaiting Iranian responses, much as it is now.
In effect, Trump’s strategy in recent days appears to be one of extremes. At one end, he is offering Tehran a path to avoid powerful strikes if it agrees to his conditions for a deal. At the other, he is signaling the possibility of war, with all tools and full force.
“He is investing a great deal of time in thinking this through,” officials said, even as warnings circulated that the “window of opportunity may be closing.”
In the Middle East, winds of war still blow
Meanwhile, Israel is not waiting for Iran’s response in the negotiations. Despite concerns about miscalculation — reportedly a factor in postponing a meeting of the Security Cabinet — officials are preparing for a scenario of direct confrontation that would include missile launches from Iran toward Israeli territory.
In recent restricted discussions led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the working assumption has been that Iran would fire missiles at Israel even if the IDF does not participate in any U.S. strike. As a result, emergency services and the Home Front Command have been instructed to prepare for war. Various security agencies have declared their highest level of defensive alert, and the defense establishment is clearly on edge.
Netanyahu said Thursday that “alongside all the tremendous achievements, it is important to remember that the Middle East is at a crossroads. The extremists refuse to give up and are reorganizing to challenge us. We are prepared and alert to defend ourselves against any challenge, and we are operating in close coordination with our ally, the United States.”
Regarding the U.S.-Iran talks, he added: “I clarified to my friend Trump the principles that, in Israel’s view, must guide the negotiations with Iran. We are prepared for any scenario. If the ayatollahs attack, they will experience a response they cannot even imagine.”
Even before cooling messages emerged from U.S. officials, Israeli assessments Wednesday were that a decisive moment was approaching, with timelines shrinking to a matter of days. Two Israeli officials told CNN that Israel had raised its level of alert and accelerated military preparations amid “growing indications” of a possible joint U.S.-Israeli strike on Iran in the coming days.
According to one military source cited, Israel has sped up both its operational and defensive planning. If approved by Trump, the anticipated campaign “would go beyond the 12-day war and include coordinated strikes by the United States and Israel,” one source said.
In Iran, meanwhile, officials appeared unmoved by efforts to dial down tensions. Despite the massive U.S. naval and air forces positioned in the region, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei threatened to sink American aircraft carriers. At the same time, Iran has reinforced defenses around key regime facilities and is conducting military exercises.
According to assessments, Yemen’s Houthi rebels are expected to join the fighting immediately, launching missiles and drones toward Israel. There is also a credible scenario in which Hezbollah would not remain on the sidelines and, unlike during the 12-day war, would contribute to the confrontation this time.
The targets inside Iran
Between Washington’s cooling rhetoric and the winds of war blowing across the Middle East, President Trump appears to believe that the threat of military pressure could shift Iran’s defiant negotiating stance. If not, operational plans for large-scale strikes are likely already in place, with Israel and the United States closely coordinated. Drawing lessons from the 12-day war, senior officers from both countries reportedly spent weeks reviewing maps, aerial imagery and intelligence together.
The first and most urgent objective would likely be to cripple Iran’s air defense systems and establish air superiority — for Israeli forces and especially for U.S. aircraft. Another immediate target would be the ayatollah regime’s ballistic missile arsenal. Israel would prioritize destroying long-range missiles that threaten its territory, while the United States would focus on medium- and short-range missiles capable of targeting U.S. forces in the Gulf and regional allies. Washington would also almost certainly seek to dismantle Iran’s drone network, which could inflict damage on American assets.
Another key objective would be the naval forces of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which pose a threat to U.S. ships. Neutralizing that fleet would be essential if Washington aims to eliminate Iran’s ability to disrupt or close the Strait of Hormuz.
Israel’s goal would be to focus on defending against Iran and its proxies while preparing for potential action against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israeli planning is aimed at removing the missile threat once and for all.
It remains an open question whether Israel or the United States would use a strike to inflict further damage on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Another possibility is that one or both would attempt to target Iran’s so-called “missile cities,” underground tunnel complexes used to store and launch ballistic missiles.
Missile defense is another critical factor. Israel and the United States are likely coordinating closely on air defense and efforts to intercept ballistic missiles Iran may launch toward regional targets and Israel. One of Israel’s requests to Washington has been to bolster air defense systems.
Unlike the 12-day war, this time additional countries may assist Israel in intercepting missiles. In contrast to last year’s conflict, which Israel initiated, a broader confrontation could create incentives for neighboring states and European countries to participate in missile defense efforts.

Megan Keller's spectacular overtime strike earned the USA the Olympic women's ice hockey gold medal with a 2-1 win over defending champions Canada on Thursday, February 19. It was the first time the Americans have won the women's title since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
Keller skillfully deked a Canadian defender and beat goaltender Ann-Renee Desbiens just over four minutes into overtime. Her goal sparked huge celebrations on the Team USA bench and among the thousands of US fans in the Santagiulia Arena in Milan.
"I'm lost for words. This is an incredible feeling. I love these girls so much," Keller said. "This group deserves it. Just the effort and the faith that we kept through this four-year journey is something very special."
In a tight final, Canada struck first through Kristin O'Neill's backhander on a shorthanded play early in the second period, breaking the Americans' 351-minute shutout streak at these Games.
Just as the Canadians appeared to be heading to victory, Hilary Knight pulled the USA level with a shot from center ice to send the final into overtime. Her dramatic strike with just over two minutes left in regulation gave Knight a record of 15 goals scored at the Olympics by a US woman.
Keller ensured the USA didn't need the 20-minute overtime in operation for the Olympic finals as she used exquisite skill to win the game before being mobbed by her teammates as US head coach John Wroblewski wept with joy.
Earlier, Switzerland won the bronze medal by defeating Sweden 2-1.

WASHINGTON
The US is "grateful" to every member of President Donald Trump's Board of Peace for their participation, Vice President JD Vance said Thursday.
Vance said he believes the newly-created board is "fundamentally about making the peace stick, and it's an incredible thing that you guys have all done."
"To all of the leaders gathered here today who are investing in the future, who are investing in peace, we're grateful to you. We're grateful for your partnership," Vance said during the board's inaugural meeting in Washington, DC.
"In particular, I think, to the president of Azerbaijan and the prime minister of Armenia, who I just saw last week, thank you all for making it possible and for showing what real leadership can accomplish. When you set aside weapons and killing and destruction and invest in your people and invest in prosperity, it can create great things. So thank you both for what you did," he added.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. It has since expanded to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Tensions flare between France, Italy leaders over killing of French far-right activist
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - A war of words erupted between French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Feb 19 over the killing of a French far-right activist
Seven people, including an assistant to a member of parliament from the far-left France Unbowed (LFI), will face murder charges in the case, a prosecutor said on Feb 19. They were among 11 arrested
Ms Meloni, a conservative, said on social media on Feb 18 that the killing “by groups linked to left-wing extremism... is a wound for all of Europe.”
That triggered an angry response from Mr Macron on Feb 19, who told reporters during a visit to India: “I'm always struck by how people who are nationalists, who don’t want to be bothered in their own country, are always the first ones to comment on what's happening in other countries.”
Asked if his remarks referred to Ms Meloni, Mr Macron replied: “You got that right.”
Mr Macron, a pro-Europe centrist, and Ms Meloni, one of US President Donald Trump’s closest European allies, have sparred in the past over issues ranging from the conflict in Ukraine to trade and European policy.
The killing of Quentin Deranque, 23, during the Lyon clashes has caused uproar in France, damaging the LFI and allowing the far-right National Rally to depict itself as a victim of deadly extremist violence.
Lyon prosecutor Thierry Dran said Jacques-Elie Favrot, an assistant to LFI lawmaker Raphael Arnault, faces charges of complicity through instigation and was put in pre-trial detention.
Favrot and the other suspects deny the accusations, he added.
Mr Arnault said earlier this week that the aide had “stopped all parliamentary work”.
Favrot’s lawyer said his client has acknowledged committing violence and being present at the site, but said he was not “the author of the blows that caused the death of Mr Deranque.”
In response to Mr Macron’s criticism of Ms Meloni, the Italian Prime Minister’s office issued a statement expressing astonishment at the comments, saying Ms Meloni had “expressed her deep sorrow and dismay at the tragic killing of young Quentin Deranque.” REUTERS

Cherished teacher mourned following deadly crash with driver who was being pursued by ICE
Kindergarten and first grade students at a Georgia school are mourning their teacher days after she was killed by a driver who authorities say was fleeing federal immigration officers
- Bookmark
The kindergarten and first grade students in Linda Davis' classes sobbed and shed tears after being told their teacher, who greeted them most mornings with an infectious smile, wouldn't be coming back.
Davis, 52, was killed during her morning commute Monday, less than a half mile (0.8 kilometers) from the school where she taught students with special needs. Local and federal authorities say a Guatemalan man crashed his pickup truck into Davis’ car as he was fleeing a traffic stop by immigration officers.
“It was extremely difficult to tell 5 and 6 year olds that the teacher they loved and cherished will not be returning to see them,” said Alonna McMullen, principal of Herman W. Hesse K-8 School in Savannah's southside suburbs. “To see the looks on their faces, it broke my heart."
Teachers at Hesse were trying Thursday to create a normal routine for the students, but their grief remained fresh.
Many on their drives to and from school every day pass the crash site where a cross made from red roses and several bouquets of flowers have been left in the median. A paper sign on the ground reads: “Rest In Peace & Power, Dr. Davis.”
Students in Davis' two special education classes drew pictures of her to help deal with news of her death. And faculty crafted banners in her memory to display at the school's home basketball game Thursday.
‘A vacuum of compounded grief’
Davis began teaching at Hesse in September after the school year had begun. Her upbeat personality and her dedication to helping students with special needs thrive soon endeared her to fellow teachers and students alike.
“Even the most difficult students, she knew how to make them shine,” McMullen told reporters.
Davis had been teaching in the Savannah area since 2022. Outside of work, she was raising four children of her own and was guardian to a fifth, according to her sister, Felicia Jackson.
“The preventable, sudden, and violent loss of her presence and love has created a vacuum of compounded grief so vast it feels as though it fills the Mariana Trench,” Jackson said in a social media post.
Standing nearly 6 feet tall, Davis “filled her house with laughter and music,” Jackson said, recalling how her sister loved singing Disney songs and show tunes with her children “at the tops of their lungs.”
“That was Linda: fully alive, engaged, and loving,” Jackson wrote.
Local officials question whether ICE pursuit was necessary
Federal immigration officers have faced increased scrutiny for their aggressive tactics during the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration, especially since they shot and killed Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
Savannah Mayor Van Johnson and Chester Ellis, chairman of the Chatham County Board of Commissioners, have questioned whether the pursuit that ended in Davis' death was necessary.
A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, Lindsay Williams, said the fleeing driver had no criminal history but was in the U.S. illegally.
Security camera video from outside the school Monday morning shows a red pickup truck speeding past the school, followed several seconds later by two law enforcement vehicles with flashing lights.
Authorities identified the driver of the truck as Oscar Vasquez Lopez, 38. He suffered minor injuries, according to police, and has been jailed on charges including vehicular homicide and driving without a valid license.
ICE officers pulled over Lopez to enforce an immigration judge’s 2024 deportation order, Williams said, and Lopez drove away as the officers approached his vehicle. ICE said in a news release that Lopez crashed into Davis' car after making a U-turn and running a stop light.
“He is presumed innocent, and the court process will determine the outcome,” said Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Georgia Public Defender Council, which has an attorney representing Lopez.

Skiers stranded by California avalanche used iPhone SOS feature to seek help

California’s deadliest avalanche killed at least eight people in a ski group near Lake Tahoe on Tuesday. The six survivors used the iPhone’s emergency SOS feature to help first responders find them as they waited under a tarp and discovered some of the bodies, according to the Nevada county sheriff. Apple’s feature, introduced in 2022, allows users to text law enforcement, even if there’s no cell service or wifi by connecting the phone to a satellite.
First responders reached the skiers’ location and learned of the six survivors based on conversations held through the feature, Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a press conference on Wednesday.
California office of emergency services law enforcement chief Don O’Keefe said his staff spoke with one of the stranded guides for more than four hours to relay information to the sheriff’s office, which was leading rescue efforts. O’Keefe’s agency said in an emailed statement that this communication occurred through a personal locator beacon that had the ability to text; these compact devices also tap into satellite signals to allow communication in an emergency.
Law enforcement reported that a ninth person from the group of 15 is still missing, though presumed dead. Three were instructors with Blackbird Mountain Guides, and six were clients.
The iPhone’s emergency SOS feature is free for two years after purchasing an iPhone 14 or any later model and activating it. If a call to emergency services doesn’t go through, the smartphone links with a satellite and allows users to text relevant agencies. Onscreen instructions can guide a user on how to connect. Apple notes that users will have a better chance of doing so if they are “outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon”. Once connected, the iPhone shares key information with emergency responders, including Medical ID and emergency contact if that information is added before losing service, as well as location, including elevation and remaining battery life.
This isn’t the first time Apple’s emergency SOS feature has helped users in crisis. The tech has reportedly been used to help law enforcement rescue a man who suffered a serious ankle injury in a California forest, stranded hikers in Oregon and Colorado and two people who were in a car crash in Canada.

Apartment building damaged during Кussian offensive in spring 2022 restored in Bucha
According to Ukrinform, the head of the regional military administration, Mykola Kalashnyk, announced this on Telegram.
"The building, which suffered severe destruction due to shelling, has now been fully restored and put back into operation," Kalashnyk said.
At the beginning of the full-scale invasion, parts of the walls and floors were destroyed, the attic and roof were damaged, interior premises and utility networks were ruined, and windows and doors were blown out. In effect, part of the building had to be rebuilt from scratch.
"Today, children's voices can once again be heard in the renovated apartments, residents are arranging their homes and making plans for the future. This is the best proof that the community is being revived," Kalashnyk said.
He noted that it is symbolic that just yesterday a veteran support center, "Veteran PRO," was opened in the same building – a hub to assist servicemen and servicewomen and their families.
"Where the enemy tried to sow fear and destruction, a place of strength, mutual support, and new opportunities is now being created. In total, 3,189 residential properties were damaged in the Bucha community – 2,728 private houses and 461 apartment buildings. As of today, 2,055 private homes and 331 apartment buildings have already been restored. Work continues daily," Kalashnyk said.
He stressed that the community's reconstruction is the result of joint efforts by the state, regional authorities, local self-government, and international partners. Funding has come from state, regional, and local budgets, as well as donor support. It is a shared responsibility and a shared achievement.
"Bucha is one of the communities that suffered the most during the occupation. The memory of the tragic months of 2022 will remain forever. At the same time, the community is confidently recovering. Together, we are restoring not only buildings – we are returning people to normal life," Kalashnyk added.

Oxfam to halt Gaza aid over Israeli NGO Rules, as ex-CEO alleges pressure to say 'genocide'

Israel's Diaspora Affairs Ministry announced this week that the British-based NGO Oxfam will cease operations in Gaza after its Israeli registration lapses, part of a broader move affecting 37 international aid groups that refused to comply with new government data-sharing requirements.
The announcement came as the ministry also highlighted a recent interview on Britain's Channel 4 in which Oxfam's former CEO, Halima Begum, alleged the organization had disproportionately focused on the Israel-Gaza war and faced internal pressure to label it a genocide before sufficient legal review – claims Oxfam strongly denies.
Oxfam, which is comprised of 21 affiliates operating all over the world, was included on a list released in late December of organizations whose Israeli registration was set to lapse, meaning that they would have to halt their work in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The organizations listed, 37 in all, refused to comply with new registration requirements that went into effect on January 1, including providing the Israeli government with the personal information of their employees working in the Palestinian territories, many of whom are Palestinians themselves.
"INGOs cannot transfer sensitive personal data to a party to the conflict since this would breach humanitarian principles, duty of care and data protection obligations," a statement from Oxfam released in January read. "This is not a technical or administrative matter, but a deliberate policy choice with foreseeable consequences. If registrations are allowed to lapse, the Israeli government will obstruct humanitarian assistance at scale."
Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead in the Palestinian territories, explains that in Gaza, the organization does a lot of work on water and wastewater infrastructure. They "work with the local municipalities to deliver water, to provide technical support," she told Haaretz. They also work with the private sector and groups like the Palestinian Farmers Union.
The deregistration will not significantly upend their operations, she said. "We've known about this coming for the last year, so from our perspective, we've been kind of preparing for the last 12 months for how we're going to handle this."
Oxfam's method of having local partners lead in executing projects will help them survive. "But a lot of our peers do direct implementation and rely on direct implementation, and their activities will certainly cease if they have not already," she said of organizations that execute the projects by themselves.
"When journalists ask me, 'What are the implications of your organization's closure in Gaza?' I say, 'Well, okay, I guess people will be swimming in more sewage.' The bar is so low right now. The implications are terrible already," she said.
The question, Khalidi said, should not be what will happen to organizations that are deregistered, but what could happen if they were to be allowed to work unhindered. "I'd love to imagine a world where actually we could operate in Gaza without our operations getting attacked by Israel, our convoys not getting bombed, our colleagues not getting killed, our items not rejected and just blocked at the crossing … What would that do to the population of Gaza?"
The Diaspora Ministry, in the same statement, pivoted to highlight another controversy regarding Oxfam. "On a separate but related note," it read, before discussing a recent interview given by the organization's former CEO, Dr. Halima Begum.
The interview was given by the organization's former CEO, Halima Begum, to the United Kingdom's Channel 4. Begum alleged that Oxfam paid disproportionate attention to the Israel-Gaza war and pushed to brand it a genocide before receiving evidence or proper legal counsel.
Begum told Channel 4 that "It's important to obviously work around the rule of law and maintain that the international rule of law must not be compromised, but we have to show consistency with other crises that are taking place in the world, and it always felt as though we were disproportionately working around the crisis in Gaza."
"But other examples include quite strong push back when we were not ready yet to use the word 'genocide'" in relation to Gaza, "because to use the word genocide, it has to be something that we arrive at with consultation and evidence and good legal advice. To try and use that term before we're ready as an organization feels quite risky to me."
The statement quoted Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli as stating, "Dr. Begum herself, who is Muslim, has been a vocal critic of the State of Israel. Therefore, when she testifies about the level of antisemitism within the organization and levels these accusations herself, her remarks should resonate around the world all the more."
Oxfam denied Begum's accusations. In response to the interview, Oxfam said: "The claims made in the broadcast represent one individual's perspective and are strongly disputed by Oxfam Great Britain as unsubstantiated and inaccurate," it read. "We have a zero-tolerance approach to discrimination, harassment and abuse of power in all areas of our work – including racism, antisemitism, sexism and homophobia. These standards apply across the delivery of our programs worldwide."
It added that its institutional position on Israel and the Palestinian territories "has been clear and consistent for decades," and that the decision to use the word "genocide" was made "only after a thorough legal review and following widespread research and consideration of credible analysis by organizations and experts mandated to make such legal verdicts such as the International Court of Justice, the UN Commission of Inquiry and Amnesty International."

Opinion | It’s time for global governance to reflect the new realities
Despite international tensions, countries still seek cooperation based on shared interests. Institutions must embrace this trend
However, that order was designed for a world shaped by bipolar rivalry and later sustained by American predominance. Today’s global system looks very different: economically diffuse, environmentally constrained and politically fragmented but deeply interconnected by both trade and technology.
Meanwhile, rising populism in Western countries seeks to tear down multilateral structures perceived as holding back national prosperity.
Yet multilateral institutions remain anchored in yesterday’s distribution of power, while today’s challenges – climate change, digital fragmentation, supply-chain insecurity, debt distress and geopolitical rivalry – demand frameworks that reflect contemporary realities. Global governance has struggled to keep pace with these changes.
That old architecture was built for a world of steel, grain and territorial sovereignty. The system now finds itself confronting problems driven by data flows, artificial intelligence, cross-border platforms, atmospheric physics and globally integrated capital markets. Governance remains predominantly state-centric, while value creation and systemic risk increasingly transcend borders and sectors.

Elderly couple found dead at Dutch holiday park in suspected suicide
Municipality says couple had been in contact with authorities over residency rules at holiday park
ISTANBUL
The bodies of an elderly couple, believed to have died by suicide, were found at a holiday park in the southeastern Netherlands, local authorities said Thursday.
Emergency services responded to an alert at around 2.30 pm local time at the Posterbos holiday park in Posterholt, near the city of Roermond, where they found two bodies near a pond, one in the water and the other at the water’s edge, Dutch news broadcaster NOS reported.
Police later examined the couple’s home and quickly determined that “no foul play had taken place.”
Regional broadcaster L1 Nieuws also reported that the victims were a German couple, both over 80, who had lived at the park for decades.
Roerdalen Mayor Monique de Boer-Van Agtmaal said the pair had been undergoing a municipal “care process” because they were living permanently at the holiday park, which is not permitted under local regulations.
She noted there had been “positive contact” with them about a week and a half before the incident.
“They were in need of help and were open to the assistance we offered,” the mayor said, adding that it will likely never be clear whether there is any link between the suspected suicide and the municipality’s strict enforcement policy on permanent residence.
Authorities in Roerdalen have stepped up monitoring of holiday parks and warned residents that stays are limited to six months. Those exceeding the limit may face fines of up to €30,000 (approximately $35,000) and enforcement measures.
Officials said the investigation is ongoing, though emergency services are treating the case as a suicide.

Keller seizes gold for US women's ice hockey team in stunning overtime goal
Megan Keller on Thursday won gold for the US's Olympic women's ice hockey team with a strike just over four minutes into overtime to seal a 2-1 victory over defending champions Canada.
Megan Keller captured gold for the US's Olympic women's ice hockey team with a stunning overtime strike to seal a 2-1 victory over defending champions Canada on Thursday.
It was the first time the Americans have won the women's title since the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
Keller skilfully deked a Canadian defender and beat goaltender Ann-Renee Desbiens just over four minutes into overtime.
Her goal sparked huge celebrations on the Team US bench and among the thousands of US fans in the Santagiulia Arena in Milan.
"I'm lost for words. This is an incredible feeling. I love these girls so much," Keller said. "This group deserves it. Just the effort and the faith that we kept through this four-year journey is something very special."
In a tight final, Canada struck first through Kristin O'Neill's backhander on a shorthanded play early in the second period, breaking the Americans' 351-minute shutout streak at these Games.

Just as the Canadians appeared to be heading to victory, Hilary Knight pulled the USA level with a shot from centre ice to send the final into overtime.
Her dramatic strike with just over two minutes left in regulation gave Knight a record of 15 goals scored at Olympics by a US woman.
Keller ensured the USA didn't need the 20-minute overtime in operation for Olympic finals as she used exquisite skill to win the game before being mobbed by her teammates as US head coach John Wroblewski wept with joy.
The Americans have now won three of the eight titles since women's ice hockey entered the Games in 1998, with Canada winning the other five.
Earlier, Switzerland won the bronze medal by defeating Sweden 2-1.

The Mets will have a Bobby Valentine Disguise Night and hand out 15,000 fake mustache-glasses
Bobby Valentine won't necessarily be behind the sunglasses and fake mustache at Citi Field this summer
- Bookmark
That won't necessarily be Bobby Valentine behind the sunglasses and fake mustache at Citi Field this summer.
Among several promotions the New York Mets announced Thursday is a Bobby Valentine Disguise Night on May 29, inspired by what the former manager donned to return to the dugout after being ejected from a game in 1999. The giveaway for the first 15,000 fans will be a glasses-mustaches getup similar to what was worn by Valentine.
“I love it!,” Valentine wrote in a text to The Associated Press about the planned giveaway.
While Valentine went 536-467 as the Mets manager from 1996-2002, and helped guide them to the 2000 World Series, he is perhaps best remembered for the dugout disguise. The now 75-year-old former manager has even played into that over the years.
When Valentine was introduced during a Mets' Old-Timers' Day in 2022, he came out donning a fake mustache, drawing a loud chuckle from the crowd at Citi Field.
During a television broadcast of a Mets game at the Los Angeles Angels in 2024, Valentine did an in-game interview in the Angels booth wearing a disguise.
It was on June 9, 1999, that the excitable Valentine was ejected from a game against the Toronto Blue Jays. He was tossed in the 12th inning, but returned to the dugout with the fake mustache fashioned from eye black and sunglasses for the rest of the 4 1/2-hour game that the Mets won in 14 innings.
Valentine was later suspended for two games and fined $5,000 for the stunt.

New York governor pulls robotaxi expansion proposal for cities outside Big Apple

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, has pulled her proposal to allow commercial robotaxi services in smaller cities outside New York City, a spokesperson for the governor said on Thursday.
“Based on conversations with stakeholders, including in the legislature, it was clear that the support was not there to advance this proposal,” the spokesperson said.
The move comes as a setback to Alphabet’s Waymo, which received its first permit to begin testing its autonomous vehicles in New York City last year, albeit with a trained specialist behind the wheel. The permit is still in place, and Waymo’s plans for New York City are still likely to move ahead, as Hochul’s rescinded proposal governed areas outside the Big Apple.
The Alphabet subsidiary, which offers paid driverless rides to the public in cities in the San Francisco Bay Area, along with parts of Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, Atlanta and other cities, was hoping to grow its already sizable foothold in the robotaxi market and tap into a large pool of new users.
“While we are disappointed by the governor’s decision, we’re committed to bringing our service to New York and will work with the state legislature to advance this issue,” a Waymo spokesperson said. “We hear from thousands of New Yorkers who have experienced Waymo in other cities and want access to it at home.”
Self-driving operations already face a difficult path to commercialization, as the technology has been under heavy scrutiny over safety concerns after accidents, though Waymo’s safety record has not recorded major injuries like General Motors’ Cruise, which shut down after one of its cars dragged a woman through an intersection in San Francisco.
“Autonomous vehicles are already driving down accident rates and improving pedestrian safety in Arizona, California and Texas. It’s disappointing that Governor Hochul is withdrawing her proposal, because New Yorkers deserve the same proven protections,” Chamber of Progress’s CEO, Adam Kovacevich, said.

Anti-monarchist details what police detention could have been like for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor
An anti-monarchist has given an insight into what Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s time in police detention could look like after he was detained on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was detained at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on Thursday (19 February).
Speaking to The Independent, Graham Smith, CEO of Republic, said he hoped the former prince would be held in a cell when not being questioned, rather than “sitting in the constable’s office having tea”.
Mr Smith, who was detained by the Metropolitan Police on the morning of King Charles’s Coronation, described his own experience as “pretty grim”.“Not because I wish that experience on him,” he said, “but I would hope that he would be treated the same.”
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has routinely denied any wrongdoing in relation to his connections to Epstein.

King Charles’ brother Andrew released after arrest over misconduct relating to Epstein

AYLSHAM, Norfolk - King Charles’ younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was released from police custody on the evening of Feb 19 after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Feb 19, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police.
Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations
The arrest of the senior royal,
“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement.
A Reuters witness saw Prince Andrew leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT (3am on Feb 20 in Singapore).
A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken.
Thames Valley Police said later on Feb 19 that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.”
‘Law must take its course’
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement.
“Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.”
The king visited a fashion show in London
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than three million pages of documents
Those files suggested Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment.
He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged.
“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours in October 2025
Unmarked police cars
Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothed officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mr Mountbatten-Windsor now resides.
Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king’s Windsor estate where Mr Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deal with the most serious criminal offences.
Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a “common law” offence and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”.
Giuffre lawsuit
In 2022, the king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
“Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide in 2025, said in a statement.
In response to Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.”
“I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Mr Trump told reporters. “It’s very, very sad to me... to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.”
Were Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences.
His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mr Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.
US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the US over what he knew about Epstein.
Meanwhile, former British prime minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
Essex Police said on Feb 18 they were looking into the issue.

The King and the PM are right – no one should be above the law
Editorial: The royal family has acted with conviction, but King Charles and Prince William will need to do more to pressure Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to cooperate with the American Congressional investigation into Epstein
- Bookmark
Seismic” is a word that is easily overused, but it seems entirely appropriate in the case of the arrest of the former Prince Andrew and its consequences for the British monarchy.
Whatever Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor may have done – and the accusations are very serious – he is by now too peripheral a figure to bring down the dynasty. But equally, the monarchy cannot occupy its position based on divine right or class-based deference. It must earn its position by being useful.
The conduct of one individual ought not to affect the viability of the UK’s constitutional monarchy, but the family is linked to it, and public opinion can be capricious.
Even before this latest dramatic turn of events, serious questions were rightly being raised once again about the royal family’s finances, their tax affairs, and the size of “the Firm”, including the roles of the more marginal individual members. The Andrew affair, as we may well call it, is an unwelcome challenge to the system's propriety and transparency. The King and the Prince of Wales, in particular, will need to make changes in order to reassure the public that such behaviour will never be tolerated again. If that aspect is not taken care of, the institution will remain destabilised.
The blow to the prestige of the House of Windsor from the Epstein scandal is clearly grievous, as it has been for some years. The infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with the then Prince Andrew was a turning point for him and his family; his excuses, his unlikely claims, and his strange justification that he was, if anything, too honourable, only made matters worse. The saga is not over. All concerned must be conscious that there may be much worse to come, as the shocks from the millions of Epstein files continue to reverberate through the British body politic.
It is difficult to see any close precedent for these events in the modern age. British royalty is such an ancient fixture that it has seen pretty much everything: beheadings and other executions, forced and voluntary abdications, coups, murders, incarceration of inconvenient relatives, a king rendered deranged by some indeterminate disease, a few outrageous libertines, and routine eccentric behaviour.
The monarchy even had to be restored after an unhappy experiment with a republic in the 17th century. It seems to be an inevitable feature of British life, despite its tribulations.
The closest precedent to the events of the present day, in terms of the scale and depth of public concern, was the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997 – something that the then Prince of Wales, now the King, will remember very well. It was at that time that any notion of the Windsors as a model of family life to be looked up to was decisively shredded.
Also in 1997, Queen Elizabeth reflected that a hereditary monarchy could only exist in the modern era with the “support and consent of the people”. That should never be taken for granted. The monarchy has a constitutional role, and the family bolsters that through its charitable work and public appearances. That is a formula that should not be abused by way of entitlement or extravagance.
Some immediate issues have already been addressed. The former Prince Andrew is being treated like anyone else accused of a crime – nobody should be above the law, as the prime minister has said.
The King was given no special notice of his brother’s impending arrest, and has followed the correct constitutional line, promising to support the “full, fair and proper process”. He has removed all of his brother’s remaining titles and honours, and his royal status – though it took too long – to better quarantine the institution from collateral damage. He has, in short, put duty before family, and has proved ruthless in doing so.
Every occupant of the British throne faces fresh challenges, and each must rise to them as they judge best, and on the advice of their prime ministers and those closest to them. King Charles and Prince William will need to do more to pressure Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to cooperate with the US congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, and to give a full account to the British police looking into the movement of individuals into the UK on Epstein’s private jet. A more convincing statement of apology to the victims must also be put forward.
Misconduct in public office is a serious offence, but there could be even more gruesome problems to deal with in the coming months. Nothing can be done about that, but the King can make clear his distress about what’s gone on, keep his brother far away from the royal family’s work, and implement the reforms the public desires as soon as possible. If these tasks are accomplished, then he might leave the institution in sounder condition than it was in when he inherited it, little more than three tumultuous years ago.

New Mexico’s promise of free child care comes with a fiscal escape hatch

New Mexico’s promise of free child care comes with a fiscal escape hatch
An ambitious program to provide free universal child care to working families in New Mexico is being enshrined into law
- Bookmark
An ambitious universal child care program aimed at fully footing the bill for working families across New Mexico is being enshrined into law, with state legislators making good on promises by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to make the state the first in the nation to offer such a program to families of all income levels.
As parents across the nation grapple with crippling daycare bills that threaten to keep them at home and out of the workforce, political leaders from New York to San Francisco have been angling to expand access to free and subsidized care. The political stakes are high as the potential for budget uncertainties and fraud looms large.
California has opted to eliminate copayments for some families, while Washington and Oregon cap what families pay. In Vermont, a payroll tax on employers funds child care subsidies.
In New Mexico, the plan relies heavily on the financial windfall from oil and gas production — including earnings from a recently minted $10 billion trust fund for early childhood education. It's a delicate balance for a progressive governor who initially set out to rein in the industry.
Lujan Grisham wraps up her tenure next year, and state lawmakers wary of unchecked spending opted during the legislative session that ended Thursday to take a cautious approach. They're leaving the door open to copayments if public finances deteriorate. That's a compromise Lujan Grisham had to make.
Putting up guardrails
As much as $700 million more will be funneled over the next five years to New Mexico's child care assistance program, state officials said. Copayments are unlikely and would require 90-days notice to families.
Decisions on possible cost-sharing will be tied to new annual reporting requirements. The early education agency has new authority to monitor how much child care providers pay employees, manage debt and structure their businesses.
State Sen. George Muñoz, cosponsor of the bill, said the Legislature seized an opportunity to put guardrails in place.
“We didn’t want to end up like Minnesota, where all of the sudden there was rampant fraud,” he said, referring to allegations by U.S. prosecutors that billions in federal funds were stolen from Minnesota-run programs for children with autism, addiction services and more.
Taking the weight off families
Families stand to benefit enormously, Muñoz said, explaining free care will put money back in their pockets.
Marianna Eanone of Las Cruces said her income combined with her husband's Army salary was just above the previous cutoff for child care assistance. They used to pay $1,000 a month to send their 3-year-old to a licensed home daycare provider, along with afterschool care for their kindergartener.
“It’s been a weight off to not have to worry about that,” said Eanone, who works for a program that connects families with child development services.
There's now wiggle room to afford things like occasional takeout from local restaurants, martial arts classes for her 6-year-old, bigger payments toward student loan debt and savings for the future, she said.
And those benefits resonate with voters.
“They are sending a really strong signal about the importance of child care to the well-being of the families in the state, the well being of the economy, of businesses,” said Karen Schulman, senior director of child care policy for the National Women’s Law Center.
Prioritizing vulnerable children
The New Mexico legislation allows the state to create a waitlist when demand for assistance outpaces available slots. It's an effort to prioritize access for children in vulnerable circumstances — ranging from extreme poverty to disabilities and those at risk of developmental delays.
It's also a response to concerns that the rapid expansion of child care subsidies to all income brackets may squeeze out slots for low-income families. Attendance from low-income families declined as assistance expanded to higher income brackets, according to a review by legislative analysts.
Elizabeth Groginsky, secretary of New Mexico’s early childhood education department, said lawmakers also left financial breathing room for recently adopted incentives to improve child care quality, raise base wages and expand operating hours through enhanced rates paid by the state.
Still, child care slots remain in short supply across wide swaths of New Mexico, even as the state extends assistance beyond working parents to grandparent guardians, foster parents and people experiencing homelessness.
Legislators have sent a separate bill to the governor to scale up more home-based daycare and child care centers in residential areas by overriding some local zoning and permitting requirements, including homeowner association restrictions on child care.

Amazon can be sued over suicides linked to chemical sold on its website, court rules
The justices rejected a lower court's ruling that the families could not pursue negligence claims
- Bookmark
Amazon must face lawsuits by families that lost relatives who died by suicide after consuming a chemical bought from outside vendors on the retailer's website, the Washington Supreme Court ruled.
On Thursday, all nine justices rejected a ruling by an intermediate-level appeals court that the families could not sue Amazon for negligence because suicide was a superseding cause of their relatives' deaths.
Justice G. Helen Whitener wrote that Amazon owed customers a duty of reasonable care, and must avoid exposing them to "harm from the foreseeable conduct of a third party."
She said a jury should decide whether suicide was a foreseeable result of the Seattle-based retailer's alleged failure to exercise that duty.
Amazon defends safety commitment
Twenty-eight families have filed lawsuits alleging that Amazon has known for years about the link between the chemical and suicide yet continued to allow unrestricted sales, alongside other products that could assist in suicides. They have labeled these products collectively as "suicide kits."
The families are seeking unspecified damages from Amazon under a Washington state product liability law for their relatives' deaths.
Thursday's decision covered appeals by four of the families, who said they lost relatives ages 17 to 27 who consumed the chemical in 2020 and 2021.
Amazon said it disagreed with the decision and is committed to the safety of all its customers. It expressed condolences to families affected by suicide.
Used as a food preservative
The case is one of many seeking to hold online sales platforms such as Amazon responsible for products sold by third-party vendors.
"Amazon is one of the world's biggest companies, and shouldn't be profiting from products they know people use to harm themselves," Carrie Goldberg, a lawyer for the families, said in an interview.
The chemical linked to the suicides is often used as a preservative in foods, such as meat and fish. It also can be used in research laboratories, and in the treatment of cyanide poisoning.
In its statement, Amazon said the chemical "is not intended for direct consumption, and unfortunately, like many products, it can be misused."
Amazon said it now prohibits sales of the chemical with purity levels above 10%.

New Mexico reopens investigation into alleged illegal activity at Epstein's former Zorro Ranch

New Mexico’s attorney general has reopened an investigation into allegations of illegal activity at Jeffrey Epstein’s former Zorro Ranch.
Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s office made the announcement Thursday, saying the decision was made after reviewing information recently released by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Although New Mexico’s initial case was closed in 2019 at the request of federal prosecutors in New York, state prosecutors say now that “revelations outlined in the previously sealed FBI files warrant further examination.”
The New Mexico Department of Justice said special agents and prosecutors at the agency will be seeking immediate access to the complete, unredacted federal case file and intend to work with other law enforcement partners as well as a new truth commission established by state lawmakers to look into activities at the ranch.
“As with any potential criminal matter, we will follow the facts wherever they lead, carefully evaluate jurisdictional considerations, and take appropriate investigative action, including the collection and preservation of any relevant evidence that remains available,” the New Mexico Department of Justice said in a statement.

We need to focus on a minute and 15 seconds from Roni Koban's Kan 11 program "Encounter," which aired earlier this month. The interviewee was Gadi Eisenkot, head of the new Yashar party, and 12 minutes and 32 seconds into the show, he was asked about certain personality traits that are perceived as problematic for someone aspiring to be a successful politician. The dialogue is fascinating because it encapsulates the political and ethical vertigo in which we have existed for years, and which has become a kind of axiom.

White House pressure leads universities to cut ties with nonprofit that helps racial minorities
The Trump administration says that 31 universities have agreed to cut ties with a nonprofit that helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees
- Bookmark
The Trump administration said Thursday its campaign to end diversity programs in higher education has led dozens of universities to cut ties with an organization known as The PhD Project, which helps racial minorities earn doctorate degrees.
The PhD Project was a little-known nonprofit group until it caught the attention of conservative strategists last year and became the focus of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education. The Republican administration says school diversity programs often exclude white and Asian American students.
The investigation, opened in March 2025, has resulted in 31 universities agreeing to end partnerships with the group, the department’s Office for Civil Rights said Thursday. Negotiations are continuing with 14 additional schools, it said.
The department said in its statement that The PhD Project “unlawfully limits eligibility based on the race of participants” and that institutions partnering with it violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in education programs and activities that receive federal money.
“This is the Trump effect in action: institutions of higher education are agreeing to cut ties with discriminatory organizations, recommitting themselves to abiding by federal law, and restoring equality of opportunity on campuses across the nation,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said.
Many of the schools promptly cut ties with The PhD Project after the investigation was opened, in order to avoid entanglements with the administration. It had undertaken the inquiries after warning schools they could lose federal money over “race-based preferences.”
The PhD Project is one of many nonprofits that helps underrepresented groups gain access to higher education.
“The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today,” the organization said in a statement Thursday. The website says it has “helped more than 1,500 members earn their doctoral degree.”
The group of 31 colleges listed by the department included major public research universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and the University of Michigan, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
MIT, like many of the schools cited in the investigation, had paid The PhD Project “a nominal fee” to participate in the group's university fairs or conferences, allowing MIT to send representatives to answer questions about attending their school, spokesperson Kimberly Allen said.
MIT informed the government in April 2025 it had ended its participation in such conferences and was notified months later that the Office for Civil Rights had found it in violation of Title VI. The school signed a “resolution agreement” with the department about a week ago to resolve the matter “but explicitly did not admit any liability, wrongdoing or violation of any law or regulation,” Allen said.
The University of North Dakota said it, too, promptly ended its membership with The PhD Project two weeks after the investigation was announced last year.
“The University became a member of the PhD Project to have access to the PhD Project’s member directory and applicant database, to be able to recruit a larger pool of qualified applicants for faculty positions,” spokesperson David Dodds said in a statement.
The University of Utah said it had a table at annual conferences hosted by the nonprofit in the 2024-25 school year and two previous years. It cut ties with the project in October after settling with the department, university spokesperson Rebecca Walsh said.
Out of 170 PhD students admitted to Utah's business school over the past 14 years, just two were involved through the PhD Project, Walsh said.
The Education Department said that all of the 31 universities have also agreed to review partnerships with other organizations “to identify any that violate Title VI by restricting participation based on race.”
The administration has targeted a wide range of practices that it has labeled as diversity, equity and inclusion.

Team USA wins gold over Canada in women's hockey overtime thriller at Winter Games

Team USA wins gold over Canada in women's hockey overtime thriller at the Winter Olympics
Team USA defeated Canada in a stunning 2-1 overtime comeback win at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games to take home their third Olympic gold medal in women's ice hockey.
After being down 1-0 headed into the third period, the U.S. tied things up late in the period and scored the game-winner in overtime to avenge their loss in the final match from four years ago. This was the seventh gold medal match, and fifth in a row, between the two hockey powerhouses. It was also the third U.S.-Canada showdown to go to overtime.
Team USA captain Hilary Knight prolonged her final game at the Olympics by sending it to overtime tied 1-all.
Knight deflected Laila Edwards' shot past Ann-Renee Desbiens with 2:04 left in regulation and the U.S. skating 6 on 5 with goaltender Aerin Frankel pulled for an extra attacker. The goal was her 15th at the Olympics, the most in team history.
Canada had led since Kristin O'Neill scored short-handed less than a minute into the second period, ending the U.S. shutout streak at 352 minutes, 17 seconds. Desbiens and Frankel went save for save in a back-and-forth game that was far more competitive than the rivals' first meeting in the preliminary round, when the U.S. routed Canada 5-0.
The Americans romped through the tournament, outscoring opponents 31-1.
The U.S. and Canada have met in all but one Olympic final — the 2006 Turin Games won by Canada — since women's hockey made its debut at the 1998 Nagano Games. The loss gives Canada its third silver medal in the event.
Knight, 36, has already announced these will be her U.S.-record fifth and final Games, with a shot at adding a second gold medal to go with her three silvers. The game was played a day after Knight proposed to U.S. speedskater Brittany Bowe.
The defending Olympic champion Canadians had shown signs of age during a tournament in which they lost 5-0 to the Americans in the preliminary round, and eked into the final with a 2-1 win over Switzerland.
The loss to the Americans was the most lopsided and also the first time the Canadian women were shut out in Olympic play.
Canada had captain Marie-Philip Poulin back in the lineup after missing two games — including the loss to the U.S. — with a right knee injury.
Switzerland beat Sweden in overtime in the bronze medal game on another clutch goal by Alina Müller.

Millions of Americans do not know they have this chronic condition
- A report from the American Heart Association reveals that nearly one in four adults in the U.S., approximately 9.6 million people, have undiagnosed diabetes.
- The report also indicates that 96 million Americans have prediabetes, with around 30 million adults (10.6 per cent of the adult population) having diagnosed diabetes.
- Diabetes is a significant health concern in the U.S., being a leading cause of death and a major risk factor for heart disease, responsible for over 95,000 deaths annually.
- The American Heart Association is urging increased awareness and professional care, as diabetes often develops slowly and silently without visible symptoms.
- New research has identified that red blood cells, particularly in low-oxygen environments like high altitudes, can absorb sugar from the bloodstream, potentially offering novel approaches to controlling blood sugar.

TEL AVIV, February 19. /TASS/. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said Israeli troops will remain in the Gaza Strip forever.
"The IDF will remain in the Gaza security zone forever," he was quoted as saying by the Ynet news portal.
Addressing the officers' course graduation ceremony at Officer Training Base 1, he mentioned Israel’s strikes on Yemen and Iran, delivered last year.
"We will not allow threats of annihilation against Israel in the future either - and we will act against any threat, near and far," he said. "The policy today is one of initiative, decisiveness, removal of threats and defense of Israeli borders and communities from enemy territory."

What Moses would have asked about the Board of Peace - comment
Unknown

06:11:37 KST

There is a question buried in this week's parasha, Terumah, that has haunted Jewish thought for centuries and feels, this week, startlingly contemporary.
God instructs Moses to tell the Israelites to bring gifts, each one according to what his heart moves him to give, and from those gifts to build a Mishkan, a sanctuary. The instruction that follows is precise in a way we might easily miss: "Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them." Not in it. Among them. The Mishkan matters because of what its construction represents: a people choosing, freely and together, to build something that transcends any one of them.
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks spent much of his life thinking about what that distinction means for politics. He believed, deeply and consistently, that the great question of our age is whether we have the moral architecture to sustain what we build. Power is relatively easy to assemble. Covenant is harder. And without a covenant, without the willing participation of the people who will actually live inside whatever you construct, even the most generously funded structure eventually collapses.
This is why he watched Barack Obama so intently. Obama, Sacks felt, had understood something that most Western politicians had forgotten: that to lead is to tell a story of hope. That the covenant model, binding people together around shared obligation rather than competing interests, was the most sophisticated political technology ever devised. When Obama stood before two million people in Washington in January 2009 and spoke of promises handed from generation to generation, of eyes fixed on the horizon, of a gift of freedom carried forward to children's children, Sacks heard the cadences of Deuteronomy. He heard Moses.
He also heard something else. A warning, implicit in every covenant story: that the structure only holds if the people build it themselves. A sanctuary designed without the participation of those who will dwell in it is an imposition.
Which brings us to Washington this week, and to the Board of Peace.
The numbers are serious. Seventeen billion dollars pledged. Thirty-two thousand troops committed. Rafah named as the first test case. By the standards of international diplomacy, this is not nothing. The United Nations spent eighteen months producing working groups and envoys and institutional hand-wringing while Gaza burned. The BOP at least has a sequencing logic: disarmament first, reconstruction next, stabilization alongside it. It has donors and soldiers in the same room, connected by a single political condition.
What would Rabbi Sacks have said?
Sacks would have acknowledged all of this. He was clear-eyed about power, and clear-eyed about the United Nations. He knew that winning a war is easy and winning a peace is hard, and that peace requires structures, money, and sometimes the credible presence of force.
But he would have asked the question that the pledge numbers leave unanswered. Where is the covenant? Who sat in that room as someone who will actually live in whatever gets built? The Palestinian people, two million of them, were absent from the table. The Mishkan was built from the Israelites' own willing contributions, each person giving what their heart moved them to give. A sanctuary designed elsewhere and delivered as a finished product belongs to a different tradition entirely.
Sacks understood that legitimacy grows from within. From the sense that this is ours, that we built this, that we have a stake in its survival. A structure raised without that conviction requires permanent maintenance by outside forces, which is a different kind of project, and a far more costly one.
He would also have noticed the deeper irony. The covenant idea, the belief that a society coheres through shared moral obligation rather than concentrated power, is a Jewish idea that traveled through the Hebrew Bible into the political imagination of America and became the foundation of its democratic experiment. It is an idea that, as Sacks observed with a mixture of pride and sadness, is more alive in Washington than in Jerusalem.
And yet here is Washington, assembling a framework for Gaza's future, with all the resources and moral ambition the covenant tradition eventually made possible, and still searching for the covenant itself. For the thing that made it work.
Terumah teaches that the sanctuary lives in the giving. In the moment when people who have every reason to hold back choose instead to contribute, freely, to something they believe in. That is when God dwells among them. Among them, the text insists. The gold and the acacia wood and the linen curtains matter only because of the hands that offered them willingly.
The Board of Peace has measured the curtains carefully. The harder question, the one Moses would have asked, the one Sacks would have asked, is whether anyone has thought about the giving.

Leaked security footage debunks Tucker Carlson’s claim of being detained at Ben-Gurion Airport

Tucker Carlson was seen hugging and taking a photograph with a Ben-Gurion Airport employee, according to footage circulating on social media on Thursday, contradicting his claim to The Daily Mail that he was detained and hauled off by security.
In the video, he was seen smiling and hugging staff at the airport. He appeared to be unaccompanied, further contradicting his claims that he was travelling with security guards.
Sources confirmed to The Jerusalem Post that Carlson did not leave the airport during his visit and conducted the interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee there. He departed Israel around 3 p.m., concluding a trip that lasted only a few hours.
"Men who identified themselves as airport security took our passports, hauled our executive producer into a side room, and then demanded to know what we discussed with Ambassador Huckabee," Carlson stated in his Wednesday interview with The Daily Mail.
A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Israel told The Daily Mail that Carlson's claims were inaccurate and clarified that he only received the same passport-control questions that many visitors to Israel encounter.
Israel Airports Authority further confirmed that Carlson was "politely asked a few routine questions, in accordance with standard procedures applied to many travelers" in a late Wednesday X/Twitter post.
The questions were asked in a private, VIP lounge to protect his and his party's privacy, the authority said, adding that "no unusual incident occurred" and it rejects any such claims.
Bennett: 'Chickens***' Carlson landed in Israel, faked harassment
Former prime minister Naftali Bennett slammed Carlson following his brief visit to Israel, calling him "a chickens***" and saying that he has been "spouting lies about Israel."
In his remarks, shared late Wednesday on X/Twitter, Bennett accused Carlson of lying and of trying to portray a false image of his visit to Israel.
Bennett continued, arguing that Carlson "didn’t even step foot in the country" yet "made up a story that he’s being supposedly harassed by our security."
Finally, Bennett said, Carlson "whined" about his experience before flying off in his private jet.
Tobias Siegal, Tobias Holcman, and Shoshana Baker contributed to this report.

WATCH: IDF foils terror plots in West Bank, destroys Hamas tunnels in Gaza

The IDF destroyed several Hamas tunnels east of the Yellow Line in the Beit Hanoun area of the Northern Gaza Strip, according to a Thursday statement.
This operation launched in January, the IDF said, and its broader goal was the destory terrorist infrastructure on the Israeli-controlled side of the Yellow Line.
One of the tunnels was approximately one kilometer long, the IDF said, and it contained several living quarters as well as explosive devices.
Also on Thursday, the IDF released helmet camera footage from recent operations in the West Bank, showing soldiers from the Duvdevan unit making arrests in two different villages near the city of Nablus.
One detainee was involved with the production of explosives in the area and the promotion of terrorist plots.
The other was previously associated with the Lions Den terrorist organization and possessed a gun and ammunition with which he was planning to attack IDF soldiers.
Late on Wednesday night, the IDF struck several Hezbollah targets in south Lebanon, which it claimed were terror infrastructure sites. These included weapons storage facilities and missile launchers, among other sites, according to the IDF.
These strikes were a response to Hezbollah's "repeated violation of the ceasefire understandings," the IDF said, adding that just the presence of such infrastructure sites constituted a violation of the understandings.

War-hammered Gaza needs basics like homes, roads and power. FIFA is offering a $50M soccer stadium

War-hammered Gaza needs basics like homes, roads and power. FIFA is offering a $50M soccer stadium
FIFA says it'll pay to build a new $50 million national soccer stadium in war-ravaged Gaza, where two years of fighting between Hamas and Israel have left housing, electricity and basic infrastructure severely damaged
- Bookmark
The Gaza Strip is in ruins with entire city neighborhoods reduced to rubble and serious questions about rebuilding basic water and sewage facilities, roads, electrical grids and the critical infrastructure needed to consistently produce enough food to prevent widespread starvation.
But a gleaming new national soccer stadium for an area devastated by two-plus years of war between Israel and Hamas? That's covered — or so promises the sport's international governing body.
The unusual pledge was part of a showy and often strange display of political theater at the inaugural meeting of President Donald Trump ’s Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, where nine governments pledged $7 billion toward a Gaza relief package and five others said they'd deploy troops as part of an international stabilization force.
“We don’t have to just rebuild houses or schools or hospitals or roads,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “We also have to rebuild and build people, emotion, hope and trust. And this is what football, my sport, is about.”
FIFA pledged $50 million for a new stadium holding between 20,000 and 25,000 spectators, and said it would build a $15 million FIFA academy. The organization also promised to spend an additional $2.5 million for 50 “arena mini pitches,” or soccer fields, and five full-sized fields costing $1 million each.
Gaza doesn't have a national soccer team. A unified Palestinian squad represents it and the West Bank and has been recognized by FIFA since 1998 — but has never qualified for the World Cup.
“Football, or soccer, as it is called here, is the world’s universal language,” Infantino said. “It’s about hope. It’s about joy. It’s about happiness. It’s about coming together. It’s about uniting the world.”
He showed a video that proclaimed, “A simple ball. A shared field. A reason to believe again,” while noting that FIFA and the Board of Peace were joining forces to “turn football into a bridge toward peace, dignity and hope.”
The video mentioned FIFA creating Gaza soccer leagues at youth, amateur and regional levels and promised a “complete football ecosystem designed to support communities and future generations.”
Infantino has become a regular presence at the White House ahead of this year's World Cup, jointly hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada. He also frequently pops up at Trump events while the president is traveling. He showed up in Davos, Switzerland, last month when the Board of Peace — part of a larger White House-brokered ceasefire to end the fighting in Gaza — was formally launched.
Trump repeatedly singled out Infantino during his own remarks on Thursday at the Board of Peace event while attempting to gloss over the fact that many top U.S. allies — including Britain and Canada — haven't joined.
“Virtually everyone is the head of a country,” Trump said of the board's members, while noting that Infantino is “head of soccer, so that’s not so bad."
“I like your job the best, I think,” Trump said.
Thursday’s attendees were given Make American Great Again-style red hats with “USA” in white letters and featuring “45-47” signifying Trump’s two presidential terms. Infantino briefly wore his, as did others assembled.
The president gave shout-outs to Infantino during several stories on divergent topics, including when Trump suggested that he'd personally been a more successful real estate developer than his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and as he recounted how an escalator stopped while the president was on it during last fall's U.N. General Assembly meeting — an incident Trump suggested should trigger arrests, but didn't.
Trump even explained to Infantino that B-2 bombers carry “very big bombs.”
But the president's most effusive praise for Infantino was related to his organization having awarded Trump a new FIFA peace prize last year — after the president lobbied hard for a Nobel Peace Prize but was snubbed by the Norwegian committee that awards it.
“I think they saw that I got screwed by Norway,” Trump said.

Breaking Down the Ending of The Night Agent Season 3

Warning: Spoilers ahead for The Night Agent
At the end of The Night Agent’s second season, Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) stops a catastrophic chemical attack at the United Nations by crossing an ethical boundary. To get the terrorists’ location, he cuts a deal with Jacob Monroe (Louis Herthum), a shadowy information broker, stealing classified documents that allow Monroe to manipulate a presidential election and help install Governor Richard Hagan into the Oval Office. The cost is permanent: Peter avoids prison only by agreeing to work with the FBI as a covert mole inside Monroe’s operation, a hero reckoning with the cost of his heroism.
“We liked the idea at the end of Season 2 that Jacob’s unaccounted for and he's still out there in the world,” says showrunner Shawn Ryan. “We thought there was a lot more to explore in terms of who he was.”
Indeed, throughout the third season of the hit Netflix show, Peter must find and confront Jacob again, only to learn there’s more to his story—and that he may be a symptom of something much larger. The intrigue detonates immediately with a commercial flight taken down by a missile strike, setting off a widening conspiracy. When a young Treasury agent uncovers a trail linking American companies to a crypto wallet used by the terrorist group claiming responsibility, Peter begins an investigation with a dogged financial reporter, Isabel (Genesis Rodriguez), navigates a suspicious White House-assigned handler, and races to uncover a dark-money network while staying one step ahead of a hired assassin.
It all comes to a head in the Season 3 finale, “Razzmatazz,” when Peter and Isabel expose Walcott Capital, the shadow bank quietly underwriting chaos, in a live interview with its owner. The reveal is damning: Walcott helped bankroll the terrorist organization. Even worse, it served as the financial back channel for the President and First Lady’s campaign, laundering Jacob’s illicit donation into a stack of clean cash built to win an election. The campaign finance transgression spurs on a senate conviction, then a disgraced White House exit, leading to another regime change in Washington.
Here, Ryan breaks down the ending of the show’s latest chapter, sharing the thinking behind a few key plotlines, and teasing a small detail about Season 4, which is currently being written.
How Walcott Capital became an unlikely villain
In order for the White House to cover up their involvement with Jacob and Walcott Capital, President Hagan enlists Adam (David Lyons), the partner he assigned to watch Peter, to eliminate everyone with knowledge of their criminal activity. That started with killing Jacob, but now it means betraying both Peter and Chelsea Arrington (Fola Evans-Akingbola), the First Lady’s ex-Secret Service detail, as they drive up to New York City.
Though the pair manage to give Adam the slip, Hagan quickly escalates things, dispatching two hired guns to the condo of Freya (Michaela Watkins), the icy head of Walcott Capital, where Isabel has been pressing her for a public interview after obtaining a damning list of her clients’ illegal transactions. Freya initially dismisses her questions as journalistic theater, but that calculation changes the moment she realizes she’s also landed on the President’s hit list. Her reputation means nothing if she doesn’t survive the night, forcing both Freya and Isabel to make separate, desperate escapes as the government goons tear through her condo.
According to Ryan, the idea to make a shadow bank one of the show’s villains initially came to him in 2016, when the Panama Papers were released, exposing a global network of offshore entities used by politicians, celebrities, and criminals to evade taxes. “We live in a world where money rules and sometimes, people choose money over ethics. Our theme here is that those people are just as bad as the people committing the crimes,” he says. “We wanted to shine a light that this is going on in the world, that there are institutions that aren't living up to their civic responsibilities.”
Peter’s purity keeps him and Freya alive
“Promise you’ll do the right thing, even if it’s hard,” Peter’s mother tells him at the beginning of Season 3.
It’s a line that might as well reverberate throughout the entire season, but especially after Peter races to New York to help Freya to safety. On their way to The Financial Register offices, Peter runs into one of Hagan’s assassins and nearly gets beaten to death inside the subway (Ryan notes that Basso wanted Peter to “get his ass kicked” by a bigger, tougher guy), at least until Freya helps Peter discharge a well-placed nail gun.
Outside the subway station, Peter still has one more foe to take down once Adam reappears with a gun pointed at him. This time, instead of pulling out another clever weapon, Peter walks straight towards his partner, insisting that Hagan has co-opted him for a dirty cause. “Are you willing to die for this?” Adam asks. As Peter continues to walk past him, Adam can only appreciate his partner’s integrity and must reconsider Hagan’s illicit actions.
“Adam was a soldier that believed in following orders and believed in doing the right thing. And he'd been led astray by his Commander in Chief,” Ryan says. “Peter doesn't triumph because he wins the fight. He wins because of character—and because, ultimately, Adam wants to be a better person than he's been at this moment.”
Isabel’s interview exposes presidential corruption
Once Freya makes it inside The Register, she agrees to go on record during a live video interview with Isabel in exchange for specific protections. The breaking news—and Isabel’s subsequent stories exposing more of Freya’s clients—eventually leads to the Hagans’s conviction and exit from the White House. After two seasons of Peter chasing around Rose Larkin, Isabel proves to be more than a distressed damsel, solidifying journalism’s crucial place in holding power accountable and aiding governmental investigations at large.
The decision to platform a high-profile journalist came from Ryan’s own love for journalism movies, but also his belief that the enterprise can still have significance in 2026. “It takes a combination of what Peter does and what Isabel does to kind of wrap things up satisfactorily,” he says. “To me, journalists are stand-ins for the audience who want questions answered. They want to know what's really going on in the world and they want to feel like people who are doing bad things are being exposed and people who are doing good things are being celebrated.”
How Jacob Monroe became a tragic figure
In some ways, the President’s downfall can be traced back to Jacob’s decades-long obsession with Raul Zapata, a Mexican businessman and the covert leader of the LFS terrorist organization. Throughout the third season, it’s revealed that Zapata murdered Jacob’s romantic partner, Sofia, after a business transaction went wrong—an act that spurs Jacob’s transformation into a ruthless foreign operator, using secrets and leverage against the American government for the ultimate revenge (which just happened to include working alongside various terrorist groups and making improper campaign contributions through illegal backchannels).
But Ryan argues that the sequence of events doesn’t take into account Jacob’s unwillingness to save Sofia when given the chance. “He didn't stand up for her in a crucial moment. He didn't sacrifice himself for her,” he says. “The secret sauce of that revenge is his guilt over not being the man that he would have liked to be. And it sort of ruins him and turns him to the dark side. It’s a sort of Darth Vader storyline.
“He was blackmailed and used,” Ryan adds. “And the lesson he learned from that is it's better to be on the other side of that, and that's how you get people to do what you want—and he took it to the logical extremes over the course of the next 30 years.”
What’s next for Peter, the Hagans, and Freya?
Despite losing his FBI handler Catherine, Peter is finally in a good place at the end of Season 3. He’s earned some well-deserved time off, finds his favorite ice-cream in Central Park, and might even have a familiar partner waiting for him when he returns to action.
The Hagans on the other hand? They’re only shown briefly departing the White House, giving a Nixon-esque wave goodbye before airlifting out of Washington in a helicopter. But that won’t be the end of their public life, as a news ribbon indicates they’ve already signed a media deal, the kind of realistic headline we’ve come to expect in today’s political climate. Ryan thought it was a fitting button that resembles the times we’re living in. “There's a feeling that people who have power and money and wealth and influence don't pay the price that they should for the crimes they commit—and because they don't, they're sort of more incentivized to commit those crimes,” he says. “It does feel like there's a lot less shame in the world today for this behavior, and that a lot of people are on the grift.”
Of course, Freya doesn’t get off so easily, either. After threatening to kill her hired assassin (Stephen Moyer) after he abruptly retires, he reappears with his revenge on his mind, poisoning her drink at a beachside resort without her noticing. It only underscores the importance of knowing exactly who you’re getting into business with—an idea that causes Ryan to perk up when I raise it: “You may have touched on something we're already planning for Season 4,” he says.

Ex-German president criticizes Merz over refusal to supply Taurus missiles to Ukraine
Gauck made the remarks on the talk show Maischberger, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"This is a mistake. We see the aggressor with all his military capabilities, yet we treat the victim of aggression as if it were the threat to peace. That is unacceptable!" Gauck said.
According to him, the refusal is driven by fear of escalation – precisely what Putin wants.
"Why are we doing this? Out of concern that something might happen. But Putin takes our fears into account. He thinks: every threat I make restrains your resolve. This game works in his favor. That's why we need a new, serious approach," Gauck said.
He drew a parallel with the Cold War era.
"Just as in the time of the great bloc confrontation: always ready for negotiations on the one hand, but on the other – as Willy Brandt and others did – never surrender your own strength. Instead, say: I am a serious player on the field. I'm not waiting for you to become good or tolerant. I respond to your armament with my own, and you will see: if you go too far, it will cost you dearly," he said.
Gauck stressed that weakness encourages those who disregard the law. "The weakness of the decent is an encouragement to the shameless. We must constantly remind ourselves of that. Peace will not be secured by those who pretend the victim does not need support!" he said.
He also warned against misunderstanding pacifism. "We have begun to wake up after the 'turning point' speech by the previous chancellor. After Merz's speech at the Munich conference, we have already gotten out of bed. Now we just need to start moving. That is why we are rearming. We are rearming because those who violate the law and attack another country have no moral restraints regarding the weapons they use. And if we treat the victim of aggression by denying it the weapons needed for defense, what kind of virtue is that?" Gauck said.
He stressed the importance of rearmament and military support for Ukraine, noting that Ukraine is also defending Europe.
"There are people who have woken up. And they ask: what does someone who disregards the law respond to? Someone who shoots people mercilessly? That is what Putin does. He does not want only Ukraine. He wants more. That is why Ukrainians are defending us. That is why, together with Macron and others who are truly ready, we must spend money on armaments. This must be done!" Gauck concluded.

Netanyahu warns Iran of response it ‘cannot even imagine’ if it attacks Israel

TEL AVIV, February 19. /TASS/. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Iran of a potential response it "cannot even imagine" should it venture to attack Israel.
"We are prepared for any scenario. And if the Ayatollahs (the Iranian leadership - TASS) make the mistake of attacking us, they will experience a response they cannot even imagine," he said during the cadet graduation ceremony at the military academy.
According to Netanyahu, he articulated Israel’s position on the Iranian issue to US President Donald Trump during his visit to Washington last week. Israel insists that Tehran refuse from all of its stockpiles of enriched uranium and completely demolish the entire enrichment infrastructure. Apart from that, Israel demands that Iran curtail its missile program, limiting itself to missiles with a range of no more than 300 kilometers and stop providing assistance to its allies throughout the Middle East.
Earlier, CBS reported that the American administration is considering striking Iran on February 21. In January, the White House warned that it was ready to use force if Tehran fails to engage in talks aimed at reaching a "fair deal" under which Iran completely drops any plans to obtain nuclear weapons. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it had no plans of creating a nuclear bomb.
On February 17, the second round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the nuclear issue took place in Geneva, mediated by Oman. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached mutual understanding on a number of issues, which could serve as a basis for a draft future agreement on the nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of aspects but Tehran is not yet ready to accept some of the fundamental positions outlined by the White House. Earlier, the United States and Israel insisted that Iran not only scrap its nuclear program, but also stop producing ballistic missiles and supporting pro-Iranian forces in the Middle East.

Prosecutors stand by former militant's conviction but blast judge's prior conduct as prosecutor
Georgia prosecutors defending the 2000 murder conviction of a onetime Black Panther leader known as H
- Bookmark
Georgia prosecutors defending the 2000 murder conviction of a onetime Black Panther leader known as H. Rap Brown say new DNA evidence still points strongly to his guilt in the shooting of two sheriff’s deputies. However, they also accuse the case’s original lead prosecutor, now a Fulton County judge who has handled several high-profile political cases, of “grave and clear” misconduct.
The striking Wednesday filing by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ office acknowledges serious wrongdoing by the former prosecutor and an FBI agent involved in the original investigation. But it argues that modern DNA testing, combined with ballistic evidence and trial testimony, leaves little doubt that Brown — by then known as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin — was responsible for the attack that killed one deputy and wounded another outside of Al-Amin's Atlanta home.
The former prosecutor, Robert McBurney, is a superior court judge and has been involved in some of the most politically charged cases in the country. Prosecutors described his conduct in Al-Amin's trial as “the most egregious” issue in the case.
Despite standing by the conviction, Willis’ office said it does “not object to a hearing to evaluate the case in its entirety,” potentially keeping alive a public reexamination of a prosecution that has long divided civil rights advocates and law enforcement.
Al-Amin died in prison in November, but his family wants a hearing to clear his name, their attorney Mawuli Davis said, adding, “His legacy is still at the center of this.”
The lead prosecutor
McBurney oversaw the special grand jury Willis used in her investigation that eventually resulted in the indictment of Trump and others over allegations that they illegally tried to overturn the president's narrow 2020 election loss in Georgia. Notably, though, McBurney barred Willis from seeking charges against then-state Sen. Burt Jones because she had hosted a fundraiser for his Democratic opponent in the lieutenant governor’s race, which McBurney ruled created an “actual and untenable” conflict of interest.
McBurney also declared Georgia’s restrictive abortion law unconstitutional — a finding the state Supreme Court has vacated in a case that is ongoing.
“A trifecta of issues”
“This case had a trifecta of issues which undermined the process and the public’s confidence in justice,” the filing says.
During closing arguments at trial, McBurney displayed a chart titled “Questions for the defendant” and asked questions meant to focus the jury’s attention on the fact that Al-Amin didn’t testify. Al-Amin also had court permission to remain seated during the trial for religious reasons, including not standing when the jury entered. McBurney implored the jury, “Don’t stand for him.”
Federal courts have ruled that McBurney violated Al-Amin's constitutional rights, but that it's unlikely his actions substantially affected the verdict.
This week's filing says McBurney “crossed the line from aggressive advocacy into misconduct that undermined the core principles of justice,” accusing him of misrepresenting evidence and withholding critical information from the defense, among other things.
“These were not minor oversights; they reflected a troubling pattern of behavior that prioritized winning over truth, and conviction over justice,” the filing says.
McBurney did not immediately respond to an email Thursday seeking comment.
FBI Special Agent James Campbell approached Al-Amin while he was on the ground in handcuffs, kicked and spit on him, and said, “This is what we do to cop killers,” the filing says. A reprimand of Campbell “did not clear SA Campbell's stain on the investigation,” it says.
Lawyers for Al-Amin have also maintained that Campbell planted the guns used to shoot the deputies at the site where Al-Amin was arrested.
The Associated Press was unable to find contact information for Campbell to seek comment.
Campbell had been transferred to Atlanta after shooting an unarmed Muslim man in the back of the head, the filing says. That man's supporters accused Campbell of planting a gun found at the scene.
The judge did not allow the jury to hear about the prior shooting after the defense presented newspaper articles about it, wanting to use that shooting to demonstrate bias and motive to plant guns. If defense attorneys had presented recently interviewed witnesses rather than relying on articles, the judge likely would have allowed the jury to consider that information, the new filing argues.
New DNA evidence
Al-Amin's lawyers argued that nothing connected Al-Amin to the guns used to shoot the deputies. Willis' office used DNA testing that wasn't available at the time of the trial to test the guns and related items.
The tests excluded Al-Amin from the DNA found on both guns. But Al-Amin's DNA was identified on a leather belt wrapped around one of the guns, the filing says. That evidence is a strong indication of his guilt, especially when paired with prior ballistics evidence and testimony, the filing says.
The shooting
As a radical activist in the 1960s, Al-Amin once said violence was “as American as cherry pie” and that Black people would use violence, if needed, to fight oppression.
He converted to Islam during a prison stint and moved to Atlanta in the 1970s, becoming the leader of one of the nation’s largest black Muslim groups, the National Ummah.
On March 16, 2000, Fulton County sheriff’s deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English went to Atlanta’s West End neighborhood, where Al-Amin lived, was an imam and owned a grocery store, to serve a warrant for failure to appear in court on charges of driving a stolen car and impersonating a police officer during a traffic stop the previous year.
English testified at trial that Al-Amin fired a high-powered assault rifle when the deputies tried to arrest him. Then, prosecutors said, he used a handgun to fire three shots into Kinchen’s groin as the wounded officer lay in the street.
He was arrested four days later in White Hall, Alabama, a small town where he had helped develop a Muslim community.

Peru's new president under fire over past child marriage comments

Peru's eighth president in a decade has faced criticism within hours of taking office, with scrutiny over past remarks on child marriage and previous misconduct allegations.
Jose Maria Balcazar, 83, was named interim leader on Wednesday for just over five months after his predecessor, Jose Jeri, was impeached over graft allegations.
Jeri, 39, became the latest president to fall amid a cycle of institutional turmoil in which Congress has clashed with a weakened executive against a backdrop of chronic corruption and rising violence.
In the past decade, four presidents have been impeached, two have resigned to avoid the same fate and only one has completed a full term.
Four former leaders are currently behind bars.
A lawyer and former judge representing the leftist Peru Libre party, Balcazar was removed from the Supreme Court bench in 2011 for misconduct and expelled from a regional bar association in 2022 for ethical and criminal violations.
Non-governmental organisations have also criticised his past comments on women's rights.
Controversial record
During a 2023 congressional debate on ending child marriage, Balcazar said "early sexual relations aid a woman's psychological future."
Peru passed a reform that year banning marriage for anyone under 18, a change he had opposed.
The Flora Tristan Peruvian Women’s Center described his nomination as emblematic of a "profound ethical and democratic crisis" in the country.
Balcazar has said his remarks were distorted and taken out of context.
Fernando Rospigliosi, interim president of Congress, called Jeri’s removal "a very serious mistake," while former presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori said Balcazar's nomination marked "a very sad day for the country."

US trade deficit swells in December as imports surge
The second straight monthly deterioration in the United States’ trade deficit occurred as US firms boosted imports of computer chips and other tech goods.
The United States trade deficit has widened sharply in December amid a surge in imports, and the goods shortfall in 2025 was the highest on record despite US President Donald Trump’s tariffs on foreign-manufactured merchandise.
The second straight monthly deterioration in the trade deficit reported by the US Commerce Department on Thursday suggested that trade made little or no contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter.

Exports rose 6 percent last year, and imports rose nearly 5 percent.
The US deficit in the trade of goods widened 2 percent to a record $1.24 trillion last year as American companies boosted imports of computer chips and other tech goods from Taiwan to support massive investments in artificial intelligence.
Amid continuing tensions with Beijing, the deficit in the goods trade with China plunged nearly 32 percent to $202bn in 2025 on a sharp drop in both exports to and imports from the world’s second-biggest economy. But trade was diverted away from China. The goods gap with Taiwan doubled to $147bn and shot up 44 percent, to $178bn, with Vietnam.
Trump last year unleashed a barrage of tariffs against trading partners with the aim, among other things, of addressing trade imbalances and protecting US industries. But the punitive duties have not yielded a manufacturing renaissance, with factory employment declining by 83,000 jobs from January 2025 through January 2026.
“There just isn’t any evidence out there in the economic research literature to suggest that tariffs have materially impacted trade deficits historically when countries have implemented them,” said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The trade gap ballooned by 32.6 percent to a five-month high of $70.3bn, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis and the US Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters forecast the trade deficit would contract to $55.5bn.
The report was delayed because of last year’s government shutdown.
Imports increased 3.6 percent to $357.6bn in December. Goods imports surged 3.8 percent to $280.2bn, boosted by a $7bn increase in industrial supplies and materials, mostly non-monetary gold, copper and crude oil. Capital goods imports increased by $5.6bn, lifted by computer accessories and telecommunications equipment. That rise is likely related to the construction of data centres to support artificial intelligence.
But consumer goods imports fell, pulled down by pharmaceutical preparations. There have been large swings in imports of pharmaceutical preparations because of tariffs.
“But strong imports should also imply strength in details like inventories or business investment,” said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup. “Surging computer imports in particular should correspond with stronger business equipment investment and could remain strong due to AI-related demand.”
Exports fell 1.7 percent to $287.3bn in December. But capital goods exports increased, boosted by semiconductors. There were increases in exports of consumer goods, including pharmaceutical preparations.

‘I don’t like young, handsome men’ Trump insists before he torches ‘attractive’ AOC in rambling Peace Board speech
Trump’s speech to his Board of Peace, a group of mostly autocratic leaders, included threats on Iran and yet more complaints about not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ... and bizarrely ended with the Village People’s YMCA
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump couldn't stop himself from embarking on a nearly 40-minute ramble through a wide variety of disparate topics at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace, charged with overseeing implementation of his 20-point Gaza peace plan — including his dislike for attractive males and the appearance of one of his most prominent female foils in the U.S. Congress.
Trump was winding his way through his latest digression from prepared remarks, praising himself and the group of autocrats and Middle Eastern monarchs who have joined his panel when he found himself seemingly feeling the need to affirm his sexual preferences after commenting on Paraguayan President Santiago Peña’s appearance, calling him a “young, handsome guy.”
“It's always nice to be young and handsome — it doesn't mean we have to like you. I don't like young handsome men,” Trump said.
“Women, I like. Men, no, I don’t have any interest,” he added before laughing nervously.
Trump then continued with his rundown of the world leaders in attendance at the event before pivoting from offering praise for Vice President JD Vance’s academic record to insulting the intelligence of “attractive” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by claiming the Boston University graduate “didn’t do well ... in college.”
Trump hit out at the Bronx Democrat, a longtime target of his rhetorical barbs, for a disastrously awkward answer she’d given days earlier during an appearance at the Munich Security Conference after she was asked about America’s defense commitment to Taiwan.
Ocasio-Cortez’s halting, hesitant answer was widely mocked in conservative media spaces over the last week, and though Trump didn’t mention her name it was clear about whom he was speaking.
“There was one young, attractive woman, she was unable to answer questions, and she didn't do so well like JD did in college,” Trump said, contrasting her academic record with the vice president’s.
“She was unable to answer a simple question. And she could have said, ‘well, I'm studying it, and I'll report back to you next week.’ You know, you can get away with that. But ... actually, I think it could be a career ending answer, because for 25 years, anybody running against her, I think ... is going to use that, that little piece of stuff. It was not good. It was not good,” Trump added.
The president continued his meandering speech for another 30 minutes, during which he repeated his oft-used boast about having singlehandedly ended as many as eight world conflicts, most of which are still ongoing despite his claims to the contrary.
The “Board of Peace” meeting was held at the former headquarters of the United States Institute for Peace, which Trump and his erstwhile “Department of Government Efficiency” boss Elon Musk attempted to hollow out last year by firing most of the independent organization’s employees and forcing the transfer of the institute’s gleaming headquarters to the State Department — which promptly renamed it after the president.
Trump remarked that “nobody knew what to name” the building — which had long been called the U.S. Institute for Peace — until Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered the renaming.
Although the president has long made a habit of slapping his name on everything from steaks to the Washington, D.C. arts center that is a memorial to assassinated president John F. Kennedy, he claimed Rubio had done so without his knowledge.
“Nobody believes it, and that's okay, but I appreciated it,” he said.
Trump’s remarks were the opening act of an hours-long session that saw most, of not all of the assembled leaders who’ve chosen to join the new international organization deliver short speeches of their own in which most of them offered over-the-top praise to the American president that was reminiscent of the sycophantic comments seen during one of his administration’s cabinet meetings.
Although he used the televised speech to saber-rattle at Iran’s leaders by threatening “bad things” if Tehran and Washington can’t reach a deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program within “the next, probably 10 days,” the leaders and top diplomats in attendance — plus FIFA president Gianni Infantino — each took pains to thank Trump and hail his commitment to the Gaza peace process, with the president announcing commitments of at least $7 billion from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait — plus troops or police training assistance from Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Albania, Egypt and Jordan.
Trump, who the organization’s charter lists as its chairman — a position he can hold for the rest of his life if he so desires — has in recent months tried to expand the new group’s supposed remit to something more in line with his outsized ambitions to position himself as a transformational American leader and an indispensable man of world history.
Rather than a purpose-built body to oversee the Gaza ceasefire and reconstruction as intended by the U.N., the charter signed by Trump the other “Board of Peace” members make no mention of the Gaza conflict or the fact that the board’s mandate is limited to Gaza and expires at the end of 2027.
Instead, it describes itself as “an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” that is composed only of “States invited to participate by the Chairman” — that’s Trump — and willing to donate $1 billion for a permanent membership.
Trump will also serve as the first American representative to the board — a position that will pass to his successor as president — but he’ll remain the board’s chairman for life.
None of the United States’ major European allies have elected to join the organization, and the only EU member state that has done so thus far is Hungary, which is led by autocratic Trump ally Viktor Orban.

UK will not let US use its bases for strike on Iran — newspaper

LONDON, February 19. /TASS/. The United Kingdom is not letting the United States to use its military bases to deliver strikes on Iran, The Times wrote citing sources.
According to the newspaper, Washington has been drafting detailed plans of a military operation against Iran, which include the use of the joint US-UK base on the Diego Garcia island in the Indian Ocean, and the Royal Air Force Station Fairford in Gloucestershire, the United Kingdom, which is the USAF's only European airfield for heavy bombers. According to The Times, London has not yet authorized the use of these facilities, fearing that the US strike on Iran would constitute "a breach of the international law."
The newspaper wrote that the UK government’s position has provoked the ire of US President Donald Trump, who publicly "attacked" the UK-Mauritius deal to hand over sovereignty over the Chagos Islands, hosting the Diego Garcia base, to Mauritius. The document was signed on May 22, 2025, but has not yet been ratified by the UK Parliament.
On Wednesday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer was making "a big mistake" by handing over the archipelago to Mauritius, adding that the UK government should not take steps that may potentially lead to the loss of control over the Diego Garcia base.
Trump said it was possible that Washington will have to use the Diego Garcia base to thwart an alleged attack that Iran may possibly try to carry out.

Trump calls Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest ‘so bad for the royal family’

US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, hours after the King’s brother was detained under suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad. To me, it’s a very sad thing,” Mr. Trump said Thursday.
Andrew, who used to be known as “Prince” before having his royal titles stripped, was arrested after police launched an investigation into claims that he shared sensitive information while on official visits as the UK as the country’s trade envoy with Jeffrey Epstein.
The claims emerged as part of the Epstein file’s that were recently released by Trump’s Department of Justice.

ISTANBUL
Jared Kushner, a key figure in US peace efforts, said Thursday that failure in the Gaza Strip is "not an option" as he outlined an ambitious vision for rebuilding the war-torn territory at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
"We are here to help the people of Gaza, to lift them up and give them every opportunity to succeed," said US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, describing the effort as a partnership with Gazans and Israelis to create "an environment that can be peaceful, that could be functional."
Kushner struck an optimistic tone about international cooperation, saying Muslims, Jews, Palestinians, Israelis and people from across the world had come together around "a common goal, which is peace and togetherness."
"We cannot change the past," he said, "but what you're seeing today is that we can potentially change the future if we focus and do this in the right way."
He said participants of the Board of Peace are "a very self-selecting group of countries that really believe that the future can be different," noting those involved were doing it "for their children and for their grandchildren."
A promotional video produced by Kushner outlined reconstruction efforts on the ground, describing the establishment of safe zones offering shelter, food, health care and education for Palestinian families.
Infrastructure work coordinated with the US and the World Bank would employ hundreds of thousands in rebuilding and commercial activities, while transport, water and energy systems would be restored.
The video set a three-year target for the full reconstruction of Rafah, reduced unemployment and Gaza's connection to the world through a corridor linking Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, extending to India and Europe.
Within a decade, Gaza will become a self-governing territory integrated into the region with thriving industry and housing, according to the video.

Epstein accuser's brother hopes former Prince Andrew's arrest signals 'house of cards' collapsing

Epstein accuser's brother hopes former Prince Andrew's arrest signals 'house of cards' collapsing
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON, Feb 19 - The brother of one of Jeffrey Epstein's most prominent accusers welcomed the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on Thursday, saying he hoped it marked the start of the collapse of a "house of cards" around late convicted U.S. sex offender Epstein.
In an interview with Reuters, Sky Roberts -- whose sister Virginia Giuffre took her own life in April -- and his wife urged the U.S. Justice Department to take action against others suspected of playing a role in Epstein's crimes.
"This is where the house of cards starts falling," Sky Roberts said in a joint interview with Amanda Roberts.
The release of millions of records on Epstein is roiling politics and business as details come to light on the disgraced financier's extensive social connections. The case has turned into a persistent political problem for President Donald Trump, who spent years fanning suspicions about Epstein and his associates before returning to office last year.
The files led to the arrest in Britain of King Charles' brother, Mountbatten-Windsor, on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, over allegations he sent confidential government documents to Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor was later released from police custody.
ANDREW SETTLED EARLIER SUIT
In 2022, the king's brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
Americans generally view the Epstein case as an example of wealthy and powerful people rarely being held accountable and believe the U.S. government is still hiding information about Epstein's clients, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.
"We are trailing too far behind in justice, especially when we are sitting on the mountains of information that we have," Amanda Roberts said. "The world is looking at us to do the right thing here."
Epstein, in exchange for immunity, pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge and served 13 months in jail. He was later arrested in July 2019 on charges of sex trafficking dozens of underage girls. His August 2019 death in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial was ruled a suicide.
Learning of the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor had brought "a mixed bag of emotions," said Amanda Roberts.
"Initially we were ... vindicated and screaming, at one point at 3 a.m. And then it just hits you - that gut punch of the fact that she's not here to see this, that we're not able to call her and tell her how astronomically proud we are of her." REUTERS

Trump warns Iran of ‘bad things’ if no deal made, appears to set deadline of 10-15 days

- President Trump warned Iran to make a nuclear deal within 10-15 days or face "really bad things," hinting at further US military action.
- Amid a massive US military buildup and war fears, Russia's warship joined Iranian naval drills, warning of "unprecedented escalation of tension."
- US-Iran nuclear talks are stalled; the US demands Iran cease uranium enrichment and missile development, which Iran refuses, heightening tensions.
AI generated
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump warned Iran on Feb 19 that it must make a deal over its nuclear programme or “really bad things” will happen, and appeared to set a deadline of no more than 10 to 15 days before the US might take action.
Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fuelled fears of a wider war, Mr Trump said negotiations with Iran to end the tense standoff were going well but insisted Tehran has to reach a “meaningful” agreement.
“Otherwise bad things happen,” Mr Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran, told the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington.
Mr Trump spoke of the US airstrikes carried out in June, saying Iran’s nuclear potential had been “decimated,” adding “we may have to take it a step further or we may not.”
“You’ll be finding out over the next probably 10 days,” he said.
Asked later to elaborate, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: “I would think that would be enough time, 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”
But he declined to be specific, except to warn again of “really bad things” and insist that Iran would have to make a deal one way or another.
‘Good talks’: Trump
Mr Trump’s threats to bomb Iran, with the two sides far apart in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, have pushed up oil prices, and a Russian corvette warship on Feb 19 joined planned Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, a vital sea route for global energy.
Iranian and US negotiators met on Feb 17 and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said they had agreed on “guiding principles.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Feb 17, however, that the two sides remained apart on some issues.
Mr Trump said “good talks are being had,” and a senior US official said Iran would make a written proposal on how to address US concerns.
Mr Trump called on Tehran to join the US on the “path to peace.”
“They can’t have a nuclear weapon, it’s very simple,” he said.
“You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon.”
Iran has resisted making major concessions on its nuclear programme, though insisting it is for peaceful purposes. The US and Israel in the past have accused Tehran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb.
Mr Trump’s latest sabre-rattling came as he talked himself up as a man of peace in a long, meandering speech while hosting world leaders at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace.
He proposed the body in September when he announced his plan to end Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. He later expanded the board’s remit to tackle conflicts worldwide, prompting many key Western allies to stay away.
Earlier on Feb 19, Russia warned against an “unprecedented escalation of tension” around Iran and urged restraint amid the US military buildup in the region, which a senior American official said should be complete by mid-March.
Threat of war
Mr Trump has sent aircraft carriers, warships and jets to the region, raising the prospect of another attack on the Islamic Republic.
The US and Israel bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities and some military sites last June. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss Iran on Feb 28, the senior US official said.
Washington wants Iran to entirely give up uranium enrichment, a process used to create fuel for atomic power plants but that can also provide material for a warhead.
The US and ally Israel also want Iran to give up long-range ballistic missiles, stop supporting groups around the Middle East and stop using force to quell internal protests.
Iran says it refuses to discuss issues beyond the atomic file, calling efforts to limit its missile arsenal a red line.
Satellite pictures have tracked both Iranian work to repair and fortify sites since last summer, showing work at both nuclear and missile sites, as well as preparations at US bases across the Middle East over the past month.
Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships.
In a sign of growing concern over the increased tensions, Poland on Feb 19 became the latest European country to urge its citizens to leave Iran, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying Poles may only have hours to evacuate.
Mr Trump began threatening strikes on Iran again in January as Iranian authorities crushed widespread protests with deadly violence that left thousands dead across the country. REUTERS

Ukrainian, Italian officials discuss strengthening Ukraine's defense industry
According to Ukrinform, Umerov shared details of the meeting via Facebook.
"We discussed defense, energy, and economic support for Ukraine, and synchronized our positions on the next steps in our cooperation," Umerov said.
Separate meetings were also held with the leadership of Italy's largest defense companies.
The talks focused on strengthening Ukraine's defense industry, particularly the development of air defense capabilities to protect Ukrainian cities, Umerov said.
He thanked Italy for its consistent support of Ukraine.
As Ukrinform earlier reported, during the full-scale war Ukraine's defense industry has demonstrated unprecedented growth: production capacity has increased 50-fold, reaching $50 billion. As a result, domestic manufacturers now supply more than half of Ukrainian forces' weapons needs.

On October 7 we got up just before 5:30 A.M. for a dawn alert. We were two tank crews of soldiers from the Golani Brigade at the "White House" outpost. We got dressed and entered the tank. Everything looked calm and, according to procedure, we went to sleep in the compartments, with one person staying awake to listen to the vehicle radio. We woke up suddenly from explosions of mortar shells and then calls of "Purple Rain" on the radio – warning of incoming rounds nearby. Immediately afterward, shouts of "There's been a penetration!" started.

Türkiye hopes US, Iran reach 'genuine negotiation' without need for war: Foreign minister
Hakan Fidan attends inaugural Board of Peace meeting, says parties to Iran talks 'giving unprecedentedly positive signals'
WASHINGTON
Türkiye hopes the US and Iran will reach a "genuine negotiation" without the need for a military operation or war, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
“Our wish is that there will be no need for a military operation or war, and that the parties genuinely reach a negotiation here," Fidan told Anadolu and TRT in the US capital, Washington, DC.
His remarks came right after attending the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which was presided over by US President Donald Trump, bringing together representatives from more than 45 countries to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction and broader international stabilization efforts.
"As you know, this is an issue we follow closely. The process that started in Istanbul has led Americans and Iranians to begin speaking again. This is an extraordinarily important development," Fidan said.
Following diplomatic efforts launched in Istanbul, the two sides met twice — once in Oman's capital Muscat and once in Geneva, Switzerland — he noted.
Fidan added that he also met with one of the parties in Washington to assess the direction of the talks.
“Essentially, there are many reasons to be hopeful,” he said. “We hope they reach a result, especially on the nuclear file.”
He noted that his recent discussions involving Oman as a mediator, along with his direct contacts with American and Iranian officials, have been more constructive than in the past.
“My impression from the current talks — speaking with the Omani mediator, with the United States, and with Iran — is that the parties are giving unprecedentedly positive signals, particularly in advancing certain concrete issues,” he added.
At the same time, he cautioned that rising military activity by the US in the region is being "closely" monitored.
“We observe that military mobility has also increased,” Fidan said.
"Of course, we are closely monitoring whether this military activity is intended to put pressure on the ongoing negotiations or whether it is preparation for a pre-planned military operation."
Despite encouraging diplomatic signals, Fidan stressed that the process remains at a delicate stage.
“How this becomes practically implementable, when it will happen, how the parties perceive it, and how that perception guides their next steps — we are at a critical threshold right now,” he said. “It needs to be followed carefully.”
Trump said Thursday that it would soon become clear whether a deal with Iran is possible, warning that Washington may be forced to escalate if negotiations fall short.

Poland not seeking to possess nuclear weapons — defense minister

MOSCOW, February 19. /TASS/. Poland honors its international nuclear non-proliferation commitments and has no plans to obtain nuclear weapons, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said.
"Poland is bound by relevant obligations under international conventions. This topic (striving to possess nuclear weapons - TASS) is not subject for a broad discussion," he said in an interview with the PAP, AFP, and DPA agencies.
However, in his words, Poland’s science should develop the nuclear sector.
Apart from that, he noted that Warsaw should be ready to cooperate with its NATO allies on nuclear weapons deployment initiatives.
Polish President Karol Nawrocki said in an interview with the Polsat television channel on February 15 that Poland should aim to develop nuclear capabilities. However, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said earlier that the Polish government is not discussing stationing nuclear weapons on the country's territory.
Poland’s former President (2015-2025) Andrzej Duda repeatedly advocated for deploying American nuclear weapons in Poland. In the spring of 2025, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stated that Poland would strive to gain access to the most modern types of weapons including nuclear weapons, supporting French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea to extend the French "nuclear umbrella" to other European countries.

US man found guilty of beating 4 to death in Chinatown, including HK migrant
The jury rejected an insanity defence by Randy Santos for the killings of Chuen Kok, 83, and three other homeless men in 2019
A man who fatally beat four sleeping men on the streets of New York’s Chinatown was convicted of first-degree murder on Thursday, with a jury rejecting his insanity defence in the 2019 rampage.
Randy Santos’ lawyers had conceded that he pummelled the defenceless victims – Chuen Kok, Anthony Manson, Florencio Moran and Nazario Vasquez Villegas – with a metal bar and meant to kill them.
But Santos’ lawyers contended that he was too mentally ill to be held criminally responsible. They said he was driven by schizophrenic delusions that made him believe he had to kill 40 people or would die himself.
Prosecutors countered that Santos took steps, such as sometimes looking out for potential witnesses, and subsequently made remarks that showed he knew the attacks were both illegal and immoral.
The Dominican-born Santos, 31, showed no reaction as he heard the verdict, through headphones, via a Spanish-language interpreter.
The killings spurred scrutiny of the city’s struggles to aid and protect a homeless population that had reached a record size. Santos was homeless, as were some of the victims. The slain men ranged in age from 39 to 83.

A palace in Marrakesh: How Schwab moved $27.7 million in payments for Epstein days before his arrest
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON/WASHINGTON/TORONTO, Feb 19 - Charles Schwab wired about $27.7 million on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein to a realtor in Morocco as the disgraced financier tried to purchase a palace in the 10 days before his 2019 arrest, including one transfer from an account which lacked sufficient funds, files released by the U.S. Department of Justice show.
Details of the transactions, reported by Reuters for the first time, show how the U.S. brokerage handled funds for Epstein over the course of several months at a time when he was under intense public scrutiny after reports in the Miami Herald in 2018.
Schwab flagged the payments in a suspicious activity report (SAR) to the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on July 13, seven days after Epstein's arrest, the documents show.
An examination of more than a hundred documents shows Schwab opened three accounts for Epstein's companies in April 2019, including one for Southern Trust, a business that was attempting to buy the opulent Bin Ennakhil palace in Marrakesh, Morocco.
The Schwab corporate account listed Richard Kahn, Epstein's accountant, as authorised individual and Epstein as Southern Trust's president and sole beneficial owner.
Between June 26 and July 9, 2019, Southern Trust instructed Schwab to wire about $12.7 million in euros for the purchase but then reversed the order. Schwab then received another wire request, which was signed by Epstein, and sent $14.95 million to buy the same property, even though there were insufficient funds in the account pending the return of the original payment.
Schwab declined to comment on details of the accounts, saying federal regulation, privacy laws and its policies and procedures require it to maintain confidentiality.
"An associate of Epstein opened accounts in April 2019. Shortly after, our Risk team began investigating the accounts and within 60 days of starting the review, we notified the client of our decision to close and terminate the relationship. We also referred the matter to federal law enforcement," it said in an emailed response to Reuters.
Schwab declined to provide details on exactly when its risk team began investigating.
Under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, financial firms must file a suspicious activity report no later than 30 days after the initial detection of facts, in addition to filing reports of cash transactions that exceed $10,000 daily to assist in detecting and preventing money laundering.
FinCEN declined to comment. A lawyer for Kahn did not respond to Reuters' questions.
Marc Leon, the realtor in Marrakesh, told Reuters by email that Epstein first tried to buy Bin Ennakhil in 2011 and negotiations on the terms and price continued over the years.
With gold-draped walls, a hammam steam spa, 60 marble fountains and an outdoor pool and jacuzzi, Bin Ennakhil spreads across a total plot of 4.6 hectares, a property listing included in the DOJ's file cache said. It boasts multiple gardens with hundreds of olive trees and more than 2,000 palms, the listing said, in an area bigger than New York's Washington Square Park or around six standard soccer pitches.
Leon also defended his role in facilitating Epstein's bid for the property.
"Epstein had been convicted of sex crimes (in 2008) and had served his sentence. There was therefore nothing to prevent him from attempting to purchase property in Morocco. We had no way of knowing that he had continued his terrible crimes," he said.
Epstein died in jail in August 2019 while facing U.S. federal sex trafficking charges.
EPSTEIN INSTRUCTED FUNDS TO BE MOVED
Epstein turned to Schwab in 2019 as Deutsche Bank was winding down accounts held by the convicted sex offender, who had pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl and went to prison.
Schwab was among at least seven financial firms subpoenaed by the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2020 requesting documents in relation to the co-executors of Epstein's estate. The subpoena did not name Schwab as a defendant and contained no accusations of wrongdoing against the brokerage.
Emails and wire transfer requests contained in the DOJ documents, which may not be comprehensive, show that Epstein discussed purchasing the luxury property in Marrakesh with his associates in the spring of 2019.
Southern Trust, the company owned by Epstein, agreed to buy the property through Leon in March of that year.
After considering various financial arrangements, the files show, Epstein instructed associates to move funds to Leon.
Schwab then received an order from Southern Trust to wire 11.15 million euros, roughly equivalent to $12.7 million at the time, to Leon on June 26, 2019, Schwab said in the SAR, which was seen by Reuters.
The SAR was contained in the batch the DOJ had released publicly, but has since been withdrawn for reasons Reuters could not ascertain. The DOJ declined to comment on the file.
The funds were sent to a Julius Baer account in Switzerland held by Leon, who was based in Marrakesh at the time, the SAR shows.
A file on the DOJ website also shows the request.
The next day, Schwab received a call from a person whose identity is redacted from the SAR requesting the termination of the transfer. Asked why, they told Schwab that terms on the real-estate deal had not been "agreeable".
The person also said another payment would be made for a larger sum to a different account, the SAR shows.
Schwab was successful in reversing the order, which would be credited back on July 10, the SAR shows.
Two days before Epstein's arrest, in a July 4 wire transfer request signed by Epstein and his co-signatory, Southern Trust instructed Schwab to send Leon $14.95 million, the SAR shows.
Schwab said the funds were sent to an account of Leon's at Julius Baer, the SAR shows.
Yet Epstein's Southern Trust account did not have sufficient funds because Schwab had not yet returned money from the earlier transfer, the SAR says.
While Schwab could have had a reasonable expectation that the payment would be transferred back to Epstein's account, the bank would have been exposed to risk until the funds were returned.
Reuters could not establish when the $12.7 million ultimately landed back in Epstein's account but the funds were due to arrive on July 10, the SAR dated July 13 shows.
Asked by Reuters about its policy at that time for processing international wire transfers when accounts had insufficient funds, Schwab declined to comment.
Reuters was not able to establish whether Julius Baer accepted the transfers. A spokesperson for Julius Baer declined to comment.
Leon said: "The anti-money laundering checks in force were carried out by the banking institutions involved in the future transaction, which ultimately never took place."
It was not until July 9, three days after Epstein's arrest, that Schwab cancelled the second transfer at the request of an individual acting on Epstein's behalf whose name is redacted, the SAR shows.
An email included in the other DOJ documents shows Epstein's accountant Kahn asked to cancel the transfer on July 9.
Kahn has been ordered to testify before Congress next week to answer questions about whether he helped to facilitate Epstein's crimes through his management of the late sex offender's financial affairs, House Oversight Committee member Robert Garcia said in a media statement in January.
Reuters has no evidence that Kahn is guilty of wrongdoing.
In a follow-up exchange with Schwab after Epstein's arrest, an unidentified Epstein associate asked if future transfers for Southern Trust's account would still require two signatures as more money would be sent soon, the SAR shows.
Epstein had been charged with sex trafficking of minors and remained in jail, the DOJ said on July 8.
Schwab told FinCEN in the July 13 SAR it had "concerns with attempted wires for the purpose of real estate, in light of negative media surrounding Jeffrey Epstein" and worries about him being a possible flight risk ahead of a bail hearing.
"This investigation is the result of an internal referral," the document shows Schwab saying.
While Epstein's deal fell through, the palace of Bin Ennakhil - which means "amidst the palms" - in Marrakesh is no longer vacant.
"The property has since been sold to another buyer," Leon told Reuters. REUTERS

Norwegian ex-diplomat questioned over alleged links to Epstein

ISTANBUL
Former Norwegian diplomat Terje Rod-Larsen has been questioned by Norway’s economic crime authority, Okokrim, over alleged links to late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and provided a detailed statement addressing all matters under investigation, his lawyer confirmed on Thursday.
Attorney John Christian Elden told public broadcaster NRK that the indictment “does not refer to specific actions,” making it difficult to determine what his client is directly suspected of. He stressed that Rod-Larsen does not admit guilt.
“Despite this, Rod-Larsen has, based on his health situation, explained in detail his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, including their interaction and financial relationship,” Elden said.
Okokrim confirmed that the hearing took place in Oslo. First State Prosecutor Marianne Bender, who is leading the investigation concerning Rod-Larsen and his wife, diplomat Mona Juul, said: “He has answered our questions, and we have the impression that he wants to cooperate with Okokrim.”
Rod-Larsen has also waived confidentiality for his former lawyers related to the purchase of an apartment in Frogner, allowing them to testify freely to investigators, authorities said.
Okokrim added that it is in contact with foreign governments as part of the probe and described the investigation as “extensive” and likely to take time.
On Jan. 30, the US Justice Department released more than 3 million pages of documents, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law last November.
Those materials include grand jury transcripts and investigative records, though many pages remain heavily redacted. Epstein survivors and victims’ relatives say the disclosure falls short of what the law requires and omits vital information.
Authorities found Epstein dead by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls.

Trump extends Ukraine-related national emergency, certain US sanctions against Russia for another year
U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 19 approved a one-year extension of the national emergency and related sanctions first introduced following Russia’s 2014 occupation of Crimea.
The decree continues measures first introduced in 2014 and later expanded in 2018 and 2022, including asset freezes and restrictions targeting individuals linked to Russia’s occupation of Crimea.
The document states that Russia’s actions “continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States,” justifying the extension of the national emergency first declared under Executive Order 13660.
Trump’s order maintains the national emergency framework established under Executive Order 13660, noting that the measures “must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2026.”
The restrictions have been updated multiple times in recent years, including during former President Joe Biden’s administration, as Washington responded to Russia’s full-scale invasion in Ukraine.
The extension comes amid renewed discussion in Washington and Moscow over the future of sanctions tied to negotiations on ending Russia’s war against Ukraine.
On Feb. 18, Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev claimed that lifting restrictions could unlock joint U.S.-Russia projects worth more than $14 trillion, arguing that sanctions have cost U.S. businesses more than $300 billion.
Moscow has reportedly floated large-scale economic cooperation proposals to Washington in exchange for sanctions relief, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the existence of any such agreement.

Nancy Guthrie investigators turn to Mexico, genealogy, pacemaker amid fears trail going cold
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
As the search for Nancy Guthrie stretches into its third week, there is growing concern that the trail to find the missing 84-year-old is rapidly growing cold.
Investigators have detained two people since Guthrie was abducted from her Tucson home in the early hours of Feb. 1. But both were released after questioning and no suspects have been publicly identified.
Authorities insist the case is still very much active, with the FBI receiving more than 20,000 tips. But the case is branching off into some new directions.
Look at Mexico
Law enforcement sources told The Times that investigators have been in touch with Mexican authorities in the case given Tucson’s close proximity to the border, but there is no evidence that the abductors crossed with Guthrie.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the case candidly.
The Guthrie home in Tucson is only about an hour’s drive from the border. Source stressed the request for help from Mexico was to exhaust all options but there is not any clear evidence suggesting either Guthrie or the kidnappers are there.
State of the investigation
DNA on a glove discovered 2 miles away from Guthrie’s home that matched those worn by a masked man seen on Nest camera footage didn’t return any matches in the national DNA database used by law enforcement, CODIS. Biological evidence that was found at Guthrie’s home is still being tested, but did not produce a match in CODIS, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told Fox News this week.
An anonymous donor this week gifted $100,000 to 88-CRIME for information that would lead investigators to arrest the individual involved in Guthrie’s disappearance. This is in addition to the $100,000 reward for information being offered by the FBI.
Nanos has tried to dispel concerns that investigators are hitting nothing but dead ends, telling NBC News that “as long as we have the ability to chase a lead, it’s not cold.”
“We have thousands of leads we’re looking at,” he said. “We’re going to find Nancy, and we’re going to find who did this.”
Video footage could be key
So far, experts say investigators’ best bet to solving the case quickly would be if someone recognizes the suspect in Nest video footage of a masked man seen on Guthrie’s porch the morning she was abducted.
At 1:47 a.m. Feb. 1, the individual appears at the door of Guthrie’s home. The man is wearing a balaclava, gloves and a backpack. A gun is holstered by the man’s waist, positioned at the front of his body and easily visible.
At one point, the man, who authorities describe as approximately between 5’9” and 5’10” with an average build, notices the camera on the front porch and tries to cover the lens with his hand. The man scouts around the patio and yard area apparently for something to obstruct the camera before settling on some greenery found in the yard.
In the video, the man is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack that can be purchased at Walmart, according to the FBI. Investigators have been working with Walmart leadership to see if they can identify who purchased the backpack.
Authorities are also canvassing gun shops showing the video released by the FBI to see if anyone recognizes him, according to the sheriff’s department.
Investigators employ genetic genealogy
DNA found inside the Guthrie home could also prove fruitful in the case, experts say.
While law enforcement did not get any hits in the federal database, they are also employing genetic genealogy in an effort to identify a suspect in the case.
“If they actually have the suspect’s DNA—Nancy’s kidnapper’s DNA—he will be identified through genetic genealogy,” said CeCe Moore, a genetic genealogist and co-founder of DNA Justice. “It’s just a matter of time.”
Authorities can compare DNA collected from Guthrie’s home to publicly accessible databases containing the genetic profiles of millions of people who have given them over for family history research and other reasons. From there, investigators can sometimes find distant relatives to help piece together a family tree that can point to a suspect.
The technology has helped solve some of the nation’s most high-profile cases in recent years. Investigators used genetic genealogy to identify Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. as the Golden State Killer who terrorized California in the 1970s and 80s. It was also used to secure the conviction of Bryan Kohberger, who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering four college students in Idaho in 2022.
There’s limitation to the technology, but law enforcement sources told The Times it’s likely the best way forward.
Law enforcement does not have easy access to the roughly 50 million genetic profiles contained in Ancestry.com, 23andMe and MyHeritage databases. The companies have barred authorities from accessing such information and said they would release it only if compelled by a court order or warrant.
Databases GEDmatch, FamilyTreeDNA and DNA Justice are open to law enforcement use, but contain less than 2 million genetic profiles, Moore said.
With fewer genetic profiles to work with there is more legwork involved, but Moore said it will likely be key to identifying a suspect.
“It could happen in minutes, hours, days, weeks, but I don’t think it’ll stretch much longer than that because of all the resources available for this case,” she said.
Searching for her pacemaker
Law enforcement has also deployed “signal sniffer” technology in the search for Guthrie.
Parsons Corp confirmed this week that the Pima County Sheriff’s Department requested its help early this month deploying BlueFly units to search for Guthrie. BlueFly is a Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensor that can be used on air and ground vehicles for search and rescue operations in challenging environments, providing authorities with a heat map to identify signals within a specific area, according to the company.
BlueFly can detect medical devices like Guthrie’s pacemaker.

Türkiye ready to contribute to Gaza 'in every way possible': Foreign minister
Hakan Fidan attends inaugural Board of Peace meeting presided over by US President Trump in Washington, DC
WASHINGTON
Türkiye is ready to contribute to Gaza "in every way possible," Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
"Our message is this: whether it's humanitarian aid, the administration of Gaza, infrastructure and superstructure services, or contributing to the (International) Stabilization Force, we are ready to provide all kinds of support in all these areas," Fidan told Anadolu and TRT in the US capital, Washington, DC.
His remarks came right after attending the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which was presided over by US President Donald Trump, bringing together representatives from more than 45 countries to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction and broader international stabilization efforts.
Fidan said the meeting, held at the level of heads of state and government, carried symbolic importance as its first session but also produced tangible commitments.
The minister stressed that member states, especially those contributing financially and potentially militarily to the International Stabilization Force, declared their commitments.
"In that sense, it was important in delivering concrete outcomes,” he added.
He described the gathering as a key milestone as Trump's Gaza plan enters its second phase, which focuses on reconstruction and restoring local governance structures.
Fidan emphasized that rebuilding Gaza requires not only physical reconstruction but also restoring functional local administrative bodies.
"The crucial point here is that as Gaza rebuilds, local government bodies need a serious renewal and capacity building in the essential services they provide to the people," he said, noting that much of Gaza’s infrastructure has been destroyed.
He highlighted ongoing coordination with the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), a 15-member technocratic body chaired by Ali Shaath, a Palestinian technocrat with extensive expertise in infrastructure, planning and public administration.
Fidan said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently discussed governance and reconstruction plans with Shaath.
Türkiye, he added, stands ready to assist in health, education and other capacity-building services inside Gaza beyond immediate humanitarian relief.
- Police training and possible military role
The minister said Türkiye has maintained uninterrupted humanitarian efforts since the beginning of the crisis, mobilizing state institutions and civil society organizations.
On Thursday, Fidan said a Turkish aid ship carrying supplies arrived at an Egyptian port en route to Gaza. Ankara is also seeking to send an initial 20,000 housing containers, he added.
In addition, Türkiye is continuing medical evacuations and operating field hospital services through its Health Ministry, he stressed.
As part of Gaza’s stabilization, Fidan said efforts are underway to establish a local police force capable of providing security and public services for more than two million residents.
"We have a commitment to provide training to the police force for this purpose. Our president also has the will to send troops to the stabilization force if the parties agree," Fidan added.
Türkiye, he said, will continue its efforts with “a strong sense of responsibility” to help secure lasting peace and stability in the region.

Trump’s Board of Peace gains international momentum after inaugural meeting - analysis

05:33:14 KST

Images and videos from US President Donald Trump’s monumental first Board of Peace meeting showed that things are off to a good start.
The Board of Peace’s vision emerged between September, when Trump was urging countries to support a ceasefire, and January, when the second phase of the ceasefire in Gaza was announced.
The large meeting on Thursday showed that many countries are willing to participate and believe the administration is serious, as over 40 countries sent officials.
The Board of Peace meeting took place amid growing tensions with Iran, which has sidelined focus on Gaza. The Board of Peace is expected to focus on Gaza reconstruction and other issues. Trump was praised by attendees for his work toward peace in other regions, such as in South Asia between Pakistan and India.
The meeting is being praised throughout the Middle East. Arab News in Saudi Arabia noted that “Saudi Arabia and others pledge $7bn for Gaza relief.”
The report noted that “President Donald Trump announced Thursday at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting that nine members of the body have agreed to pledge $7 billion toward a Gaza relief package and that five countries have agreed to deploy troops to take part in an international stabilization force to the war-battered Palestinian territory.” Saudi Arabia will pledge $1 billion toward the endeavor.
Multiple countries have pledged billions of dollars
The report said that “Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait are the other countries that are making pledges.” In addition, there appears to be progress on the International Stabilization Force for Gaza. “Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Albania have pledged to send troops for the Gaza stabilization force, while Egypt and Jordan have committed to train police for the efforts.”
Initial expectations are that troops will be deployed near Rafah and that a large base may be constructed. “Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region),” Trump said. “The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room.”
Many European countries remain skeptical of the Board. According to the Arab News report, “More than 40 countries and the European Union confirmed they were sending officials to Thursday’s meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board but are taking part as observers.”
This comes in the context of the Munich Security Conference and the Davos meetings over the last month. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke at the MSC, and he then went to Hungary. He spoke at the Board of Peace meeting.
Video from the Board of Peace meeting showed the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, speaking about which countries will participate. This is going to be a major test. Countries such as Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Morocco are expected to take part. Egypt and Jordan may help train police. Separate reports say Italy previously said it could help support the police. It appears Indonesia will be the heavy hitter in the ISF.
Azerbaijan has said that as a founding member of the Board, it “supports the goals and objectives of the Board of Peace. In the future, Azerbaijan may consider participating in investment projects in Gaza through the Board of Peace.” Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan was at the meeting and said Ankara supports Gaza. Hungary’s leader also attended.
Turkish media covered the Board of Peace meeting and appears to take it seriously. It covered the countries that will contribute troops and the billions pledged to the Board. UAE’s Al-Ain media also covered the meeting, noting that the UAE will contribute to the $1.2 billion to the Board. Egypt has said it is committed to peace in Gaza and continues to reject the displacement of Palestinians in the enclave.
The coordinator of the Peace Council, Nikolay Mladenov, also announced on Thursday that the door to membership was opened to establish a police force in the Gaza Strip that would be independent of Hamas's influence, Al-Ain noted.
The head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, Ali Shaath, also affirmed the work to restore security in Gaza “under one authority and one weapon,” and to build the foundations for a sustainable peace in the sector, a separate report said.
It is clear from the extensive coverage of the meeting that this is a momentous occasion and that many countries believe this is the way forward in Gaza. For Trump, the ability to bring together so many leaders and officials from so many countries showcases US influence.
It also shows how Trump’s foreign policy doctrine appeals to countries outside Europe. This has led to concern in Europe about the US commitment.
Many countries that attended find that they can work with the Trump administration. This is a major shift in terms of the US approach to the world order. Many reports from Davos and the Munich conference focused on how the world order of the last few decades is largely vanishing.
The Board of Peace meeting is another waypoint on this shift in US strategy under the Trump administration. The road ahead in Gaza is expected to be hard, and it will prove the first major test for this approach.

Moroccan court sentences 19 soccer fans to prison over hooliganism at chaotic Africa Cup final
A Moroccan court has sentenced 19 soccer fans to up to a year in prison on charges of hooliganism stemming from a chaotic Africa Cup of Nations final that saw supporters try to storm the field
- Bookmark
A Moroccan court on Thursday sentenced 19 soccer fans to up to a year in prison on charges of hooliganism stemming from a chaotic Africa Cup of Nations final between Morocco and Senegal that saw supporters try to storm the field.
After a hearing that lasted more than five hours, the presiding judge ruled that the fans — 18 Senegalese and a French national — were guilty of more than half a dozen charges, including damaging sporting facilities and committing violence during a sporting event.
Eleven people were sentenced to one year in prison and handed a $550 fine. Four were sentenced to six months and given a $218 fine. The remaining four were sentenced to three months and a $130 fine, lawyer Naima El Guellaf told The Associated Press.
One defendant fainted upon hearing the sentences. Others refused to rise from the defendants’ bench when ordered to enter the small door leading to the holding cells. Family members, visibly shaken, insisted their relatives were innocent.
Attorneys said they plan to appeal the decision that they view as severe.
The defendants were arrested last month when outraged supporters tried to storm the pitch to protest a late penalty awarded to host Morocco during the final, which Senegal eventually won 1-0. They were held in custody for more than a month awaiting judgment.
During Thursday’s hearing, attended by Senegalese and French diplomats as well as relatives of several defendants, attorneys argued that the court lacked sufficient grounds to convict their clients.
The public prosecutor sought the maximum penalties against the fans, arguing that they had disrupted the orderly conduct of the match. He added that the damage was estimated at more than $476,719.
Morocco has long grappled with episodes of soccer-related hooliganism and courts in the North African nation routinely handle cases tied to such incidents. However, this case was unusual as it involved only foreign nationals.
The sentences marked the latest development stemming from a final that prompted senior officials in both countries to urge peace and fraternity amid social media tensions and a surge in what Moroccan rights groups described as “hate speech.”
Last month, CAF, the African soccer body, issued $1 million in fines and bans against Senegal and Morocco over the tumultuous game. Morocco announced it plans to appeal the decision, seeing the sanctions as disproportionate to the incidents.
The game was marred by Senegalese players walking off the pitch protesting a penalty awarded to Morocco in stoppage time. Outraged Senegalese supporters threw chairs onto the field and battled with stewards before police arrived.
The match and its outcome prompted senior officials in both countries reinforce diplomatic and economic ties they described as “strong and historic,” seeking to prevent the game from straining bilateral relations.
The Senegalese prime minister visited Morocco and signed agreements aimed at boosting investments in sectors like agriculture and mining. The two African nations are important economic partners. Heavily indebted, Senegal is seeking investors and Morocco is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars in the West African nation’s economy.

British Police Examine Epstein’s Use of U.K. Airports and Other Lines of Inquiry

Several British police forces are examining the logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private jet, nicknamed the “Lolita Express,” amid concerns the convicted sex offender may have trafficked women through U.K. airports.
Bedfordshire Police told TIME it “is reviewing materials published as part of the DOJ Disclosures Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, in relation to private flights in and out of London Luton Airport.”
A spokesperson for Essex Police confirmed similar investigations were underway, telling TIME: “We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of [London] Stansted Airport.”
Emails released in the most recent drop of files show Epstein discussing traveling to and from Stansted in 2012.
In one email chain titled “Paris/London train,” which references Stansted, a sender, whose name has been redacted, tells Epstein: “If you come via private, I'll need photo copies emailed to me of passport and U.S. visa, I fwd [forward] to U.K. immigration... once Boeing is
ready to depart she is escorted to aircraft.”
Another email sent to Epstein references a flight to Luton Airport in 2018.
Highlighting the coordinated efforts among the authorities, the West Midlands Police force is also looking at the private flights in and out of Birmingham Airport, following the publication of the Epstein files, a spokesperson told TIME.
A spokesperson from Police Scotland confirmed that while it has “not received any report or complaint in relation” to Epstein’s jet using Edinburgh Airport, it would be “keen to speak to anyone with information.”
Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has voiced deep concern over Epstein's frequent travel in and out of the U.K.
“How the flights were allowed to continue should have been fully investigated,” he wrote in an op-ed for the New Statesman last week. “The evidence suggests some in the U.K. were complicit in trafficking. This demands a full inquiry.”
He did not specify who may have been “complicit.”
Appearing in the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing, nor is being listed on the flight logs.
Speaking before news of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday morning, Brown said he had been “told privately that the investigations related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights.” He claimed “at least one” of Epstein's messages about private flights to the U.K. was linked to Andrew. “I have asked the police to look at this as part of the new inquiry,” he said.
TIME has contacted the relevant authorities for further information.
Separate to Andrew, Brown highlighted emails sent to and from Epstein concerning “the logistics of registering trafficked girls for English-as-a-foreign-language courses, as a route to obtaining U.S. visas.” He argued: “We need to know if and to what extent this was also happening in the U.K.”
Additionally, Surrey Police announced on Wednesday that, following a batch of Epstein files released in December, it had become aware of “a redacted report alleging non-recent human trafficking and sexual assaults on a minor in Virginia Water, Surrey, between 1994-1996.” The force is encouraging “anyone with information in relation to these allegations” to make contact.
Another police investigation is currently underway regarding Peter Mandelson, the former U.K. ambassador to the U.S., for alleged misconduct in public office offences.
In one resurfaced email, Mandelson appeared to tell Epstein he would lobby other government officials in an effort to reduce a tax on bankers’ bonuses. In another, he appeared to have forwarded an internal government report to Epstein which showed ways the U.K. might raise funds after the 2008 financial crisis. He has not been charged.

Annual productivity bulletin 2026
This year’s productivity bulletin has been released, and shows that Australia’s multifactor productivity, which measures how well labour and capital combine to produce outputs, declined by 0.5% in 2024-25, falling below the 20-year average.
Here are some visual breakdowns.
Alex Robson, Deputy Chair of the Productivity Commission says "unfortunately, the most recent ABS data shows that Australia’s MFP has declined over the 12 months to June 2025".
"At an industry level, agriculture, forestry and fishing led MFP growth at 10.4% over the last year. Mining saw its fifth consecutive year of declining MFP and had the largest fall of any industry in 2024-25 at 3.2%. There are many possible reasons for Australia’s recent poor track record of MFP growth," he says.
"One possible reason is slowing accumulation of human capital – while our labour force continues to grow, we also need a skilled workforce that can adapt to changes and meet employer demands."

Fintech Clear Street withdraws US IPO filing amid market volatility
Wall Street broker Clear Street has withdrawn its registration statement for a U.S. listing, as heightened bearish sentiments on financial and software stocks now extend to the new listings market.
Last week, Clear Street had delayed its IPO plans, citing "market conditions". This had followed a massive slashing of its targeted raise.
Disruption fears from AI-first offerings have been fuelling broad market selloffs, with shares of Wall Street brokerages hit last week after a selloff in software and IT stocks earlier this month.
Several companies have downsized or postponed their U.S. initial public offerings in 2026, as market volatility, valuation scrutiny and weak peer performance weighed on the new listings pipeline.
Last week, Brazilian fintech Agibank downsized its issue size by more than 50% and currently trades below its IPO price.
Blackstone-backed Liftoff Mobile, which also postponed its IPO plans earlier this month, refiled for a U.S. listing on Tuesday just hours after withdrawing an earlier plan.
The whipsawing nature of listing manoeuvres underscores the anxiety gripping capital markets.
While the year started with fears that AI-exuberance was fuelling an equities bubble, the nascent technology has since evolved into a disruptive force with entire sectors seeing selloffs sparked by product launches from AI-first startups.
Founded in 2018, Clear Street started as a prime brokerage platform and has since expanded into other businesses, including investment banking.
According to its IPO prospectus, the company expected net revenue to have risen to between $US1.04 billion and $US1.06 billion in 2025, from $US463.6 million a year earlier.
The withdrawal of its listing plan reflects the renewed challenges faced by companies aiming to tap the public markets, after U.S. trade policy and partisan gridlock caused hiccups last year in the long-awaited IPO comeback.

As electric car prices fall, will affordability win over drivers?
The affordability of electric cars has been one of the biggest sticking points holding back the energy transition.
But with the cheapest EV coming to Australia this year costing just $26,000 — about the same as its petrol equivalent — the landscape has shifted dramatically.
You can read the full report from climate reporter Jo Lauder below:
QBE Insurance CEO comments
QBE CEO Andrew Horton says the results out today have exceeded the financial plan for the year.
"The group’s combined operating ratio of 91.9% tracked ahead of our plan, and improved notably from 93.1% in the prior year. The result was supported by catastrophic costs comfortably below allowance," he said.
"Investment returns remained robust, with total investment income of $1.6 billion or a return of 4.9%.
"Collectively with our underwriting performance we generated significant value for shareholders in the year, with a Group adjusted return on equity of 19.8%, QBE's highest in over a decade, and an improvement from 18.2% in the prior year.
"This supported a 22 Australian cents increase in the 2025 dividend per share to 109 Australian cents relative to the year prior."
Strong results for QBE Insurance
Global insurance company QBE has released its financial results to December 2025, coming in better than expected.
Here are the main takeaways:
- The net profit after tax was $2.16 billion, compared to $1.8b the year prior. This is an increase of 21%
- The statutory insurance operating result was $2.2b, compared to $1.8b the year prior
- Net investment income was $1.7b, compared with $1.3b the year prior
- Gross written premium increased by 7%
On the agenda
More results are expected today.
Eyes will be on ANZ and QBE Insurance as they release their half yearly financial results to December 2025.
Other big names to look out for are
- Guzman y Gomez
- Latitude Group
- Mineral Resources
- Telix Pharmaceuticals

As the Middle East stands on the brink of escalation with Iran, it's natural for frightened folks in Israel to ruminate on the relationship between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu. The president and the prime minister are close enough that Netanyahu might just help tip the U.S. towards a new war – or not. What happens now matters a great deal for Israel: not only as a potential battlefield, but at the ballot box.

From demanding Israel's president grant the prime minister a pardon, to a potential escalation with Iran, how much harder can Trump campaign for Netanyahu to win Israel's elections, due later this year? But despite the trajectory, a kerfuffle or worse could change the script

US threatens to leave International Energy Agency if net zero focus remains

- The US pressured the International Energy Agency to drop its net zero agenda within a year, threatening US withdrawal. US Secretary Wright called net zero a "destructive illusion".
- The IEA ministerial meeting concluded without a final communique. While many ministers stressed climate action, the chair's summary downplayed net zero references.
- IEA Director Birol stated the agency would continue using "multiple scenarios," including those showing fossil fuel demand growth and net zero pathways, with future content undecided.

PARIS - The United States stepped up pressure on the International Energy Agency on Feb 19 to drop net zero from its agenda, giving it a year to do so or risk Washington exiting the organisation.
Speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the 52-year-old agency should return to its founding mission of ensuring energy security.
The Paris-based IEA was created to coordinate responses to major disruptions of supplies after the 1973 oil crisis, but it has broadened its focus to include renewable energy and net zero goals under executive director Fatih Birol.
“The US will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda,” Mr Wright said in a news conference, calling net zero a “destructive illusion”.
“But if the IEA is not able to bring itself back to focusing on the mission of energy honesty, energy access and energy security, then sadly we would become an ex-member of the IEA,” he added.
The net zero emissions target is crucial to meet the Paris climate agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C from pre-industrial levels.
But Mr Wright, a former fracking executive, said there was a “0.0 per cent chance” that net zero would be achieved.
Dutch Deputy Prime Minister Sophie Hermans, who chaired the two-day meeting, told AFP that the IEA has the task to provide governments “with all scenarios” – including net zero – so they can make informed decisions.
“I think we have to know what are the consequences of choices that you make or don’t make,” she said.
The gathering wrapped up without a final communique for the first time since 2017, releasing instead a “chair’s summary”.
The text says a “large majority” of ministers “stressed the importance of the energy transition to combat climate change and highlighted the global transition to net zero”.
But it only mentions “net zero” once and makes much fewer references to climate change and renewables than the communique that was issued afer the 2024 ministerial meeting.
US ‘undecided’ over IEA leadership
The IEA produces monthly reports on oil demand and supply as well as annual world energy outlooks that include data on the growth of solar and wind energy, among other analyses.
Mr Wright praised Mr Birol for reinserting in November 2025’s annual outlook a Current Policies Scenario in which oil and gas demand would grow in the next decades. That scenario had been dropped for the past five years.
But the report still included a scenario where the world reaches net zero emissions by mid-century.
In a closing press conference, Mr Birol said the IEA would “continue to have multiple scenarios” that look at investments, capital needs and resulting emissions from all of them.
But he also said he had yet to talk to colleagues about what would go into the next annual outlook which will be published later this year.
“We have not yet even thought about this, to be honest with you, this is a bit (of) a long term process,” Mr Birol said.
Mr Birol’s current four-year term ends in 2027, but Mr Wright demured when asked who he would like to head the IEA, which has over 30 member nations.
“We remain today undecided or neutral on who the leadership is. We care about the mission much more than the individual leaders,” the US energy chief said. AFP

Kessel Run Launches Program for ‘Next-Gen’ Air Operations Center

The Air Force’s Kessel Run software factory is launching an effort to create the “next generation” of the service’s Air Operations Centers, which command, control, and coordinate aircraft movements around the globe.
In the Feb. 18 program announcement, Kessel Run indicated it wants to incorporate artificial intelligence, machine learning, data fusion, and cloud-based software—the same technologies that are reshaping entire industries today.
The goal here is to enhance planners’ ability to synthesize and visualize the flight, intelligence, and threat data pouring into AOCs around the clock and to help leaders make better, faster decisions.
The goal is to release a request for information from industry later this month, starting a process that will end with a contract award targeted for June 2027, the announcement states.
The Air Force treats its 21 AOCs as weapon systems with the official designation AN/USQ-163 Falconer. The current AOC sustainment and modernization contract, a $374 million deal awarded to SAIC in 2022, runs out in summer 2027.
The AOC system consists of multiple software programs that acquire and present intelligence and sensor data to hundreds or even thousands of Airmen, who in turn use the system for command and control: identifying targets, creating Air Tasking Orders, assessing actions, and more.
The fielded version of the Falconer AOC system is Increment 10.1. A suite of upgrades, first referred to as 10.2 and now called Block 20, started years ago, with the Air Force first relying on contractors for the new software then moving much of the work in-house to software factories like Kessel Run.
At the heart of Block 20 is Kessel Run’s signature effort, the Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite or KRADOS, according to the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test & Evaluation. KRADOS is cloud-based and combines different software programs for things like planning refueling ops, fighter and bomber movements, and targeting options into one unified picture that looks like a website. It has already started rolling out to AOCs, and Air Force budget documents state that improvements and further integrations are in the works.
That’s supplemented by a program called AppTX, which transitions existing software applications to cloud computing.
According to Air Force budget documents, work on that front is progressing to a common baseline that provides commanders with a consolidated operational picture, a “single pane of glass” integrating multiple software programs onto one screen, negating the need to switch between multiple monitors.
The “Next-Generation” AOC program Kessel Run announced Feb. 18 doesn’t mention Block 20 by name but notes that with the current contract with SAIC running out, “as we look to the future, we are seeking to build upon these efforts and identify new and emerging technologies that can further enhance the AOC’s capabilities,” suggesting the program may be separate from Block 20.
The announcement lists four areas Kessel Run is particularly interested in:
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning “to accelerate decision-making”
- Data fusion and visualization from multiple sources
- Advanced cybersecurity measures
- Cloud-native architectures
Challenges contractors will have to reckon with include growing cyber threats and integrating legacy systems into new ones, the announcement also notes.
The timeline for the new program is relatively quick by Pentagon standards—though perhaps not as fast as many software developers are accustomed to:
- Request for Information released in February 2026
- Industry engagement and feedback in March 2026
- Draft Request for Proposal released in August 2026
- Final Request for Proposal released in November 2026
- Contract award in June 2027

The secret operation to arrest Andrew

The secret operation to arrest Andrew
The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has taken the world by surprise.
But behind closed doors, senior officers at Thames Valley Police will have been methodically planning the operation for days.
Having assessed the misconduct in public office complaint against the former duke and considered the available evidence, the police officer in charge of the investigation would have applied for a search warrant.
They would have needed to persuade a magistrate or district judge that it was necessary to raid Andrew’s former home in Windsor and his current one on the Sandringham Estate.
Once they had been given legal approval, they would have had to plan the raid and arrest, while ensuring the details were kept confidential.
The London Telegraph understands neither Buckingham Palace nor the King were given prior notice of the impending arrest.
About 20 officers from Thames Valley Police, supported by their colleagues from the Norfolk Constabulary, were involved in the raid.
They drove more than 200 kilometres from the police headquarters in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, to the village of Wolferton, on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.
The journey probably took about three hours, and the convoy of unmarked police cars arrived at Wood Farm shortly after 8am British time.
‘Confie op’
One former officer explained that the detectives selected for the “confie op” (confidential operation) are unlikely to have been given the details beforehand.
He explained: “The team would have simply been told to report to the station in the early hours. They may have even been told to hand over their mobile phones before being given the final briefing, setting out where they were going and what they were doing.”
Unlike the raid that was carried out on Lord Mandelson’s property after revelations about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at the scene and taken straight in for questioning.
The arresting officer would have read out the standard warning given to all suspects who are taken into custody: “You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court.”
The former duke would then have been placed in the back of a police car and driven away for a formal interview.
Once at the police station, he would be checked in at the custody suite by a sergeant, who would confirm the grounds for arrest were lawful before authorising his detention.
Like any other person in custody, he would then have been searched for anything that could be used to harm himself or anyone else, and required to hand over his phone, any jewellery, watch, belt, or tie.
He would also probably have been subjected to a risk assessment to establish whether there were any medical conditions or alcohol or drug use to ensure he was afforded appropriate care in custody.
At this point, officers would have explained his rights, including the right to free and independent legal advice, the right to notify someone of his arrest and the codes of practice under which he was being detained.
Detainees are then usually fingerprinted before being led to a cell pending an interview.
A typical cell will be “austere”, according to former police officers, with a toilet possibly screened off inside, and a mattress raised about 30 centimetres off the floor.
At this point, he may have been offered a cup of tea or food if required.
Mountbatten-Windsor would have been allowed some time to talk to his lawyer before the police interview.
The interviews by the investigating officers may be staggered depending on what he says and any other tandem operations that the police team has carried out.
It is thought unlikely that Mountbatten-Windsor would have been handcuffed at any stage because there would be no history of violence or concerns that he could seek to escape.

CIA knew about plans to sabotage Nord Stream pipeline — report

US intelligence knew about Ukrainian plans to sabotage the Nord Stream pipelines far earlier than previously reported, according to reports in the German media.
In a news report on Thursday, Der Spiegel said CIA officers met with Ukrainian operatives in spring 2022 to discuss plans for destroying the pipelines that carried Russian natural gas to Germany along the Baltic Sea seabed.
Ukrainian sources told the magazine that American officials initially reacted positively to the idea and engaged in talks about technical aspects of the operation.
Later, however, the US intelligence reversed course and warned against proceeding.
A CIA spokesperson rejected the claims, telling Der Spiegel they were "completely and utterly false." The magazine stood by its report, citing credible information from multiple sources.
The sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in September 2022 caused extensive damage to the infrastructure connecting Russia and Germany beneath the Baltic Sea. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied involvement.
Some reports have claimed the operation was approved by then-army chief Valery Zaluzhny without informing President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Covert operations and sabotage
German authorities have identified a suspect from the sabotage team as Serhiy Kuznetsov. He was arrested in Italy and extradited to Germany in late November to stand trial.
According to German media reports, he is a former agent of Ukraine's intelligence service, the SBU, and belonged to a unit specialising in covert operations and sabotage.
Authorities revealed his identity after investigating the rental of a yacht named Andromeda, which served as the operational base for the mission.
Investigators determined the team traveled to Germany and rented the yacht using forged identity documents.
Kuznetsov is believed to have been part of a seven-member team that included divers, assistants, a captain, and a medic.
Authorities suspect he acted as a coordinator rather than one of the operatives who physically attached the explosives.

Tariffs paid by midsize US companies tripled last year, a JPMorganChase Institute study shows
WASHINGTON (AP) — Tariffs paid by midsize U.S. businesses tripled over the course of past year, new research tied to one of America’s leading banks showed on Thursday — more evidence that President Donald Trump ‘s push to charge higher taxes on imports is causing economic disruption.
The additional taxes have meant that companies that employ a combined 48 million people in the U.S. — the kinds of businesses that Trump had promised to revive — have had to find ways to absorb the new expense, by passing it along to customers in the form of higher prices, employing fewer workers or accepting lower profits.
“That’s a big change in their cost of doing business,” said Chi Mac, business research director of the JPMorganChase Institute, which published the analysis Thursday. “We also see some indications that they may be shifting away from transacting with China and maybe toward some other regions in Asia.”
The research does not say how the additional costs are flowing through the economy, but it indicates that tariffs are being paid by U.S. companies. The study is part of a growing body of economic analyses that counter the administration’s claims that foreigners pay the tariffs.
The JPMorganChase Institute report used payments data to look at businesses that might lack the pricing power of large multinational companies to offset tariffs, but may be small enough to quickly change supply chains to minimize exposure to the tax increases. The companies tended to have revenues between $10 million and $1 billion with fewer than 500 employees, a category known as “middle market.”
AP’s Lisa Dwyer reports on research showing Tariffs are hitting the bottom line.
The analysis suggests that the Trump administration’s goal of becoming less directly reliant on Chinese manufacturers has been occurring. Payments to China by these companies were 20% below their October 2024 levels, but it’s unclear whether that means China is simply routing its goods through other countries or if supply chains have moved.
The authors of the analysis emphasized in an interview that companies are still adjusting to the tariffs and said they plan to continue studying the issue.
White House spokesman Kush Desai called the analysis “pointless” and said it didn’t “change the fact that President Trump was right.” The study showed that U.S. companies are paying tariffs that the president had previously claimed would be paid by foreign entities.
Trump defended his tariffs during a trip to Georgia on Thursday while touring Coosa Steel, a company involved in steel processing and distribution. The president said he couldn’t believe the Supreme Court would soon decide on the legality of some of his tariffs, given his belief that the taxes were helping U.S. manufacturers.
“The tariffs are the greatest thing to happen to this country,” Trump said.
The president imposed a series of tariffs last year for the ostensible goal of reducing the U.S. trade imbalance with other countries, so that America was not longer importing more than it exports. But trade data published Thursday by the Census Bureau showed that the trade deficit climbed last year by $25.5 billion to $1.24 trillion. The president on Wednesday posted on social media that he expected there would be a trade surplus “during this year.”
The Trump administration has been adamant that the tariffs are a boon for the economy, businesses, and workers. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, lashed out on Wednesday at research by the New York Federal Reserve showing that nearly 90% of the burden for Trump’s tariffs fell on U.S. companies and consumers.
“The paper is an embarrassment,” Hassett told CNBC. “It’s, I think, the worst paper I’ve ever seen in the history of the Federal Reserve system. The people associated with this paper should presumably be disciplined.”
Trump increased the average tariff rate to 13% from 2.6% last year, according to the New York Fed researchers. He declared that tariffs on some items such as steel, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities were in the national security interest of the country. He also declared an economic emergency to bypass Congress and impose a baseline tax on goods from much of the world in April 2025 at an event he called “Liberation Day.”
The high rates provoked a financial market panic, prompting Trump to walk back his rates and then engage in talks with multiple countries that led to a set of new trade frameworks. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on whether Trump surpassed his legal authority by declaring an economic emergency.
Trump was elected in 2024 on his promise to tame inflation, but his tariffs have contributed to voter frustration over affordability. While inflation has not spiked during Trump’s term thus far, hiring slowed sharply and a team of academic economists estimate that consumer prices were roughly 0.8 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be.

Judge declares 4 men wrongly accused of 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders innocent
Judge declares 4 men wrongly accused of 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders innocent
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — For more than three decades, the four men and their families had insisted they were innocent of one of Austin’s most gruesome and notorious crimes: the 1991 rape and murder of four teenage girls at a yogurt shop that was set on fire.
No one listened. Not when Robert Springsteen was sent to death row. Not when Michael Scott was sentenced to life in prison. Or when Forrest Welborn and Maurice Pierce, though never convicted, struggled through life under dark clouds of suspicion that they were murderers.
Their pleas were finally heard Thursday. A judge formally declared the men innocent after an emotional court hearing where prosecutors apologized and admitted they were wrongly accused of a crime that haunted the city for decades. Investigators determined last year that the murders were committed by a previously unknown culprit who died in 1999.
Scott and Welborn sat in the crowded courtroom packed with family members to hear state District Judge Dayna Blazey formally tell them “you are innocent.” She called her order “an obligation to the rule of law and the obligation to the dignity of the individual.”
The hearing included lengthy statements from the men and their families about the struggles of incarceration, broken relationships, constant harassment by investigators and homelessness.
Springsteen did not attend. Through tears, Marisa Pierce addressed her father, who died in 2010 in a confrontation with police after a traffic stop.
“Daddy, you have your name back,” she said. “The world knows what you were trying to say all along.”
Killings shocked Austin and confounded investigators
Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, ages 17 and 15, were bound, gagged and shot in the head at the “I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt” store where two of them worked. The building was set on fire.
Investigators chased thousands of leads and several false confessions before the four men, who were teenagers when the girls were killed, were arrested in late 1999.
Springsteen and Scott were convicted based largely on confessions they insisted were coerced by police. Both convictions were overturned in the mid-2000s.
Welborn was charged but never tried after two grand juries refused to indict him. Pierce spent three years in jail before the charges were dismissed and he was released.
Prosecutors wanted to try Springsteen and Scott again, but a judge ordered the charges dismissed in 2009 when new DNA tests that were unavailable in 1991 and the previous trials revealed another male suspect.
“Let us not forgot that Robert Springsteen could be dead right now, executed at the hands of the state of Texas,” Springsteen attorney Amber Farrelly said.
In a statement his attorney read in court, Welborn said he lost friends, struggled to keep jobs and was at one time homeless. Scott testified that his arrest, conviction and prison sentence ultimately broke up his family.
“I lost my family. I lost my youth. My daughter was 3 years old when I was arrested. We had just celebrated our first wedding anniversary. I lost the chance to build a family,” Scott said. “Every day I have carried the weight of a crime I did not commit.”
The formal declaration of innocence could also be a key step for the men and their families if they seek financial compensation for years they spent incarcerated or struggled to live under a cloud of suspicion.
“My son’s name has finally been cleared after more than 25 years of being called the monster, the murderer and everything else,” said Phil Scott, Michael Scott’s father. “Son, be proud.”
Connection to a new suspect revealed
After Scott and Springsteen were released, the case effectively went cold until 2025, when an HBO documentary series attracted new public attention to the unsolved crime.
Then investigators made a stunning announcement last September: New DNA science and reviews of old ballistics evidence pointed to Robert Eugene Brashers as the sole killer.
Since 2018, authorities had used advanced DNA evidence to link Brashers to the strangulation death of a South Carolina woman in 1990, the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee and the shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri in 1998.
The link to the Austin case came when a DNA sample taken from under Ayers’ fingernail came back as a match to Brashers from the 1990 killing.
Austin investigators also found that Brashers had been arrested at a border checkpoint near El Paso two days after the yogurt shop killings. In his stolen car was a pistol that matched the caliber used to kill one of the girls in Austin.
Police also noted similarities in the yogurt shop case to Brashers’ other crimes: The victims were tied up with their own clothing, sexually assaulted and some crime scenes were set on fire.
Brashers died in 1999 when he shot himself during an hourslong standoff with police at a motel in Kennett, Missouri.
“Over 25 years ago, the state prosecuted four innocent men ... (for) one of the worst crimes Austin has ever seen,” Travis County First Assistant District Attorney Trudy Strassburger said. “We could not have been more wrong.”

Stacked design panel approves Trump’s ‘beautiful’ White House ballroom

Stacked design panel approves Trump’s ‘beautiful’ White House ballroom
Washington: A design panel recently stacked with Donald Trump loyalists has approved the president’s White House ballroom, taking it a step closer to reality despite overwhelming opposition from the public submissions.
The Commission of Fine Arts voted 6-0, with one abstention, to approve the ballroom at a meeting on Thursday, Washington time, after reviewing updated plans and renders.
“This is a facility that is desperately needed for over 150 years, and it’s beautiful,” said chairman Rodney Mims Cook Jr, a former commissioner whom Trump returned to the agency last month.
Trump fired all six previous members of the CFA in October, then left the agency vacant until January, when he appointed seven new members - including his 26-year-old executive assistant Chamberlain Harris, who is not known to have any arts experience.
The panel approved the plans despite an avalanche of opposition from members of the public and concerned parties, including historic and conservation organisations.
Long-serving secretary Thomas Luebke said the commission received more than 2000 messages in just a week about the ballroom project. “The summary of it was overwhelmingly in opposition - over 99 per cent,” he said.
Those concerns largely involved the “illegal demolition” of the former White House East Wing in October, Luebke said, as well as the inappropriate scale of the new ballroom that would dwarf the White House.
People were also worried about the project ignoring historic preservation principles, the lack of transparency about who was funding the ballroom, and “a fundamental miscarriage of democratic principles”, he added.
Luebke also read out an unnamed letter of support, which said the White House’s current provisions for large ceremonies involving foreign heads of state were insufficient.
“We have a tent. Currently, people are omitted due to lack of space,” the person wrote. “The United States is on the world stage. Modernisation to have America be competitive in the eyes of world leaders is not a bad thing.”
Public condemnation did not stop the panel quickly proceeding to approve the designs following a presentation by architect Shalom Baranes and landscape architect Rick Parisi.
The 1000-person ballroom building is of similar height to the White House residence, although the footprint - 90,000 square feet - is considerably larger.
Harris, whose main job is formally the deputy director of Oval Office operations, said the building “isn’t that big by ballroom standards”, and the size was consistent with the residence.
“This is sort of like the greatest country in the world, it’s the greatest house in the world, and we want it to be the greatest ballroom in the world,” she said.
The CFA panel’s decision does not represent the end of the process. The ballroom must also clear the National Capital Planning Commission, which is due to meet in early March to vote on the project.
That commission has also been stacked with Trump loyalists. Its chairman is Will Scharf - formerly a Trump lawyer, now White House staff secretary, who is regularly pictured handing Trump executive orders.
Meanwhile, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit in December to stop the ballroom. The judge in the case has so far refused to issue an injunction while the planning process is underway.
Cook Jr, the CFA chairman, said while he respected the National Trust, it had not stopped then president Harry Truman gutting the interior of the White House in the 1940s and 1950s. “Why the shouting now?” he said. “It seems unusual to me.”
Trump wants the ballroom to be finished before his term ends at the start of 2029. In a post on Truth Social, he thanked the panel for its decision. “Great accolades were paid to the building’s beauty and scale,” he said.
Even sceptics of the ballroom project have accepted the need for a bigger venue space for the president to host large, formal functions with visiting world leaders. Frequently - as was the case with a state dinner with then prime minister Scott Morrison in 2019 - guests are seated in outdoor tents on the White House grounds.
However, Trump’s ballroom has been tarred by accusations of improper process and lack of transparency. The cost - which is being covered by large corporate donations - has doubled to $US400 million, while the historic East Wing was bulldozed in October without any planning permits.
The White House has pointed out numerous presidents have modified or rebuilt the property. It says Trump’s ballroom is “a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions from commanders-in-chief to keep the executive residence as a beacon of American excellence”.
Trump, a property developer before he entered politics, has also set in train a number of other Washington building projects, including the construction of a 250-foot triumphal arch nicknamed the “Arc de Trump”.

Tucker Carlson claims detained at airport in Israel, video tells different story

Conservative American commentator Tucker Carlson said Israeli security officials at Ben Gurion Airport detained him for questioning, but video circulating Thursday appeared to contradict that account.
In the footage, Carlson is seen signing a document, smiling, embracing what appears to be a security staff member, posing for a photo and leaving the area without visible distress.
Carlson claimed Wednesday that security personnel at Israel’s main international airport confiscated his passport and “hauled” him and his producer into a questioning room after he interviewed U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee.
“Men who identified themselves as airport security took our passports, hauled our executive producer into a side room and then demanded to know what we spoke to Ambassador Huckabee about,” Carlson told the Daily Mail. “It was bizarre. We’re now out of the country.” A photo posted on Carlson’s account on X showed him with his business partner, Neil Patel, in front of Israeli flags.
The U.S. State Department and the U.S. ambassador in Israel disputed Carlson’s account, saying he underwent routine questioning.
“It is inaccurate to say that Israel was prepared to allow Tucker to enter the country solely for the purpose of the interview,” the State Department said in response to an inquiry from ynet. “The only involvement of the U.S. Embassy with Israel regarding his visit was coordinating the landing of his private aircraft to facilitate a smooth visit. Tucker chose to enter the country for only a few hours and depart. Tucker received the same positive treatment afforded to any visitor to Israel.”
Israeli authorities also denied Carlson’s claims. The Israel Airports Authority said in a statement: “Contrary to the reports, Tucker Carlson and his entourage were not detained, delayed, or interrogated. Mr. Carlson and his party were politely asked a few routine questions, in accordance with standard procedures applied to many travelers. The conversation took place in a separate room within the VIP lounge solely to protect their privacy and to avoid conducting such a discussion in public. No unusual incident occurred, and the Israel Airports Authority firmly rejects any other claim.”
Carlson, one of Israel’s most vocal critics within the Republican Party, has at times made statements widely condemned as antisemitic. He traveled to Israel at Huckabee’s invitation after criticizing the ambassador on his YouTube program and accusing him of failing to ensure adequate protection for Christians in Israel.
“Instead of talking about me, why don't you come talk to me?” Huckabee wrote to Carlson on X. The podcast host responded that he would come to interview him. The interview ultimately took place at Ben Gurion Airport.

Shia LaBeouf accused of hate crime in Mardi Gras brawl
Actor was released from jail Tuesday and is due in court March 19

One of the alleged victims of Shia LaBeouf’s Mardi Gras meltdown has accused the actor of targeting him in a hate crime.
Jeffrey Damnit, who was born Jeffrey Klein, is asking prosecutors to upgrade charges against LaBeouf, 39, who currently faces two counts of simple battery after he was arrested for allegedly attacking two bartenders just after midnight Tuesday in New Orleans.
Hours before video was taken of the Transformers star fighting and being restrained on city streets, Damnit said he ran into the actor around 5 p.m. Monday, when LaBeouf allegedly knocked him over. He recalled to The Hollywood Reporter, “Then he turned around screaming, ‘Don’t you f***ing push me. I’ll kill you.’ I hadn’t touched him.”
Damnit said he tried to deescalate the situation, but LaBeouf allegedly then shoved a finger in his face and called him a homophobic slur.
In a Wednesday interview with The Guardian, Damnit said that he was wearing mascara, eye shadow and lipstick when LaBeouf allegedly attacked him while screaming, “You’re a f***ing f****t.” Damnit shared a video with the outlet that showed LaBeouf being examined by first responders at the scene before glancing over at Damnit and again calling him a slur.
“Keep on calling me f****t,” Damnit was heard saying on the video, The Guardian reported. The outlet noted that in initial police reports, officers said that the controversial former child star spoke about his Catholic faith and was heard saying, “These f****ts put me in jail.”
However, the allegation that he was spewing homophobic slurs at his alleged victims was left out of the official charging paperwork. NOPD refused to comment further on The Independent’s request, citing the ongoing investigation.
Damnit, an actor who visits New Orleans several times a year, told local Fox affiliate WVUE that he wants LaBeouf to be charged with a hate crime.
“I mean, it’s a hate crime, right? You’re beating people up because somewhere in your mind their sexuality goes against what you think should get to live,” Damnit said. He did not immediately return The Independent’s request for comment.
Louisiana law allows state prosecutors to file hate crime charges in cases where victims were targeted “because of actual or perceived race, age, gender, sexual orientation.”
LaBeouf was released from jail Tuesday and is due back in court March 19. The actor has not commented publicly on the charges against him, but has shared cryptic posts on his X account since his arrest, including a message simply saying, “Free me.”

Donald Trump speaks out on Andrew arrest: ‘It’s a very sad thing’
- US President Donald Trump has spoken out on the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
- The disgraced royal was arrested Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein but was released later that evening under further investigation.
- Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to an appearance in Georgia, Trump said: “I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It’s very, very sad. To me, it’s a very sad thing.” He added that King Charles “who’s obviously coming to our country very soon”, is “a fantastic man, king”.
- On the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice, Trump said: “It's really interesting, because nobody used to speak about Epstein when he was alive, and now they speak, but I’m the one that can talk about it because I’ve been totally exonerated.
- He added, “I did nothing, in fact, the opposite. He was against me. He was fighting me in the election which I just found out throughout the last three million pages of documents.”

NASA's new boss is blasting Boeing and the space agency for Starliner's botched flight that left two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station

NASA’s new boss blasted Boeing and the space agency Thursday for Starliner’s botched flight that left two astronauts stuck for months at the International Space Station.
Administrator Jared Isaacman said poor leadership and decision-making at Boeing led to Starliner’s troubles. He also blamed NASA managers for failing to intervene and get Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams back more quickly.
The two test pilots, now retired from NASA, spent more than nine months at the station before catching a lift back with SpaceX last March.
Isaacman said Starliner’s problems must be better understood and fixed before any more astronauts strap in.
Isaacman upgraded the seriousness of Starliner's troubled astronaut debut, declaring it a “Type A mishap,” something that could endanger a crew. Both the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters also involved cultural and leadership missteps. It is a mistake that Starliner was not designated a serious mishap right from the start, Isaacman said, citing internal pressure to keep Boeing on board and flights on track.
“This is just about doing the right thing,” he said. “This is about getting the record straight.”
Thruster failures and other problems almost prevented Wilmore and Williams from reaching the space station following liftoff in 2024. The thruster analyses continue by Boeing.
“We almost did have a really terrible day," said NASA Associate Administrator Amit Kshatriya, referring to a potential loss of life.
Boeing said the report by NASA will help the company move forward in ensuring crew safety, and stressed that the Starliner program would continue.
There is no timeline for when Boeing can launch Starliner on a supply run, essentially another test flight to prove its safety before astronaut flights. The grounding leaves SpaceX as the only U.S. taxi service for astronauts.
“Boeing has made substantial progress on corrective actions for technical challenges we encountered and driven significant cultural changes across the team,” Boeing said in a statement.
Even before the troubled astronaut flight, Boeing was struggling with Starliner issues. The first test flight in 2019, without anyone on board, ended up in the wrong orbit and forced a repeat mission, which had its own difficulties.
NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX in 2014, in the wake of the space shuttles’ retirement, to ferry astronauts to and from the orbiting lab. Their contracts are worth billions. SpaceX just delivered its 13th crew to the space station for NASA since 2020.
Kshatriya said the space agency must do better moving forward.
“We have to own our part of this,” he said. As for Wilmore and Williams, “We failed them."

National Parks ditches reservation system that has been used to help control crowd sizes
‘Our national parks belong to the American people, and our priority is keeping them open and accessible,’ a Trump administration official said

Visitors to popular national parks will no longer be required to make reservations, a system historically used to manage crowd sizes in America's protected natural areas.
The National Parks Service announced on Wednesday that three parks — Arches, Glacier and Yosemite — will ditch their reservation requirements starting this summer.
The agency, which is part of the Interior Department, said the decision reflects officials’ desire to expand public access during peak visitation season.
“Our national parks belong to the American people, and our priority is keeping them open and accessible,” Kevin Lilly, the acting assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks said in a statement. “We’re expanding access where conditions allow and using targeted tools only where necessary to protect visitor safety, maintain emergency access and preserve these extraordinary places for future generations.”
In order to prepare for this change, the parks’ seasonal workforce will be bolstered, officials said.
Several national parks started implementing reservation systems during the Covid-19 Pandemic in an attempt to reduce crowd sizes and to protect the spaces from overuse, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The policy elicited sharply divided responses from stakeholders: nearby business owners decried it for discouraging travel, while some outdoor enthusiasts supported it as a way to manage foot and vehicle traffic.
“In our view, [timed-entry reservations] have really made a meaningful difference in people’s visitor experiences. It creates safer conditions, protects resources and typically helps with traffic issues,” Cassidy Jones, a visitation program manager with the National Parks Conservation Association, told SFGATE.
The policy change will impact three of the country’s most popular outdoor tourist destinations, which draw millions of visitors each year.
Arches National Park in Utah won’t implement a “time entry reservation system,” NPS announced. Visitors instead will be encouraged to arrive early, explore less-traveled areas and to “be flexible.”
Additionally, Montana’s Glacier National Park won’t require “park-wide vehicle” reservations in 2026. The park, however, “will continue targeted congestion management in high-demand corridors,” NPS said.
Yellowstone National Park in California, which saw some 4 million visitors in 2024, will also phase out its reservation requirements this year, including during the busiest months of the year.
“The park will rely on real-time traffic management measures, including temporary traffic diversions when parking areas reach capacity and deployment of additional seasonal staff to manage high-use areas,” officials said.
NPS noted that Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado will maintain its timed entry reservation system between May and October.
These adjustments are among multiple recent changes to the national parks system following President Donald Trump's inauguration last year.
In December, NPS revised its list of free entrance days, dropping Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth — two federal holidays that were added under President Joe Biden’s administration.
In their place, June 14 — which is both Flag Day and Trump’s birthday — has been included.
And in January, Trump officials directed national parks to remove or update signage addressing climate change and Native American history. Staff at more than a dozen locations across Texas, Colorado, Montana and Utah received orders to change such displays.
The directive aligns with Trump's March 2025 executive order, titled "Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” which aimed to purge "partisan ideology" from federal sites.
Meanwhile, the number of staff at the nation’s parks has significantly decreased. According to the Journal, NPS has lost roughly 25 percent of its permanent staff since Trump returned to office.

Ukraine, Austria agree to step up joint efforts to return Ukrainian children from Russia
According to Ukrinform, Stefanchuk shared details of the meeting on Facebook.
"We spoke about the security situation and the consequences of Russian attacks. Russia is deliberately destroying energy infrastructure and using the cold as a tool of pressure, trying to make living conditions for Ukrainians unbearable. I received assurances of continued support from Austria and its parliament," Stefanchuk said.
He confirmed that "Ukraine is open to effective negotiations, but our 'red lines' remain unchanged – territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence, and the right to determine our own path."
Both sides also addressed the issue of abducted Ukrainian children and agreed to strengthen joint efforts in this area.
Stefanchuk and Rosenkranz discussed humanitarian projects as well, including the reconstruction of Ukrainian schools and kindergartens as a concrete expression of solidarity by the Austrian people with Ukraine.
"Austria remains a reliable partner of Ukraine, and we are sincerely grateful for all the support provided, which has already exceeded EUR 350 million," Stefanchuk said.

US state sues Apple over child sex abuse images in iCloud
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- West Virginia is suing Apple, alleging iCloud enables storage and distribution of child sex abuse material, accusing Apple of shirking responsibility.
- Attorney-General McCuskey argues Apple's refusal to scan iCloud data, citing user privacy, inexcusably protects child predators, jeopardising children's safety.
- Apple prioritises safety with parental controls but fears scanning iCloud for CSAM risks "bulk surveillance" and privacy erosion for all users.

SAN FRANCISCO - The US state of West Virginia on Feb 19 said it is suing Apple over child sex abuse material people tuck away in its iCloud online storage service.
The suit filed by Attorney-General John Bohen McCuskey in a state court accuses the iPhone maker of letting iCloud be used to store and distribute such content, often referred to as child pornography.
Apple has been under pressure from some child safety advocates due to a decision several years ago not to jeopardise user privacy and security by allowing scanning of data stored in iCloud.
“Preserving the privacy of child predators is absolutely inexcusable,” Mr McCuskey said in a release.
Mr McCuskey argued that Apple has “shirked their responsibility to protect children under the guise of user privacy.”
In response to an AFP query, Apple countered that safety is a priority for the tech firm, which is constantly innovating to combat threats to users, especially children.
“All of our industry-leading parental controls and features are designed with the safety, security, and privacy of our users at their core,” an Apple spokesperson told AFP.
For example, a Communication Safety feature automatically intervenes on children’s devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop or live FaceTime video calls, the spokesperson added.
Apple opted not to allow scanning of photos stored in iCloud for child sex abuse, saying in a 2023 letter to an advocacy group that such a move brought the potential for unintended consequences.
“Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance,” Apple said in the letter.
“How can users be assured that a tool for one type of surveillance has not been reconfigured to surveil for other content such as political activity or religious persecution?” AFP

New chief of top intelligence watchdog revealed
The federal government has appointed a new chief for Australia’s top intelligence watchdog.
The attorney-general, Michelle Rowland, has just announced New South Wales Crime Commissioner Michael Barnes will take up the role of inspector-general of Intelligence and Security from April this year.
He’s replacing Christopher Jessup, whose five-year term is coming to an end.
It’s an important role – the inspector-general oversees and reviews Australia’s national intelligence agencies to make sure they don’t break the law or overstep any boundaries while doing their work.
Barnes has had a long career in the law, and the attorney-general says he’ll bring “extensive” experience to the job and ensure intelligence agencies continue to face “robust” scrutiny.
Full list of 11 Australian women with ISIS links trying to leave Syria revealed
The ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women connected to former Islamic State fighters in Syria who attempted to journey home to Australia this week
The group of 34 Australians, including 23 children, has been living in camps in Syria since the fall of the so-called caliphate, and some of those children were actually born behind the razor wire.
Some of the women are believed to have accompanied their husbands to the war zone, but others came with family and married IS fighters once they arrived. Some say they got stuck in Syria by accident.
Many of them have previously spoken to the ABC.
They left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in the hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
An official at the Al Roj camp said that when the group left, staff started dismantling their tents, and when the group unexpectedly returned, some had to bunk in together.
On Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke revealed one of the women is now the subject of a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO), potentially banning her from travelling to Australia for up to two years on national security grounds.
It is not clear who the woman subject to the TEO is.
Read the full story by Middle East correspondents Matthew Doran and Nick Dole, Cherine Yazbeck and Baderkhan Ahmad.
Hanson is capitalising on fear, Melissa McIntosh says
Liberal frontbencher Melissa McIntosh says Pauline Hanson's comments about the Muslim community have had an impact on the people in her electorate on the western edge of Sydney.
The One Nation leader has this week made comments about Muslims that have been labelled "cruel" and "divisive" by people across the political spectrum.
McIntosh told Sky News she thinks Hanson is capitalising on people's fear relating to the news of Australian women with IS ties returning home from Syria.
"They need to separate what's going on when it comes to the so-called ISIS brides and when it comes to immigration, the impacts that immigration more broadly has on communities like ours in Western Sydney," she said.
"So, these are two fundamentally different things that are getting caught up together and and Pauline Hanson is taking opportunity of that."
Sympathy for children stuck in camps but blame on parents: Watt
Labor frontbencher Murray Watt also dialled into ABC's Radio National Breakfast.
He said he had sympathy for the children stuck in the "distressing" situation of the camps in northern Syria, but laid the blame on their parents.
"It's a distressing situation that they've been placed in as a result of very bad decisions by their parents. We, of course, from a government perspective, you know, focus more than anything on the safety of Australians, and that explains the basis of our decisions that we've made about this group," he said.
"I do have sympathy for those children, and our government has sympathy for those children. But the decision to put the children in these situations was made by their parents. That's something that we can't change."
Duniam unsure who wrote leaked immigration policy
The shadow home affairs minister also continued to distance himself from an immigration policy that was leaked to the media.
Under the plan, entry to Australia for people from terror-declared areas such as Gaza and Somalia would be barred.
The ABC reported earlier this week the draft policy proposal was produced within former opposition leader Sussan Ley's office and was not signed off on by the shadow cabinet.
Jonathon Duniam said he had no clue who wrote the policy.
He said the working group had an "excellent" proposal that was due to be released, but was delayed in the wake of the Bondi terror attack .
Duniam says he's now, along with his colleagues, working to redraft the policy.
Risk of 'anyone', even children, returning from former IS-controlled region a concern: Duniam
Shadow Home Affairs Minister Jonathon Duniam dialled into ABC's Radio National Breakfast, where he was also asked about the group of Australian women and children stuck in Syria.
The cohort of 34 had attempted to leave the al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back.
Duniam was asked if the children should be subject to similar levels of concern and protection as demonstrated by former PM Scott Morrison when he repatriated eight orphaned children in 2019.
He said the situation was complex and there were risks associated with bringing anyone back from the region.
"So, we cannot ignore the risk associated with individuals, whether they be minors or indeed adults, when it comes to repatriating them here," he said.
"And indeed, when it comes to these minors, the temporary exclusion order regime does apply to individuals between the ages of 14 and 17, and some reports suggest that these aren't just infants, they are indeed inclusive of teenagers who would be more advanced in thinking and beliefs than perhaps a younger child."
Butler dismisses Coalition call to cancel passports for Australians with links to IS
The opposition has escalated its attack over the government's handling of the potential return of Australians linked to the Islamic State.
It has questioned why the cohort of 34 women and children was issued single-use passports and pointed to powers to refuse the documents.
But while Mark Butler agreed the power was there, the grounds for not approving a passport are "very specific".
"They're determined ultimately by our national security agencies," he says.
"I'm sure Angus Taylor knows that there are very strict constitutional limits on what any government, Labor or Liberal, is able to do in the area of citizenship and passports."
Liberal deputy Jane Hume said Australians deserved an explanation as to why one of the women was issued with a temporary order to delay their return, and others weren't.
Government reacts to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrest
Health Minister Mark Butler has provided the government's first reaction to the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
"As the king said, the law must follow its course. There's not much we can appropriately say about the potential for charges," he told Seven.
"But ... what a fall from grace. A man we knew for decades as Prince Andrew ... is just now a man in his 60s from Norfolk.
"I think all of our thoughts as human beings ... go to the girls and the women who were caught up in this hideous network of powerful men that Jeffrey Epstein pulled together.
"And we're starting to see some accountability for those awful years."
Deputy Liberal leader Jane Hume agreed, saying it was a reminder that "nobody is above the law".
"I think that this is an extremely disturbing fall from grace that we've seen from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The misconduct in public office is a very serious allegation," she says.
"We should let the full course of the law take its place."
'I support the dual mandate': Wilson backpedals on RBA call
Shadow Treasurer Tim Wilson has walked back his call to overhaul the Reserve Bank of Australia's twin focus on taming inflation and full employment.
In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, Wilson called for a rethink of the RBA's twin goals, which are to keep inflation between 2-3 per cent and unemployment low.
Wilson told the newspaper the RBA is "confused about what its core purpose is to do, and it should be to focus on reducing inflation".
But in a statement to the ABC, the Goldstein MP appears to have had a change of heart.
"I support the dual mandate. I support a review so the RBA gets it right because they've consistently failed at understanding the nature of inflation, and I don't support Jim Chalmers continuing to pour debt petrol on the inflation fire," Wilson says.
The treasurer has labelled Mr Wilson's initial comments to the SMH "reckless" and urged the Coalition to "urgently reconsider abandoning the dual mandate for the Reserve Bank".
Yesterday, Liberal deputy Jane Hume told Afternoon Briefing she backs a dual mandate.
"I have seen no reason why the dual mandate doesn't work."

European Commission should defend EU interests, not Ukraine’s — top Hungarian diplomat

BUDAPEST, February 19. /TASS/. Hungary urges the European Commission to defend the interests of EU member countries, not those of Ukraine, which blocked Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.
He welcomed the European Commission’s decision to discuss the issue during the Oil Coordination Group meeting due February 24 but suggested that the EU’s primary executive body should "act as the commission of Europe, and not of Ukraine."
In his opinion, the European Commission should demand that the Kiev government "complies with the EU association agreement which stipulates that Ukraine should not put energy security of any EU member country at risk."
On top of that, Szijjarto believes that the European Commission should "take seriously the EU’s rules on Russian oil imports," making Croatians understand that they cannot impede the delivery of Russian oil for Hungary and Slovakia by sea while the Druzhba pipeline remains offline.
According to Hungarian data, oil has not flowed through the Druzhba pipeline since January 27. Budapest believes that Kiev is attempting to provoke an energy crisis in Hungary ahead of parliamentary elections to create difficulties for the current government and support the political opposition. Hungarian authorities have assured that they will ensure stable oil supplies and the availability of fuel at gas stations. Hungary has oil reserves sufficient to supply refineries for more than three months.
On February 15, Hungary and Slovakia asked Croatia to allow the transit of Russian crude oil through the Adriatic Pipeline. It is expected that it will be delivered to the Croatian port of Omisalj by sea. Budapest believes this can be done in full compliance with EU regulations. The European Commission stated that its oil coordination group was to discuss the issue at its next meeting.

US officials tell DOJ now is the ‘time to act’ on Epstein files investigation in wake of Andrew’s arrest in the UK
‘If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President,’ wrote one Democrat
- Bookmark
After the unprecedented arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor by U.K. authorities, some U.S. lawmakers have demanded greater accountability for individuals linked to Jeffrey Epstein on this side of the Atlantic.
Elected officials from both parties have urged the Trump administration to follow the European nation’s lead and take stronger steps toward securing justice for Epstein’s victims.
“The U.K. is not messing around,” Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat, said. “It’s time to act.”
The former prince was arrested at his residence near Windsor Castle on Thursday. Authorities suspect him of misconduct in public office for allegedly leaking confidential documents to Epstein while serving as the U.K.’s trade envoy. The allegations were uncovered in the latest cache of the so-called Epstein files released by the Department of Justice. The documents appear to include numerous references to King Charles’ brother, whose association with Epstein has long been known. They also contain photos seeming to show the disgraced prince on all fours over a woman.
The 66-year-old Mountbatten-Windsor — the first senior royal in modern history to be arrested — will be held in a cell while he awaits an interview with police.
The arrest comes at a time when public intrigue surrounding the Epstein files — which has endured for years — shows no signs of waning. While campaigning, President Donald Trump vowed to make the government’s records on the convicted sex offender public. Although he resisted the idea after taking office, he later signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, compelling the Department of Justice to release its documents on Epstein. Millions of files have since been published, some of which include references to high-profile individuals and sexual activity with minors. Despite this, the documents have not yet resulted in any prosecutions in the U.S.
‘It’s time to act’
The stunning news of Mountbatten-Windsor’s detention, which came on his 66th birthday, sent shockwaves across the Atlantic, prompting swift reactions from a number of U.S. officials.
Democrats largely led the charge in seeking further action from the Trump administration, which has thus far chosen not to pursue any prosecutions — and President Donald Trump has dismissed the entire Epstein matter as a “hoax.”
“I’m glad to see someone is finally being held accountable,” Maryland Rep. Johnny Olszewski told CNN Thursday morning. “This is far too vast a network for there not to be more accountability.”
He lamented the passivity of the U.S. government, saying: “We can’t even release all the files.”
Attorney General Pam Bondi said in her congressional testimony last week that “all” the files had been made public. However, a recent report by Channel 4 News out of the U.K. claimed that, based on internal emails, only 2 percent of the documents have been released.
New Mexico Rep. Melanie Stansbury also applauded the decisive action by U.K. authorities, writing in a post on X: “If a Prince can be held accountable, so can a President.”
“It’s time to act,” she added.
“If you raped or abused children, you should be prosecuted and held fully accountable,” Arizona Rep. Yassamin Ansari wrote in a social media post about the former prince’s detention.
The DOJ’s files include references to and correspondence from numerous high-profile individuals across all sectors of society, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and film director Woody Allen. Merely being named in the files is not in and of itself evidence of wrongdoing. None of the people named in the file have been charged in U.S. courts.
Some Democrats, meanwhile, accused the Trump administration of deliberately shielding criminals from legal repercussions — while noting that multiple other nations have take action.
“In France, the Paris prosecutor's office just opened two investigations based on new leads from the released files,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “And in Britain, former prince Andrew has been arrested over ties to Epstein. When will there be justice in America?”
Republicans echo calls for accountability
A few Republicans have weighed in following Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, with some of the strongest statements coming from South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace — one of four GOP members who voted to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
“If you’re watching a former prince get arrested today, remember: four Republicans refused to flinch, refused to fold, and forced the Epstein files into the light,” Mace, who is running for South Carolina governor, wrote in a post on X, which she pinned to the top of her feed. “Courage has consequences. So does corruption.”
Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who helped spearhead the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, urged the Trump administration to take a page from the U.K.’s playbook.
“Prince Andrew was just arrested. This was the metric I established for success of the Epstein Files Transparency Act,” he wrote on X. “Now we need JUSTICE in the United States. It’s time for [Bondi] and [FBI Director Kash Patel] to act!”
Trump has not commented publicly on the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor, who was once photographed with him at Mar-a-Lago. In November, the 79-year-old president lamented the disgraced prince being stripped of his royal titles, calling it “a terrible thing.”
A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent.
New developments on Epstein files
While there have not yet been any arrests or prosecutions in the United States, several new developments related to Epstein have emerged in recent days.
On Saturday, the DOJ sent a six-page letter to Congress, which included the names of politicians, businesspeople and celebrities who were mentioned at least once in the files. Among the names listed were Trump, Mountbatten-Windsor and Gates.
This week, billionaire Les Wexner also testified before the House Oversight Committee, claiming he was "duped” by Epstein, his former financial adviser, who he described as a “world-class con man.” Wexner turned over the management of his massive fortune to the convicted sex offender in 1991.
New Mexico lawmakers also approved a comprehensive investigation into Zorro Ranch, a sprawling property once owned by Epstein. The estate is referenced numerous times in the DOJ’s files, which include unconfirmed reports about criminal activity there.
Still, despite limited efforts by lawmakers, the public remains skeptical that justice will be served. According to a new Reuters survey, 69 percent of Americans believe “powerful people in the U.S. are rarely held accountable for their actions.”

Meet Antonia Romeo, Keir Starmer’s super-ambitious pick to reboot the British state

LONDON — “Her office was like something out of Black Mirror,” recalls a young official of her first trip to see the woman now leading Britain’s civil service.
Wherever she looked in Antonia Romeo’s old sanctum at the Department for International Trade, Romeo’s face smiled back. “It was covered in pictures of her with famous people,” the footballer David Beckham among them, the official recalled. “I couldn’t concentrate on the meeting, because I was just looking at the wall thinking, ‘is that Imelda Staunton?’”
If this kind of self-promotion sits awkwardly with Britain’s highly-strung reputation, it clashes violently with the stuffy etiquette of its civil service — where leaders are so notorious for self-restraint and false modesty that they were satirized in a TV drama called “Yes Minister.”

Trump's Board of Peace opens with $10 billion pledge and troops for Gaza
France

US President Donald Trump on Thursday, February 19 promised $10 billion and Muslim-majority nations offered funding and troops for Gaza as he inaugurated his Board of Peace, a new institution whose ultimate mission has drawn questions.
Trump brought together allies from around the world – many authoritarians, with few Western democrats who traditionally ally with the United States – to hail his peacemaking just as he sends US military might near Iran and threatens war.
Presiding with a gavel over the meeting in the gleaming Washington building of the former US Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican, Trump hailed the "powerful people" who joined his board.
"We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We'll make it successful," Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme-song "YMCA" came on the speakers. "We will make it peaceful, and we will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen," Trump said.
Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said the US would contribute $10 billion to the board. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised at least $1 billion. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said more than $6.5 billion was pledged, presumably excluding Trump's offer.
"Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering," said the realtor-turned-president, who has spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.
Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and whether Congress had approved the contribution he announced for the institution, which has drawn criticism for its opaque nature.
Trump will wield veto power over the Board of Peace and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently, rather than enjoy a two-year stint, will need to pay $1 billion.
Troop pledges
The Board of Peace came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating war in Gaza. The plan's second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas, whose unprecedented October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the massive offensive.
In a first for an Arab country, Morocco announced it was ready to send police as well as officers to the nascent International Stabilization Force. The force's American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo were also sending troops and announced that an Indonesian officer would serve as his deputy.
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority country, earlier said it was ready to send 8,000 troops – nearly half of the 20,000 sought. Trump hailed Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who attended, calling the former military officer accused of human rights abuses in East Timor a "tough cookie."
Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian diplomat named high representative for Gaza by the US, also announced the beginning of recruitment for a post-Hamas police force in Gaza and said 2,000 people had applied in the first hours.
Despite the truce, Gaza's health ministry, which operates under Hamas authorities, says Israeli forces have killed at least 601 people since it took effect. Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, representing Israel at the meeting, demanded disarmament of Hamas and "a fundamental deradicalization process" in Gaza.
Mixed attendance
In a rambling speech, Trump denounced domestic opponents, highlighted stock market gains and endorsed the political fortunes of several leaders on stage, including populists Viktor Orban of Hungary and Javier Milei of Argentina. He also issued a new warning to Iran, warning of potential US strikes in 10 days if the clerical state does not agree to major concessions starting with its nuclear program.
Few Western nations joined the board. Britain and Germany sent their ambassadors to Washington as observers, while Canada and France shunned the meeting entirely. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot criticized the European Commission for attending as an observer, saying it did not have a mandate to do so.
Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania, a steadfast US ally, dismissed European concerns that Trump was trying to "replace the UN," to which he drastically cut US support. "But if it helps shake that agonizing giant and, Inshallah, wake it up, then God bless the Board of Peace," Rama said.

‘She always spoke highly of her kid’: Friend of Rhode Island ice rink shooter speaks out on mass shooting

‘She always spoke highly of her kid’: Friend of Rhode Island ice rink shooter speaks out on mass shooting
Robert Dorgan, 56, opened fire at the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a hockey game
- Bookmark
A woman who knew the Rhode Island ice rink shooter as a calm, loving parent says she is still struggling to come to terms with the deadly violence that unfolded during a hockey game earlier this week.
“To see the events of this tragedy was just shocking because she had such a calm demeanor,” a friend of Robert Dorgan, named only as Kimberly by local outlet WCVB, said. Kimberly only knew Dorgan as “Roberta.”
Dorgan, 56, who also went by Roberta Esposito and Roberta Dorgan, walked into the Dennis M. Lynch Arena in Pawtucket during a youth hockey game on Monday and opened fire, killing his ex-wife and their son and wounding three others before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
While investigators have not released a motive, Kimberly told WCVB that nothing in her interactions with Dorgan suggested a capacity for violence.
“I cannot in any situation understand how she can go and take the life of her child, especially because she spoke so highly of them," Kimberly said. "It breaks my heart, I'm disgusted, I'm mad, I'm disappointed.”
Kimberly first came into contact with Dorgan at a biker meetup after they moved to Florida following a divorce and gender-affirming surgery.
“She always put her children on a pedestal,” she told the broadcaster. After spending three years in Florida, Dorgan moved to Maine in 2023 to be closer to family but was frustrated about limited contact with the children, Kimberly added.
“We had a conversation not long after she moved up there, and it was repeated, where she said, you know, ‘I moved all the way up here, and I don’t see my kids as much as I want,’” Kimberly recalled.
“Well, kids, a lot of teenagers don’t want to be around their parents anyway… if I’m being honest, it’s sometimes probably hard when you have the dad, that’s now a mom, and sometimes her wardrobe was sometimes more flamboyant than her personality.”
Authorities say the shooter targeted family members, killing ex-wife Rhonda Dorgan and adult son Aidan Dorgan, and wounding Rhonda’s parents, Linda and Gerald Dorgan, along with a family friend, Thomas Geruso.
Pawtucket Police Chief Tina Goncalves said there was “no indication” of impending violence and noted Dorgan had attended hockey games before without incident.
Court filings show gender identity was initially cited as a factor in the couple’s 2020 divorce, though the final filing listed “irreconcilable differences.” The documents also show the pair shared the same last name even before marriage, a detail authorities have not further explained.
Under the name Roberta Dorgano, Dorgan posted frequently on social media about marital troubles and transgender identity. In 2018, Dorgan wrote that Rhonda “hates the person who stole her husband.” A year later, Dorgan posted: “Transwoman, 6 kids : wife – not thrilled,” and encouraged others not to let being transgender stop them from creating a family.
A day before the shooting, Dorgan responded on X to posts by actor Kevin Sorbo and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, writing that constant criticism of transgender people is “why we Go BERSERK.”
Goncalves credited several “good Samaritans” with intervening during the attack. At least three bystanders tackled Dorgan in the stands as the crowd fled. Dorgan was still able to reach for a second firearm and fatally shoot himself, police said.
A vigil was held Tuesday night at Slatersville Congregational Church in North Smithfield.
“It’s absolutely mind-boggling that this could happen to people we know and love and support through everything,” said Amy Goulet, whose son plays hockey in the community.
Dorgan worked at General Dynamics Bath Iron Works, a Navy shipbuilding facility in Bath, Maine. Co-workers said Dorgan often used the name Roberta at work.
A colleague, Destiny Mackenzie, said Dorgan frequently talked about family and a hockey-playing son. Mackenzie also said Dorgan had a bad temper and sometimes got into screaming matches with co-workers.
The Associated Press reported that, according to military records, Dorgan briefly served in the Marine Corps in 1988 and was separated less than three months later at the lowest rank.

Files reveal Epstein was offered chance to buy US Pentagon, FBI buildings
New files show Epstein, who had close ties to Israel, was offered sensitive US government real estate deals.
Emails released in the United States Department of Justice files show that the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was offered the chance to buy into a sprawling building tied to the Department of Defense in 2016, according to United Kingdom broadcaster ITV News.
The 84,710-square-metre (101,312-suqare-yard) complex, located roughly 1.6km (1 mile) from the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, was described in an investor deck as a “mission-critical” site and “the only property in Arlington, Virginia other than the Pentagon itself with the ability to meet the space and infrastructure needs of the DOD”.

The proposed purchase price was about $116m. The structure of the deal would have made Epstein a co-owner and, effectively, a landlord to the US government.
There is no evidence that the transaction went ahead. But the prospect of a convicted sex offender acquiring a stake in property serving the Pentagon raises serious security questions.
Among millions of emails published last month, an FBI informant wrote in a memo that Epstein was a “Mossad Agent” working for Israel.
“Epstein was close to the former Prime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and trained as a spy under him,” the memo adds.
Epstein maintained a decade-long relationship with Ehud Barak, a former Israeli prime minister and one-time senior military intelligence figure. Barak visited Epstein’s New York townhouse more than 30 times between 2013 and 2017.
The ties between Epstein and Israel have come into sharp focus following the release of the documents. Beyond his interactions with members of the global elite, including Barak, the files document Epstein’s financial support for Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli army and the settler organisation the Jewish National Fund, as well as his connections to the Mossad, Israel’s overseas intelligence agency.
The Pentagon-linked proposal formed part of three documents – an email, an investor presentation and a deal summary – contained within the newly released files.
David Stern, a businessman who referred to himself as Epstein’s “soldier”, forwarded the offer. Stern also served as a close aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested on Thursday on “suspicion of misconduct in public office” following revelations in the Epstein files.
In the same year Stern relayed the Pentagon-area proposal, he became director of the St George’s House Trust at Windsor Castle and attended an event at St James’s Palace, where he sat beside the late Queen Elizabeth II.
Stern also sent Epstein a separate proposal in 2015 to invest in two FBI field offices in Richmond and Baltimore, and courthouses, which were called “sexy assets”. That deal required an initial $25m, followed by a further $80m, with ownership routed through a Cayman Islands offshore entity.
Real estate investor Jonathan D Fascitelli originated both property proposals.

Indonesia pledges 8,000 troops for Gaza force

ALBAWABA- Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Thursday pledged up to 8,000 troops, and potentially more, to support an International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, speaking at the inaugural meeting of the newly formed Board of Peace in Washington.
Addressing leaders gathered at the White House, Prabowo voiced strong confidence in the U.S.-led initiative, expressing optimism that lasting peace in Palestine could be achieved despite expected challenges.
“Even with obstacles and difficulties, we are very optimistic that under the leadership of President Donald Trump, this vision of real peace can be realized,” he said, adding that Indonesia stands ready to play an active role in securing stability in Gaza.
Prabowo said recent ceasefire gains were tangible and reaffirmed Jakarta’s commitment to contribute “a significant number of troops, up to 8,000 or more if necessary”, to help ensure the agreement holds and reconstruction efforts proceed safely.
Separately, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for coordinated international efforts to secure Palestinian self-determination through the establishment of an independent and sovereign state in line with United Nations resolutions.
Sharif stressed that preserving the ceasefire was critical to saving lives and enabling reconstruction, adding that Palestinians must retain full authority over their land and future.
Trump presided over the launch of the Board of Peace, a multilateral body tasked with overseeing Gaza’s reconstruction and promoting broader regional stability. The initiative, endorsed last month in Davos under UN Security Council Resolution 2803, brings together representatives from more than 40 countries to advance a 20-point ceasefire and recovery framework.
The plan focuses on humanitarian assistance, rebuilding infrastructure and deploying the ISF to maintain security during a transitional period before responsibilities shift to restructured Palestinian authorities. Trump announced more than $5 billion in reconstruction pledges and outlined plans aimed at economic revitalization, including major infrastructure and coastal development projects, while reiterating that further progress would depend on Hamas’ disarmament.
The Board of Peace builds on the October 2025 Gaza truce brokered by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt, which ended nearly two years of fighting. While the initiative reflects broad international backing for reconstruction, some allies like France and the UK have voiced concerns over governance arrangements and the extent of U.S. leadership within the framework, particularly amid continued tensions in the West Bank and ongoing disputes surrounding Iran’s nuclear program.

First photos: Former UK royal Andrew seen leaving police station after arrest

Former British royal Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, once known as Prince Andrew, was released Thursday to his home under investigation after being arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
Mountbatten-Windsor, 66, was taken into custody at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk in the morning — coinciding with his birthday — and held by Thames Valley Police for roughly 10 to 11 hours before being released without charge, officials and eyewitnesses said. Searches were carried out at both his Norfolk residence and his former home in Windsor Great Park as part of the probe.
Police said the arrest was made on suspicion of misconduct in public office, a serious offense that can carry heavy penalties, and is linked to an ongoing investigation sparked by newly released documents connected to disgraced financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Some of those files suggest Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential government materials with Epstein during his decade as Britain’s special trade envoy.
Mountbatten-Windsor has previously denied any wrongdoing related to his past association with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in U.S. custody in 2019. His links to Epstein have long shadowed the once-senior royal, leading to his withdrawal from public duties and the stripping of his royal titles and honours in recent years.
The arrest marks a rare moment in modern British history and is believed to be the first time in centuries that a senior royal has been detained on suspicion of a crime.
Hours after the arrest, Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed leaving the Aylsham police station in Norfolk, seated in the back of a vehicle bound for home. It was not immediately clear whether he was released on bail or under investigation.
The police investigation followed public and political pressure after the release of millions of pages from U.S. Justice Department files related to the Epstein case, which have prompted renewed scrutiny of Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct, particularly during official trips as a trade envoy.
King Charles III issued a statement underscoring that “the law must take its course” and pledged full cooperation with authorities, while other senior royals expressed concern over the continuing revelations tied to the scandal.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s legal jeopardy remains unresolved as police continue their inquiry. UK law requires that charges be filed within a set period after an arrest, but authorities have not yet announced whether he will face formal prosecution.

Tunisia jails lawmaker for eight months for mocking president
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
TUNIS, Feb 19 - A Tunisian court on Thursday sentenced lawmaker Ahmed Saidani to eight months in prison over social media posts mocking President Kais Saied, a ruling that opponents say signals an intensifying crackdown on critics.
Once a supporter of Saied’s policies against political opponents, Saidani has become a vocal critic, accusing the president of seeking to monopolise all decision-making while leaving others to bear the blame for problems.
The member of parliament was jailed on charges of insulting others through communication networks, a judicial official said.
Saidani was arrested this month after he mocked the president in a Facebook post, describing him as the "supreme commander of sewage and rainwater drainage".
"This is a violation of the law and an attack on institutions. How can parliament hold the executive authority to account if it carries out an unlawful arrest over critical views", Bilel Mechri, a colleague of Saidani, told Reuters.
Saidani was elected as a lawmaker at the end of 2022 in a parliamentary election with very low voter turnout, following Saied's dissolution of the previous parliament and dismissal of the government in 2021.
Saied has since ruled by decree, moves the opposition has described as a coup.
Most opposition leaders, some journalists and critics of Saied have been imprisoned since he seized control of most powers.
Human rights groups say Saied has cemented his one‑man rule and turned Tunisia into an "open‑air prison" in an effort to suppress his opponents.
Saied says he is enforcing the law and seeking to "cleanse" the country. REUTERS

Danny Dyer claims the BBC ‘hasn’t asked’ him to go on Celebrity Traitors
The ‘Rivals’ star has described rumours of his ‘Celebrity Traitors’ stint as ‘absolute b*****s’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Celebrity Traitors fans who are hoping to see Danny Dyer in the turret this year may be disappointed – the ex EastEnders star has admitted that the BBC is yet to be in touch.
The actor is one of the names rumoured to be taking part in the hit show’s second series, which will air on BBC One later this year. It was previously reported in January that Dyer, 48, was on Celebrity Traitors’ bosses wish lists for the 2026 cast, alongside the likes of Hugh Bonneville, Richard E. Grant and Alison Hammond.
However, the Rivals star hit out at rumours of him joining the show while on The Jonathan Ross Show, calling them “absolute b******s”. When asked whether he would be heading to the Scottish castle, Dyer told Ross in an episode airing on Saturday (21 February): “I don’t why they’re saying it.
“If they ask me I’ll do it, but no one’s asked me. I would f***ing declare it. I’m not on it, you’ll see when it comes on.”
It was reported by The Sun in January that BAFTA-winning actor was being eyed up by Celebrity Traitors producers, having turned down the show last year before becoming a fan. “As soon as his tune changed, it was all systems go,” a source told the publication.
Dyer broke out into acting with his hard man roles in 1999’s Human Traffic and 2004’s The Football Factory, while also working with playwright Harold Pinter by starring in four of his productions. After a nine-year stint in EastEnders as Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter, Dyer won a BAFTA for his performance in comedy Mr. Bigstuff and won rave reviews for his role of Freddie Jones in Rivals.
Teasing the new series of Rivals on The Jonathan Ross Show alongside his Love Island star daughter Dani, Dyer admitted that there are more racy scenes to come for his character.
“I don’t think you’ll be able to watch much of it,” he told Dani, who replied: “There was a scene on the last series. The love-making, I don’t watch. The last one there wasn’t that much.”
“I got away with it last time,” he said. “I don’t get away with it this time.”
The father-daughter duo appear on Saturday’s episode of Ross’ chat show to promote their new Sky One series, in which they open up their own caravan park. Dyer revealed on Tuesday (17 January) that he initially rejected the idea for The Dyers’ Caravan Park, but was inspired by memories of his own “working-class holidays” as a child.
“They were very simple days that I really do miss. So I thought, with the might of Sky behind me, let’s see if we can make caravans interesting again to some people, with my firstborn child, of course.”
The Jonathan Ross Show airs Saturday at 9:25pm on ITV1 and ITVX.

Dani Dyer reveals she’d ‘love’ another chance at Strictly Come Dancing after quitting due to injury
The ‘Love Island’ star was replaced by Amber Davies on the BBC show last year

Dani Dyer has revealed she’d “love” to have another shot at Strictly Come Dancing, after being forced to quit the most recent series due to injury.
The former Love Islander was paired with professional dancer Nikita Kuzmin but the duo never actually got to compete together, as Dyer fractured her ankle before the first live show.
Addressing the fact that her Strictly journey was cut short, Dyer has now said: “I’d love to do it again.”
“If they rang me, I’d answer the phone,” she added, during an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show that airs on Saturday (21 February). “I was devastated. It was hell for me when I hurt my foot, I was so sad.”
Dyer is appearing on the ITV talk show alongside her dad, Danny, to promote their new programme, The Dyers' Caravan Park, which sees the pair try to restore a caravan park to its former glory.
There is a precedent for injured Strictly stars getting a second chance. Jamie Laing was also forced to pull out of the competition before delivering a full performance back in 2019, after suffering an injury while filming the launch show. He gave it another go in 2020 – and made it to the final.
Announcing her Strictly exit last September, Dyer told fans: “The doctors have said I am not allowed to dance so l’ve had to pull out of the show. To say I’m heartbroken is the biggest understatement.”
She was replaced by fellow Love Island alumna Amber Davies, who had less than 48 hours to prepare before the first live show.
Davies wasted no time in impressing the judges and cementing herself as a serious contender – but the 29-year-old struggled to win over some viewers, with many claiming her West End career gave her an unfair advantage.
The criticism intensified in the run-up to the final and Davies’ professional partner said she was receiving “hate every single day”.
Making an impassioned speech during the live semi-final, Kuzmin said Davies nevertheless “came every single day into the training room with a big smile, ignoring everybody”.
“You were always so kind, you’re so caring,” he added, becoming tearful. “You care more about me when I’m supposed to care about you. You care about me every single day. You are such a lovely, positive person.”
Addressing Strictly fans at home, Kuzmin pleaded: “Please, please be kind because it costs nothing and you don’t deserve none of that.”
The pair were the highest-scoring couple in the following Saturday’s live final, receiving a near-perfect 118 out of a possible 120 after performing their three dances – but Davies missed out on the Glitterball, which was won by ex-England player Karen Carney.
The Jonathan Ross Show airs on Saturday at 9.25pm on ITV1 and ITVX.

Grey’s Anatomy star Patrick Dempsey opens up why he left hit medical drama
The 60-year-old played Dr Derek Shepherd, known to fans as McDreamy, in the show

Actor Patrick Dempsey has revealed why he left his role in medical drama Grey’s Anatomy.
Dempsey, now aged 60, left the show in 2015 and has now opened up on why it was “time to walk away”.
He played Dr Derek Shepherd, affectionately dubbed "McDreamy" by fans.
Dempsey was a beloved original cast member from Grey’s Anatomy’s 2005 inception before leaving during the show’s 11th series.
The show was US medical drama chronicling the lives of surgical interns and their supervisors at Seattle’s Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.
Speaking about his shock exit, the star told ITV’s The Jonathan Ross Show: “It was time to walk away.
“I had the opportunity to do a full season in the WEC, which is the (FIA) World Endurance Championship. That was my love.”
Dempsey left the show after almost a decade and went on to participate in the WEC, an international sportscar racing competition, achieving first place in a six-hour-long endurance race held in Japan.
He added: “For me, it’s (Grey’s Anatomy) been a blessing. It’s given me a wonderful platform.
“I think the best thing that has come out of it is that a lot of young people have gone into the medical profession because of it – I think that’s a great thing.”
Dempsey said that despite the popularity of Emmy-winning show, he has tried to keep it away from his children, who he described as “very direct” with their opinions.
He said: “I didn’t really expose them to the show (Grey’s Anatomy). I kept them as far away as possible.”
He went on to say that the popularity of the hit medical drama helped him with his charity work, which has seen him open a cancer treatment centre in his hometown in Lewiston, Maine.
According to its website, The Dempsey Centre provides free holistic treatment to cancer patients including nutritional care, counselling, fitness classes and integrative therapies.
Dempsey said: “It was inspired by my own mother’s cancer journey – she had ovarian cancer over 12 recurrences. We don’t treat the disease, we treat the person holistically and the visibility of the show (Grey’s Anatomy) helped me do that.”
He added: “You come out of surgery and your treatment, you may be cured but you’re not healed and that’s where we come in.”
Dempsey also spoke about being named the “sexiest man alive” by People magazine in 2023, and called it “quite a shock” at his age.
The actor is known for playing heartthrobs on-screen, and has starred in a string of romantic comedies as the love interest such as Enchanted (2007), Made Of Honor (2008) and more recently, Bridget Jones’ Baby (2016).
Dempsey currently stars in new US crime drama Memory Of A Killer, where he leads a double life as a family man and a hit-man.

Israeli companies grew more when listed in Tel Aviv than on NASDAQ, study reveals

Israeli companies listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) outperform their NASDAQ listings, with the “local version” of these shares seeing higher growth in trading volume and total market value than their “US version,” according to a Wednesday report by TASE.
The report points out that one of the main reasons behind this performance difference is centered around the “home factor,” with investors opting to invest in the company's local markets rather than overseas, even if it means choosing the TASE over NASDAQ, Yuval Tsuk, an economist working at TASE’s research unit, explained.
This is evident in the numbers: TASE stocks saw a 68% increase in trading volume, while the same shares on the NASDAQ averaged a 55% increase, according to TASE data.
This can also apply to local investors, who prefer investing in the local market over a foreign one, mainly because of conversion costs and more convenient trading hours.
In 2025, dual-listed companies accounted for 22% of the TASE's total market cap, totaling $114 billion. Among the highest-valued were Teva, Elbit Systems, and Tower, which had a combined market cap of $76 billion.
This margin became even higher in February, when Palo Alto Networks ($115 billion) announced it would list on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) as part of its acquisition of the Israeli cybersecurity platform CyberArk.
The report also noted that ten dual-listed companies achieved share yields exceeding the TA-125 index's 51% yield, indicating they outperformed the Israeli market as a whole.
The leading companies from this list were Lineage Cell Therapeutics with an annual yield of 175.8%, Enlight Energy with an annual yield of 129.6%, and Kenon Holding with an annual yield of 101.2%.
TASE’s new trading week brings Wall Street capital to Israel
A factor that didn’t affect the 2025 metrics but could apply to the first month of 2026 is the trading-day shift the TASE implemented since January.
The market shifted from a Sunday-to-Thursday schedule, aligned with the traditional Israeli workweek, to a Monday-to-Friday schedule, which aligns with most international markets.
With this, TASE managed to attract international investors, especially on Fridays, with that day seeing a doubling of foreign investor involvement compared with Sunday’s metrics in 2025.
”Furthermore, higher trading activity was recorded on Fridays across the entire Israeli equity market relative to the average Sunday trading volumes in 2025,” Tsuk explained in the analysis.

As the US eyes Iran showdown, how far should it go?

As the final pieces of the US military buildup all fall into place in the Middle East, it appears increasingly clear that, from a purely military standpoint, Iran is not a rival capable of genuinely challenging the US. That said, Tehran should not be underestimated. As demonstrated in limited confrontations in the past, particularly in the missile front, Iran possesses significant asymmetric capabilities: a substantial ballistic arsenal and a broad network of regional proxies.
Yet even before addressing the tactical questions of how an attack would be carried out, it is essential to define its objectives realistically. What strategic shift could military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran achieve? To answer that, it is necessary to examine the main courses of action reportedly under consideration by President Donald Trump and his administration.
A campaign to change the regime
According to reports, the US military has prepared for "weeks" of sustained operations against Iran, suggesting that the administration may be seriously weighing a move aimed at deep political change. Such a goal is inherently difficult to achieve, certainly by military force alone. Senior US officials have publicly distanced themselves from it. Vice President JD Vance, for example, has said that such a mission is "up to the Iranian people" if they choose to pursue it.
There are significant obstacles. Iran does not have a unified and capable opposition ready to step in and fill a vacuum. At the very least, none has emerged publicly, and any early signs may have been suppressed in recent protests, including political arrests targeting reformist figures within the regime's own support base. Moreover, achieving regime change would almost certainly require ground forces and a prolonged effort, a scenario with little appetite among the American public and political establishment, still mindful of the bloody decades in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Destabilizing the regime from within
The current tensions began amid a wave of protests against the Iranian regime. One possible rationale for military action, therefore, would be to intensify internal pressure in a way that weakens the leadership and brings its opponents closer to a tipping point.
This option also faces serious challenges. The Iranian leadership, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, has no escape plan comparable to the one that stood before former Syrian President Bashar Assad or other dictators. That means it is likely to respond to any internal unrest with maximum force, as seen recently in the killing of thousands of protesters in January.
Even if such pressure were to succeed, the most probable outcome would not necessarily be a transition to democracy but rather internal chaos that could push Iran toward civil war, with severe regional and global repercussions. If Washington were to pursue this path, it would need a coherent plan to move quickly from chaos to stability in order to safeguard its own interests and those of its allies in the region.
Striking nuclear facilities
Administration officials have repeatedly stressed that the overriding objective is to prevent the ayatollah regime from obtaining nuclear weapons. One possibility, therefore, is that any attack, similar to the one carried out in June, would focus on nuclear infrastructure and sites, to the extent that they remain intact or have been restored since the 12-day war.
Here, too, a fundamental problem emerges. Airstrikes cannot erase scientific knowledge or human capital, and no one can guarantee that all stockpiles of enriched uranium accumulated by Iran over the years can be located and destroyed. As seen after the June war and in satellite imagery circulating since, if Tehran survives such an assault, it may move to rebuild the project with greater determination and fewer self-imposed restraints born of its reluctance to trigger open military confrontation.
Destroying Iran's missile project
Iran's missile force is the central pillar of its retaliatory and defensive capabilities. The Islamic Republic has invested its best resources on this front, viewing it as the backbone of deterrence against conventionally superior militaries. A broad campaign could severely damage missile stockpiles and production infrastructure, removing, at least temporarily, this significant threat.
But even after heavy losses, Tehran would likely prioritize the rapid restoration of these capabilities. The result could be only a temporary setback rather than permanent elimination. The difficulty of dismantling a ballistic project has also been demonstrated in Israeli and US operations against the Houthis, whose capabilities are deeply rooted in Iranian support.
Forcing negotiations on favorable terms
Trump's preferred option may not be war but a deal. The president has expressed this repeatedly, and the direct talks held in recent weeks between Washington and Tehran suggest that this channel remains open. The logic is that sufficient military pressure would compel Tehran to accept more favorable terms than those it previously rejected.
Past confrontations indicate that Iran's leadership may choose to absorb a blow rather than capitulate, which it views as an existential danger in light of internal pressure. The regime could calculate that time is on its side and that as a conflict drags on, political pressure on Washington to wind it down will intensify, as occurred in the campaign against the Iran-backed Houthis that Trump launched and ended within months without tangible gains.
Eliminating Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
Ali Khamenei is indeed the central figure in Iran's ruling system. To some extent, his steadfast refusal to accept certain conditions in negotiations with the US can be seen as a key catalyst behind the erosion of stability within the ayatollah regime.
Yet so-called decapitation strikes often produce unpredictable results. Iran's political system is institutional, not solely personal. There is no guarantee that removing Khamenei would moderate Iranian policy; it could just as easily radicalize it. Such a move could trigger a fierce response from Iran and its regional proxies, given the senior ayatollah's religious stature, and draw the US into a far broader confrontation than originally intended.
America's military superiority in a direct clash is not in doubt. But military superiority does not automatically translate into strategic advantage, and that is precisely the dilemma. For the first time in decades, the US faces the prospect of direct war with a state actor rather than a proxy conflict. That demands leaders who define in advance what they are seeking to achieve.
Of all the options outlined above, none is simple, and each carries consequences that Washington may not be fully prepared to manage. Before embarking on any course of action, decision-makers must answer one fundamental question: What does success look like, and at what price?

Israeli settler kills Palestinian-American teen in West Bank, local health ministry says

A 19-year-old Palestinian-American citizen shot by an Israeli settler in the West Bank has died from his wounds, the Palestinian Health Ministry said late on Wednesday.
A US embassy official condemned the violence, telling Reuters on Thursday: "The US Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas."
Nasrallah Mohammed Jamal Abu Siam was shot on Wednesday in the village of Mukhmas near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
A relative of Abu Siam, who did not wish to give his name out of fear of reprisals from Israeli security forces, said that settlers had raided the village to steal sheep.
The relative said that when villagers, including Abu Siam, had tried to prevent the theft, the settlers had begun firing at them, wounding Abu Siam and others.
The attacks injured five people, three of whom suffered bullet wounds, including Abu Siam, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA said. The agency did not give details on the other injuries.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident.
Settler violence in the West Bank
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the war in Gaza in October 2023, with nearly 700 people displaced due to settler attacks in 2026, according to UN data.
Nine Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in 2026, according to UN data, while 240 were killed in 2025. Two Israelis were killed in the West Bank during 2025, according to the data.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.
Several US citizens, including the activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers over the past two years in the West Bank.

Dwayne Johnson’s energy drink company could owe you money after $3 million settlement
Customers have until February 20 to file a claim
- Bookmark

Thanks to a class action settlement, customers will technically be able to say “The Rock owes me money.”
ZOA Energy, the energy drink brand co-owned by Dwayne Johnson, agreed to a $3 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit that accused the company of deceptive marketing.
Now, American customers may be eligible for cash payouts of up to $150 if they bought a ZOA Energy drink labeled “0 preservatives” for personal use between March 1, 2021, and November 21, 2025, according to the settlement.
The lawsuit against ZOA Energy — which was initially filed in the Northern District of California in October 2023 — claimed that the drinks contained chemical preservatives, specifically citric and ascorbic acids, despite advertising that the products are preservative-free.
Johnson’s brand refused to admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to settle, according to the federal complaint which states: “ZOA denies these allegations and maintains that its labeling and marketing are truthful, accurate, and compliant with applicable law.”
Cash payments are available to customers depending on the number of energy drinks they bought within the window, and whether they have proof of purchase.
People who submit approved claims with receipts can get a payment of up to $150 per household, but those without receipts will be capped at a $10 payment per household.
However, customers must submit a valid claim form by February 20, either electronically or by mail, to receive the free money. Customers must redeem the payments within 180 days or risk losing them.
The final approval hearing for the class action settlement is set for March 26.
“The proposed relief offered to Class Members will be provided only if the Court gives final approval to the Settlement and, if there are any appeals, after the appeals are resolved in favor of the Settlement,” the complaint said.
Johnson launched ZOA Energy in 2021 with his ex-wife Dany Garcia, celebrity personal trainer Dave Rienzi and investor John Shulman. The energy drink is marketed as a “better-for-you” pick-me-up, emphasizing clean energy from plant-based caffeine, electrolytes and zero sugar.
Alcohol giant Molson Coors bought a majority ownership stake of the energy drink brand in 2024, but ZOA Energy still uses Johnson to promote its products in advertisements and on social media platforms.
In another massive payout, Amazon customers can get a refund up to $51 by filing a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission by July 23, 2026.

UK police says ex-Prince Andrew released under investigation
Published February 19, 2026last updated February 19, 2026What you need to know
- After his arrest, UK police says ex-Prince Andrew was "released under investigation"
- UK media including the BBC widely report that it is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew, the brother of King Charles
- Andrew had been known as an associate of Jeffrey Epstein for years, but featured more in the latest release of information
- Officers were seen at his residence shortly before the police comments on Thursday
- King Charles said the royals would cooperate with authorities, but that it would not be appropriate for him to comment further
Likely scenario would be seeing Andrew 'in a criminal court,' royal biographer tells DW
Royal biographer Christopher Wilson spoke to DW about the arrest of ex-Prince Andrew and surmised that authorities would have gathered "a huge body of evidence" beforehand.
"The police, and particularly politicians behind them, would not allow an intrusion of this kind and an arrest to take place unless they're pretty certain that they've got a watertight case against Andrew," Wilson said.
The historian said a likely scenario would be seeing Andrew "in a criminal court."
"I don't think he'll escape. I think he will stay and face the music," Wilson said.
"It will be a sensation. No member of the royal family has been arrested for 600 years, and the last person to do that was King Charles the First, who had his head chopped off once they had actually finished with him in court," Wilson explained.
"I can't see that happening to former Prince Andrew but he certainly faces a bleak future in this year coming," Wilson said.
Trump says former prince's arrest 'very sad'
US President Donald Trump has commented after the arrest of former Prince Andrew's arrest in connection with Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
"I think it's a shame. I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It's very, very sad," Trump told reporters on Air Force One.
Trump also praised King Charles, saying he "would be coming to our country very soon."
The US president made the comments as he travelled to Georgia for an event.
Andrew leaves police station
The former UK prince, Andrew, has left a police station around 11 hours after being arrested earlier in the day.
Police said he had "been released under investigation."
"We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded," Thames Valley Police said, in reference to the royal Sandringham estate.

Recap — in case you're just joining us
It's been a busy day in the UK with the arrest of King Charles III's younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, amid an investigation into possible misconduct in public office.
The former Duke of York, who turned 66 on Thursday, was taken into custody by police in unmarked cars at his Norfolk residence before noon.
King Charles III later said that "the law must take its course," and repeated a pledge from Buckingham Palace to cooperate with Thames Valley Police if requested.
Andrew had long been plagued by scandal surrounding his association with deceased US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the latest release of files had renewed scrutiny of the man stripped of his royal titles late last year.
Police have not commented in detail on the ongoing investigation but it is thought to be connected to the emails published en masse by the US Deparment of Justice on January 30. Several of these were from or to an addressee labeled either "A" or "the Duke."
Since that publication, an anti-monarchy group in the UK known as Republic said it had filed a formal complaint pertaining to emails which seemed to show Andrew had forwarded information on foreign trips he had made as a UK trade envoy in 2010.
British politicians have not exactly rushed to comment, perhaps in part after police issued an appeal to consider contempt of court risks, but Prime Minister Keir Starmer had said shortly before the news broke that "nobody is above the law."
UK PM Starmer: 'Nobody is above the law'
A few hours before the news of the police investigation broke on Thursday, Prime Minsiter Keir Starmer was asked about Mountbatten-Windsor on the BBC Breakfast television show.
"One of the core principles in our system is that everybody is equal under the law, and nobody is above the law," Starmer, formerly a director of public prosecutions, said. "And it is important that that is applied across the board."

Senior royal arrest unprecedented in modern UK history, but many past parallels exist
An arrest of a senior royal family member has not taken place in the UK for well over a century, making Thursday's developments more or less unique in a modern British law enforcement context.
Nevertheless, the arrest, detention or legal punishment of senior relatives of the kings and queens of England is by no means unprecedented if you look further back into history.
Indeed, these cases tended to involve much higher and more violent stakes than Thursday's. A very abridged selection follows:
- In 1330, King Edward III successfully launched a coup at the age of 17 to seize power from his mother's husband, Roger Mortimer, who had been the de facto ruler since Edward was formally crowned three years earlier. He imprisoned Mortimer and his mother Isabella of France.
- During the 15th century civil war known as the Wars of the Roses, the last Plantaganet king, Richard III is thought to have put his nephews in the Tower of London, from which they never emerged, albeit without ever formally arresting them.
- After the Tudors came to power and deposed Richard, their second king, Henry VIII, would famously imprison and ultimately execute two of his six wives — Anne Boleyn and Katherine Howard.
- Henry's penchant for divorce led to more than a century of intermittent royal and civil conflict surrounding Britain's switch from Catholicism to a form of Protestantism:
- This included the imprisonment of the woman who would become Queen Elizabeth I under her sister Mary I; Elizabeth I jailing and then executing her cousin Mary Queen of Scots; Charles I being publicly beheaded, leading to the only period without an English king or queen in around a millennium; and England's last Catholic king, James II, being deposed in 1688.
Accuser Giuffre's relatives say Andrew 'was never a prince'
The family of deceased Epstein and Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre issued a statement to CBS News in the US in light of Thursday's developments.
"At last, today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty," Giuffre's siblings said in a statement.
"He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you," they wrote.
Giuffre died by suicide last April. Her book was published posthumously later that year, alleging three sexual enconters with Andrew.
Andrew reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in March 2022.
Based on the very limited preliminary information, Andrew's reported arrest on Thursday appears related to suspicion of "misconduct in public office" rather sexual misconduct allegations, which he has denied.

Popular young prince who later fell from grace, partly at hands of Emily Maitlis
Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Andrew, the spare rather than the heir to use the phrase popularized by the Netflix series "The Crown," was rather a popular royal in his younger life.
Gregarious and outgoing, in contrast to his elder brother Charles who faced far greater public pressure and scrutiny, he served for 22 years with the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot in the Falklands War in 1982.
Fellow "spare" Prince Harry would follow a similar path in Afghanistan a generation later.
Andrew's marriage to Sarah Ferguson, formerly the Duchess of York, became a subject of considerable press attention, as did their 1992 separation and 1996 divorce, not long after Charles' contentious divorce from Princess Diana.
But Andrew's lifestyle and associations with questionable characters including but not limited to Jeffrey Epstein, American financier and convicted sex offender, put him under increasing pressure as time went on.
In 2011, his ties to Epstein, convicted on sex offenses three years earlier, led to his resignation from a role as a trade envoy for the UK.
In 2019, amid even more intense public scrutiny, the prince gave a disastrous interview to the then-BBC journalist Emily Maitlis for the "Newsnight" program. Designed to explain away his connections to Epstein and allegations of sexual misconduct from the late Virginia Giuffre, it backfired.
The claims that prompted scrutiny and skepticism included Andrew saying that he could not possibly have been guilty of an alleged case of misconduct in 2001 because he was at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking with his children at the time, and him saying that as a result of his military service in the Falklands, he was no longer able to sweat.
He announced he would step back from public engagements as a royal soon after.
Buckingham Palace said last week it would cooperate with police if asked
On Monday, February 9, Buckingham Palace made the unprecedented announcement that it was ready to cooperate in the event of a police inquiry into Mountbatten-Windsor's alleged links to Epstein.
"While the specific claims in question are for Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor to address, if we are approached by Thames Valley Police, we stand ready to support them as you would expect," a statement from the palace said.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on February 1 that he also thought Andrew should testify in the US. This was a change in stance from earlier comments, where Starmer had only said it was a matter for the former prince.
Congress has been trying to secure testimony from Mountbatten-Windsor for some time. In November, six Democratic members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released a letter addressed to Andrew requesting that he appear.
"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation," they wrote.
King Charles: 'The law must take its course'
King Charles III has issued a statement in light of the reports of his younger brother's arrest.
"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office," Charles said.
"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities."
Charles said that authorities would "have our full and wholehearted support and cooperation" in their investigations, repeating a message first published earlier in the month by Buckingham Palace.
"Let me state clealy: the law must take its course," he said. "As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all."
Andrew stripped of titles, but technically still eighth in line to throne
Charles III's decision, with support of parliament, to strip his younger brother of his prince title and dukedom late last year means he is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mountbatten is the original surname of his late father Prince Philip, and the House of Windsor is the UK's current royal house.
Nevertheless, Andrew does remain the line of succession to the British throne, as does Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, who retains his titles but stepped down from his position as a senior royal in 2020.
However, the chances of Andrew, once second in line after his elder brother, becoming king are now extremely small. He is eighth in line, after Harry's youngest child Lilibet.
Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing connected to Epstein
The former prince, the late Queen Elizabeth II's second son, has faced various allegations tied to Jeffrey Epstein for several years now.
He had always denied any wrongdoing in this context and said that he regrets their friendship, after several stays on Epstein's island.
Last November, the British royal family said it had begun the "formal" process of stripping the 66-year-old, whose birthday falls on February 19, of his titles and residence.
Among other things, this came amid the launch of a posthumous memoir written by Virginia Giuffre, who described three alleged sexual encounters with the then-prince in her book. She took her own life last April.
The more recent release of Epstein communications included many emails from a man who went by the email ID of either "A" or "The Duke."
The anti-monarchy group Republic reported the former Duke of York to police regarding files they said suggested that he had forwarded reports about official visits to Vietnam, Singapore and other places in 2010.
In the UK, misconduct in public office is what's known as a "common law offense," that is a crime that's been established by a combination of legal precedent and custom, not by a formal act of parliament. Police had previously said that this makes the current investigation particularly complex.
What did Thames Valley Police say about the arrest?
Thames Valley Police issued a press statement soon after reports in the Daily Telegraph, on the BBC and elsewhere of police outside Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's residence in Norfolk.
"As part of the investigation, we have today [February 19] arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk," police wrote.
The man remained in custody, they said.
"We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court."
Police also quoted Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright in the written statement.
"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office," Wright said. "It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offense."
Police said they appreciated the "considerable public interest" in the case and promised further information in due course.
Developing — Man, reportedly former Prince Andrew, arrested in UK
British police said on Thursday that a man in his sixties had been arrested on suspsicion of misconduct in public office, but that they would not be naming him "as per national guidance."
The BBC and several British newspapers reported that the police had arrested King Charles' younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, aged 66, in connection with his alleged links to deceased US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew's ties to Epstein had been known and the subject of controversy for years, but the former prince features again and more frequently in the latest release of documents by US authorities, prompting renewed interest.
He was formally stripped of his remaining royal titles by King Charles last October.
Further updates on this developing story will follow here.

"Let me state clealy: the law must take its course," he said. "As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all."
Andrew stripped of titles, but technically still eighth in line to throne
Charles III's decision, with support of parliament, to strip his younger brother of his prince title and dukedom late last year means he is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mountbatten is the original surname of his late father Prince Philip, and the House of Windsor is the UK's current royal house.
Nevertheless, Andrew does remain the line of succession to the British throne, as does Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, who retains his titles but stepped down from his position as a senior royal in 2020.
However, the chances of Andrew, once second in line after his elder brother, becoming king are now extremely small. He is eighth in line, after Harry's youngest child Lilibet.
Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing connected to Epstein
The former prince, the late Queen Elizabeth II's second son, has faced various allegations tied to Jeffrey Epstein for several years now.
He had always denied any wrongdoing in this context and said that he regrets their friendship, after several stays on Epstein's island.
Last November, the British royal family said it had begun the "formal" process of stripping the 66-year-old, whose birthday falls on February 19, of his titles and residence.
Among other things, this came amid the launch of a posthumous memoir written by Virginia Giuffre, who described three alleged sexual encounters with the then-prince in her book. She took her own life last April.
The more recent release of Epstein communications included many emails from a man who went by the email ID of either "A" or "The Duke."
The anti-monarchy group Republic reported the former Duke of York to police regarding files they said suggested that he had forwarded reports about official visits to Vietnam, Singapore and other places in 2010.
In the UK, misconduct in public office is what's known as a "common law offense," that is a crime that's been established by a combination of legal precedent and custom, not by a formal act of parliament. Police had previously said that this makes the current investigation particularly complex.
What did Thames Valley Police say about the arrest?
Thames Valley Police issued a press statement soon after reports in the Daily Telegraph, on the BBC and elsewhere of police outside Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's residence in Norfolk.
"As part of the investigation, we have today [February 19] arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk," police wrote.
The man remained in custody, they said.
"We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court."
Police also quoted Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright in the written statement.
"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office," Wright said. "It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offense."
Police said they appreciated the "considerable public interest" in the case and promised further information in due course.
Developing — Man, reportedly former Prince Andrew, arrested in UK
British police said on Thursday that a man in his sixties had been arrested on suspsicion of misconduct in public office, but that they would not be naming him "as per national guidance."
The BBC and several British newspapers reported that the police had arrested King Charles' younger brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, aged 66, in connection with his alleged links to deceased US financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Andrew's ties to Epstein had been known and the subject of controversy for years, but the former prince features again and more frequently in the latest release of documents by US authorities, prompting renewed interest.
He was formally stripped of his remaining royal titles by King Charles last October.
Further updates on this developing story will follow here.

Winter Olympics recap: US beats Canada in OT for women’s hockey gold medal, Stolz stunned in 1,500
Winter Olympics recap: US beats Canada in OT for women’s hockey gold medal, Stolz stunned in 1,500
MILAN (AP) — The U.S. women’s hockey team delivered an Olympic comeback for the ages by beating Canada 2-1 in overtime to win the gold medal at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Thursday.
With her team trailing 1-0, American captain Hilary Knight forced overtime by tipping in Laila Edwards’ shot with 2:04 remaining in regulation.
Megan Keller then scored 4:07 into overtime to hand the U.S. its third Olympic gold medal in women’s hockey.
It was the seventh time the two powerhouses faced off for Olympic gold since women’s hockey debuted at the 1998 Nagano Games. In the 2022 Beijing final, Canada beat the Americans in the final.
With the sides playing 3-on-3 in overtime, Keller broke up the left wing and pushed past Claire Thompson. Driving to the net, Keller got off a backhander that beat Ann-Renee Desbiens.
Kristin O’Neill scored a short-handed goal for Canada in the second period.
Earlier Thursday, Alina Muller scored the bronze medal-winning goal in overtime in Switzerland’s 2-1 victory over Sweden. It came 12 years after Muller scored the clinching goal to deliver the Swiss their first Olympic medal in women’s hockey — a bronze at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Jordan Stolz stunned in 1,500 meters
U.S. speedskater Jordan Stolz’s late push wasn’t enough.
The American star settled for silver in the 1,500 meters, missing a chance to secure a third gold medal at the Milan Cortina Games.
China’s Ning Zhongyan won Thursday’s race in an Olympic-record time of 1 minute, 41.98 seconds. The 21-year-old Stolz, who won gold medals in the 500 and 1,000 at these Games, crossed 0.77 seconds later.
As Stolz glided by, hands on his knees, Ning raised his country’s flag aloft with both hands and started a victory lap.
Stolz, a Wisconsin native, will participate in the mass start on Saturday.
Dutch skater Kjeld Nuis, who won the 1,500 at the past two Olympics, took bronze.
Eileen Gu advances to halfpipe final despite fall
Defending Olympic champion Eileen Gu shook off a fall during her opening run to advance to Saturday’s final in freeski halfpipe. The 22-year-old Gu was born in the United States and competes for China.
She clipped the lip of the halfpipe on the third trick of her first run, knocking her left ski off and sending her skittering to the bottom of the course.
That set up a pressure-packed second attempt that run earned 86.50 points, good enough to place fifth among the 12 skiers who advanced to the final.
US and Canada reach women’s curling semifinals
The United States and Canada advanced to the women’s curling semifinals.
The Americans, skipped by Tabitha Peterson, beat Switzerland 7-6 in a match that went to an extra end. The teams will square off again in Friday’s semifinals.
Peterson threw the decisive rock and her teammates swept it into position, just a hair closer to the button than the Swiss’ nearest stone.
Canada beat South Korea 10-7 and will play Sweden on Friday.

Kosovo's Catholics and Muslims mark Ash Wednesday and Ramadan in one week
Kosovo’s religious diversity came to light this week as the Balkan nation’s Christian and Muslim communities both embarked on a traditional period of fasting and spiritual reflection
- Bookmark
Kosovo 's religious diversity came to light this week as the Balkan nation's Christian and Muslim communities both embarked on a traditional period of fasting and spiritual reflection.
This year marks a rare occasion when the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Catholics' Ash Wednesday coincided, encouraging tolerance and understanding between different religions.
Kosovo, a young nation of 2 million people, is more than 90% Muslim and is still reeling from a war in 1998-99 it waged for independence from predominantly Orthodox Christian Serbia. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian authorities have pledged to promote religious and ethnic tolerance following the conflict that killed 13,000 people.
On Wednesday evening, Catholics in Kosovo's capital Pristina gathered at the city's Mother Teresa Cathedral where worshippers had their forehead marked with ashes in a symbol of repentance for sins and humility.
To Catholics, the day marks the start of the 40-day Lent period of penance, solemn reflection and fasting before Easter. The Islamic holy month of Ramadan, similarly marking a period of increased worship before the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, started in Kosovo on Thursday.
“It is a special opportunity that this year we have Lent and Ramadan together," said Dode Palukaj, a Catholic. “What unites us is fasting, shared prayer, solidarity and love.”
Ash Wednesday and the start of Ramadan coincide approximately every 30 years or so. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar; the start of the month traditionally depends on the sighting of the crescent moon and may vary among countries.
Don Agim Qerkini, the Catholic priest in Pristina, praised religious tolerance in Kosovo over centuries, noting that divisions that still plague Kosovo have been stemming from national rather than religious differences.
“Faith is what enriched us for many centuries,“ he said. "It is a reality we are proud of, precisely because our history, as we all know, has faced many different hardships,"
Serbia still refuses to recognize Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence and the dispute between the two has been a source of continuous tension in the volatile Balkans.
Varis Hashimi, a Muslim from the southern historically multi-ethnic town of Prizren, has made it his mission to keep alive a tradition dating back to the centuries of Ottoman rule in Kosovo.
For the entire month of Ramadan, Hashimi walks every day to a medieval fortress above Prizren to light fireworks and thus signal the end of the daily fast. In the Ramadan tradition, families then get together for the evening meal.
Locals say this was done with a cannon in the past. Nowadays, Hashimi rushed uphill at sunset on Thursday to light his first fireworks this year into the sky.
“The idea is to revive an old tradition," he said.
Down the hill, Prizren's mosques echoed with Iftar, sounding the end of the daily fast as the town's restaurants opened their doors for hungry visitors.

Government maintains stance it is not aiding IS brides: Watt
By Brittany Busch
The government is maintaining its stance of not aiding the 11 women and 23 children of the IS bride cohort seeking repatriation to Australia, despite revelations that the group had been issued Australian passports.
Environment Minister Murray Watt would not concede that the government had a responsibility to protect the Australian children interned in a Syrian camp, saying the situation was the fault of their parents.
“I do have sympathy for those children, and our government has sympathy for those children, but the decision to put the children in these situations was made by their parents. That’s something that we can’t change,” Watt told ABC Radio National.
“Keeping Australians safe is our overriding priority.”

Duniam claims he does not know who wrote leaked immigration policy
By Brittany Busch
Sticking with the opposition home affairs spokesman, Duniam said he did not know who wrote the leaked immigration policy Coalition MPs have distanced themselves from, but said it was the work of an “individual in another office”.
“I don’t know for sure who wrote it, but indeed, as you would expect, there are members of our staff in various offices, including the former leader’s office, who don’t just wait to be told to do things. They will often draft up possible ideas,” Duniam told ABC Radio National.
“I can tell you, though, of course, working with Sussan Ley, with Paul Scarr, with Michaelia, Cash, Julian Leeser and others, Andrew Bragg included, we had an excellent package ready to release just prior to those terrible events at Bondi at the end of last year that, of course, was delayed in response to dealing with those matters.”
He said the policy was delayed after the Bondi attack and was being revised when Ley was ousted, and that the leaked policy “were internal works by an individual in another office, and something I’d not had a chance to properly interrogate”.
“I’m now getting on with the job… drafting our policy so that we can present to Australians something that will actually deliver an immigration system that gives us as a country what we need.”

Children in IS bride cohort could be ‘radicalised’ already: Duniam
By Brittany Busch
Opposition home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam has claimed it was possible children in the Islamic State cohort trying to return to Australia had already been radicalised and should therefore be treated as a potential risk.
Speaking to ABC Radio National, Duniam was played a clip from then prime minister Scott Morrison who repatriated Australian children from Syria in 2019.
“They’ve got off to a horrible start in life as a result of the appalling decisions of their parents, and they’ll find their home in Australia and I’m sure they’ll be embraced by Australians, and as a result of that embrace, I’m sure they will live positive and happy lives,” Morrison said at the time.
Duniam said that situation was different because the children were orphans, whereas the 23 children trapped in Syria now are subject to the decisions of their parents.
“Anyone being repatriated from this part of the world is somehow… a risk when it comes to our security,” he said.
“There was overnight, of course, footage emerging of, very sadly, children acting in a way you could only describe as radicalised towards journalists from the United States who were visiting one of these displacement camps, and so we cannot ignore the risk associated with individuals, whether they be minors or indeed adults, when it comes to repatriating them here … Some reports suggest that these aren’t just infants, they are indeed inclusive of teenagers who would be more advanced in thinking and beliefs than perhaps a younger child.”

Need to distinguish between immigration debate and divisive rhetoric: McIntosh
By Emily Kaine
Opposition communications spokeswoman Melissa McIntosh has joined a chorus of MPs condemning Pauline Hanson’s anti-Muslim remarks.
Speaking to Sky News this morning, she said it was important for people to distinguish between balanced conversations about immigration, and rhetoric such as Hanson’s that fuels division and targets minority groups.
“I was speaking just last night to a Muslim friend in south-west Sydney, and we’re talking about this and how it’s making the community feel. And then we talked about immigration and the need to separate what’s going on right now when it comes to the so-called ISIS brides, and when it comes to immigration, the impacts that immigration, more broadly, has on communities like ours in western Sydney.
“So these are two fundamentally different things that are getting caught up together, and Pauline Hanson is taking opportunity with that, and I think a lot of Australians don’t like it,” McIntosh said.

‘What a fall from grace’: Butler reacts to Mountbatten-Windsor arrest
By Brittany Busch
Staying with Butler, the health minister has agreed with King Charles, saying the law must take its course after the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince.
“There’s not much we can appropriately say about the potential for charges, but… what a fall from grace,” Butler told Seven’s Sunrise.
“A man we knew for decades as Prince Andrew, His Royal Highness, is now just a man in his 60s from Norfolk.”
Butler added his thoughts were with the women who were victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.
Mountbatten-Windsor has been arrested over alleged misconduct in public office while UK trade envoy, not sex offences.

Denying passports to citizens difficult, says Butler, as IS brides scrutiny continues
By Brittany Busch
Health Minister Mark Butler said Australia could deny issuing passports on national security grounds but that the threshold to legally do so was high.
Speaking about the 34 women and children seeking repatriation to Australia after being interned in Syria following the death or imprisonment of their Islamic State fighter family members, Butler told Seven’s Sunrise the situation was not as simple as the opposition was suggesting.
“The grounds are very specific, and they’re very tight, and they’re determined ultimately by national security agencies,” Butler said.
He said they were the same passport laws that were operating when the former Morrison government repatriated “about 40 people”, including fighters.
“I’m sure Angus Taylor knows that there are very strict constitutions on what any government – Labor or Liberal – is able to do in the area of citizenship and passports. Of course, we’re open to suggestions and discussions constructively with the opposition, but I think they know that it’s not that easy. It’s not as easy as they seem to be suggesting.”

Hanson should be charged for hate speech, says Canterbury-Bankstown mayor
By Emily Kaine
One Nation’s Pauline Hanson should be charged for hate speech for inciting violence against Muslim Australians, says Canterbury-Bankstown mayor Bilal El-Hayek.
“When you look at the hate speech laws, they’re quite clear,” he told ABC radio this morning.
“There is specific reference made of public incitement of hatred, discrimination or violence against particular groups based on race, religion or gender. Clearly, her target was Muslim people, and I have no doubt that her remarks will incite someone.”
Hanson said on Monday night there were “no good Muslims”. In another interview on Wednesday, she singled out Lakemba – a suburb in Canterbury-Bankstown home to a large Muslim community– as a place she “can’t go into” because she was “unwanted there”.
The One Nation leader has faced widespread condemnation for the remarks from across the political spectrum. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese yesterday labelled the remarks “disgraceful”, and drew a direct link between her commentary and escalating threats of violence towards minority groups.

Independent MP says she probed government for answers on IS brides
By Emily Kaine
Independent MP Dai Le this morning said she had probed the government multiple times about 34 Australian IS brides and their children being held in a camp in Syria.
“I have raised this question about the ISIS brides to both the prime minister and to the minister for home affairs last term and again earlier this year, and both have denied any support to bringing these families home. But of course, there has to be some involvement,” Le said on Channel Nine.
“I find it surprising that after last term, now the prime minister is coming out so strongly against it, why’s he taking that stand now, as opposed to when we were asking him that question of should those IS brides be brought back home?”
The government has maintained it is providing no assistance to the women and children, who are Australian citizens, to return home.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said earlier this week that the group had been issued valid Australian passports, prompting accusations from the opposition the government was helping the cohort return.

Former deputy PM weighs in on Andrew’s arrest
By Emily Kaine
As the world reels from the shock arrest of former royal Andrew Mountbatten Windsor overnight, Australians are beginning to weigh in on the deepening scandal this morning.
Former deputy prime minister Wayne Swan has responded to the historical arrest, saying he was surprised but it was an important step in holding the powerful to account.
“Nobody should be above the law, and it’s important the rich and powerful are held to account … there’s a suspicion that the powerful get away with a lot, so I think a lot of people will be surprised with this turn of events.
“I was pretty surprised,” he told Nine’s Today show during a regular morning appearance.
Swan is the Australian Labor Party president, and held the position of deputy prime minister from 2010-2013.

Trump tells Board of Peace he’ll decide on bombing Iran within 10 days
By Michael Koziol
US President Donald Trump says he will likely decide whether to launch strikes against Iran within the next 10 days, as he continues the biggest American military build-up in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Trump made the remarks in Washington at the first meeting of the Board of Peace, a new international alliance convened by him and that has so far been snubbed by a number of major US allies, including Australia.
“Iran is a hotspot right now,” Trump said. “Good talks are being had. It’s proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.”
The president referred to his strikes in June on Iran’s major nuclear facilities, which he said had decimated the Islamic Republic’s ability to develop nuclear weapons and cleared the way for a deal to end Israel’s war in Gaza.
“Now we may have to take a step further, or we may not,” Trump said. “Maybe we’re going to make a deal. But you’re going to be finding out over the next, probably, 10 days.”

BRUSSELS ― The EU is planning to spend as much as €16 million over the next four years to fly its top officials by private jet, according to a tender document.
This is an increase of €3 million from the previous four-year period and is 50 percent higher than the period before that, which ended in 2021.
"In a time where ordinary people can't afford traveling during their summer holidays, this sends a very weird signal," said Green MEP Rasmus Andresen. It's "embarrassing," and "doesn't fit" the EU's climate goals.

Kenyan families demand return of loved ones recruited into Russian army
Official intelligence report revealed that more than 1,000 citizens had been lured to fight for Russia in Ukraine.
Families of Kenyans allegedly tricked into fighting for Russia in Ukraine are demanding their return as an official intelligence report revealed that more than 1,000 citizens had been lured onto the front line.
Dozens of families protested in Nairobi on Thursday to demand the government take action, one day after the country’s National Intelligence Service unveiled a report on the scam, which allegedly involved a network of rogue state officials colluding with trafficking syndicates to dupe locals.

Winnie Rose Wambui said she hoped to get information about her brother, Samuel Maina, who went to Russia believing he had a job as a security guard at a mall. She last heard from him in October when he sent a “distress voice note” from a forest, she told news agency AFP.
Parliament Majority Leader Kimani Ichung’wah presented the intelligence report to the Parliament of Kenya on Wednesday, saying that more than 1,000 Kenyans had been recruited “to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war”, with 89 currently on the front line, 39 hospitalised and 28 missing in action.
The families plan to present petitions to several government offices, including the Foreign Ministry, and to the Russian embassy, according to their coordinator Peter Kamau, whose brother, Gerald Gitau, is missing.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not helping us,” said Wambui at Thursday’s protests, which called for the return of 35 recruits. “They told us if we have questions, we have go to the Kenyan embassy in Moscow.”
The Russian embassy in Kenya posted a statement on X, saying the government had “never engaged in illegal recruitment of Kenyan citizens in the Armed Forces”, dubbing the allegations a “dangerous and misleading propaganda campaign”.
However, the statement added: “the Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces”.
Lured with job promises
Reports of African men being lured into Russia with promises of jobs as bodyguards and ending up on Ukraine’s front line have become more frequent in recent months.
The number of Kenyan recruits is far higher than the figure of “around 200” given by authorities in December.
The intelligence report said recruitment agencies colluded with rogue Kenyan airport staff, immigration and other state officials, and with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and at the Kenyan embassy in Moscow to facilitate travel.
Those enlisted initially left Kenya on tourist visas and travelled to Russia via Turkiye or the United Arab Emirates. The recruits started travelling via Uganda, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo after Kenya tightened surveillance at Nairobi airport.
While some were ex-soldiers leaving to become mercenaries, many were said to have been tricked by recruitment agencies targeting former soldiers, police officers and the unemployed with promises of monthly earnings of some 350,000 shillings ($2,715), along with bonuses of up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).
Kenya’s Foreign Ministry said last week that 27 Kenyans had been rescued after being stranded in Russia.
Kenya’s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi has said he plans to visit Russia next month for talks on the issue.

Zelensky on peace talks: Further steps will be determined at Friday meeting
He announced this in his nightly video address, Ukrinform reports.
"Today all members of our negotiating group will already be in Ukraine, and for tomorrow I have scheduled a special meeting with them regarding our next steps and decisions. There will be a report here in Kyiv on those aspects of the negotiations that should not be discussed over the phone. We will also define the further framework of talks with our partners – the American side, the Europeans – and with the Russian side," he said.
According to Zelensky, it is important that Europeans were present at the recent negotiations in Switzerland, as Europe's positions must also be taken into account.
Zelensky thanked members of the Ukrainian delegation for strictly adhering to their directives during the talks.
Following negotiations in Geneva, Zelensky stated that there had been progress on military issues, namely monitoring a ceasefire, while on political matters – territories, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and other sensitive issues – the positions of the parties remain different.

Macron tells Meloni to stay out of France's affairs after activist remark

A French prosecutor on Thursday requested homicide charges against seven individuals accused in the fatal beating of a far-right activist, a case that has sparked political outrage beyond France’s borders.
The tensions escalated to the point that President Emmanuel Macron urged Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French domestic matters.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on Feb. 12. Most of the 11 suspects who had been detained are from far-left movements.
Prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested "intentional homicide" charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any "disturbance to public order."
The killing has fuelled political tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and France's 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.
On Wednesday, Italy's far-right leader Meloni said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe."
Macron said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence" and called on all political parties to "clean up" their act.
"Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic."
Macron also suggested that everyone must "stay in their own lane," after Meloni lamented "a climate of ideological hatred."
"I'm always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don't want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what's happening elsewhere," Macron said, while on a visit to New Delhi.
Italy's foreign minister hit back, saying the killing of the French activist "is a serious matter that concerns us all."
Antonio Tajani said on the social media platform X there had been similar incidents in Italy's history, and that condemning such violence aims "to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past."
He said "there have been many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the Republic."
Macron is "closely monitoring" events, a member of his team said on Thursday. "We must avoid any spiral of violence."
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing.
Lyon prosecutor Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two have refused to speak while in custody.
Others have acknowledged being at the scene and "some admit to having struck blows," but he added, they all dispute having had any homicidal intent.
Four suspects have been released, but more are being sought, Dran said.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphael Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.
A lawyer for Deranque's parents said they called "for calm and restraint."
"The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence," Fabien Rajon told broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard-left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far-right from power.
But following Deranque's killing some high-profile politicians sought to distance themselves from the hard-left, ruling out any possible futue alliance.
Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin called on Arnault to "draw the consequences" if the judiciary "finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired."
LFI party coordinator Manuel Bompard said that Arnault would "certainly not" be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the National Assembly lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

DHS Pushes for Detention of Refugees While Cases Are Reviewed

Cyber CEO released to house arrest after shooting 15-year-old

The Central District Court in Lod on Thursday rejected a police appeal and ordered the release to house arrest of the CEO of a cyber company suspected of shooting a 15-year-old boy near Yavne. The suspect had been held in custody for 10 days.
Judge Abbas Assi ruled that the executive would remain under house arrest until Feb. 24. “The wall of silence is deafening,” police said in response to the decision.
The shooting occurred last week in Moshav Ben Zakai in central Israel. According to an initial investigation, residents suspected the teenager and his friends of attempting to break into a building. A confrontation developed, during which the cyber company CEO — who serves in a local civilian emergency response squad — was stabbed and sustained very light injuries.
Police allege that in response, he drew his weapon and shot the teenager. The boy’s friends drove him toward a gas station at the southern exit of Yavne. The teen himself called police and reported that he had been shot in the abdomen.
The CEO is suspected of discharging a weapon in a built-up area and obstructing an investigation.
His attorneys, Gilad Baum and Hedva Baum, said their client is “a salt-of-the-earth Israeli” whom police are portraying as a criminal. They described him as a commander in the local emergency squad with no criminal record, a police volunteer, a firearms instructor and a holder of high-level security clearance.
“He responded to a WhatsApp alert from the moshav about three masked individuals entering,” his lawyers said. “From his perspective, he arrived at what he believed was a terrorist incident. During the event he was stabbed in the thigh. He is in severe emotional distress.”
They added that even after days of investigation, police have not fully clarified what happened. “He left his home as a member of the emergency squad believing there was a terrorist infiltration. He was stabbed in the leg, and the single shot may have been accidental discharge — possibly self-defense.”
During the hearing, Gilad Baum said: “A salt-of-the-earth Israeli goes out as part of an emergency squad established by police to defend the moshav. From his perspective this was a terrorist incident. Let us not forget we are after Oct. 7. He finds himself entangled, and police are acting as if they caught a criminal.”
Judge Assi, after reviewing investigative materials from the Shfela District police unit, appeared to question the sequence of events. According to statements made in court, investigators are still uncertain who stabbed the emergency squad member — an injury that allegedly led to the shooting.
A police representative argued there was concern the suspect could obstruct the investigation if released. He said that despite multiple opportunities, the emergency squad member did not report the incident to the police emergency hotline.
“Everything points to a wall of silence between him and others in the moshav,” the police representative said. “He did not activate the emergency squad. Everything happened in the dark. There is a public interest in getting to the truth.”
A resident of the moshav defended the suspect, saying, “They are treating him like the worst of criminals. We are ashamed of what was done to him. Suddenly masked men who arrive in a moshav at midnight become teenagers who came to spray graffiti. It hurts us. He is an amazing person. On his own initiative he would guard outside the synagogue to give us a sense of security. Let it be known that anyone who holds a weapon as part of an emergency squad could get into trouble and be left alone.”
The court imposed a gag order on the CEO’s identity, citing his security-related occupation.

Taylor walks a tightrope on immigration policy as Hanson surges

Can Angus Taylor get beyond slogans to craft a sound immigration policy?
This week, we pressed the rewind button on the Pauline tape, back to Hanson maxing out with inflammatory statements about Muslims, attracting a blaze of publicity and widespread outrage.
Or, given One Nation's surging polls, have we pushed the fast-forward button to when Hanson's party joins the big league? The March 21 South Australian election, followed by the Farrer by-election for Sussan Ley's seat, will provide clues.
Hanson told Sky on Monday, "I've got no time for the radical Islam. Their religion concerns me because of what it says in the Koran. They hate Westerners, and that's what it's all about. You say, 'Oh well, there's good Muslims out there.' I'm sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?"
She subsequently only partially qualified her blanket condemnation of Muslims.
Her extreme comments left Barnaby Joyce, her new recruit, uncomfortable. They also brought notable pushback from prominent Nationals senator Matt Canavan.
The Liberals and Nationals will be going head-to-head against One Nation in Farrer. They will need to take it on robustly.
Hanson is exploiting rifts in Australia's social cohesion while tearing further a fabric in its poorest shape in recent memory. As the Muslim community this week entered Ramadan, with threats made to the Lakemba Mosque, Hanson's outbursts will make the security agencies even more nervous.
The Middle East conflict took a big toll on our cohesion. The Jewish community suffered attacks amid soaring antisemitism, culminating in the horrific Bondi massacre. Incidents against Muslims increased. Demonstrations divided the public. Many Australians are on edge. Tensions have escalated, and tolerance has plummeted.
We see this in the blow-up over the so-called ISIS brides and their children, who want to come to Australia.
The debate isn't new.
It stretches back to the prime ministership of Scott Morrison and the repatriation of a handful of children. Morrison condemned the parents for a "despicable" act in putting them in harm's way, but said "the children can't be held responsible for that".
The Coalition, eyeing voters lost to One Nation, is demanding the brides and their families never get here. When asked about the children, Liberals acknowledge their situation but say it is their parents' fault.
For his part, Anthony Albanese has now toughened his rhetoric, declaring: "My mother would have said if you make your bed, you lie in it."
"Shut the door!" Angus Taylor says, offering to support fresh legislation if necessary. The keep-them-out chorus will play well with many people, especially in the present climate. The women joined terrorists fighting against Australia's interests and values.
Moreover, there are increasing questions about how honest the government has been in what it said and did in reacting to lobbying to get them home. It still has much to answer.
But on the substantive issue, these are Australian citizens and as such are entitled to come to Australia. (Though there are legal provisions for exclusion orders on security advice, and the government has taken that route with one person. There are also some other legal loopholes in relation to granting passports.)
Australia claims the right to demand that countries should take back their citizens when we deport them under our laws. Legislation was passed last year to potentially penalise those who refuse to do so.
Loading...In the same way, Australia should recognise its obligations to accept its own citizens, however much it mightn't want to do so. This goes beyond legality — it is also a moral responsibility.
But, the critics shout, they pose a risk. To a degree, perhaps, including because some of the older children may have been radicalised. But whatever risk there might be is one that could be managed.
The cohort is fewer than three dozen. Women who have broken Australia's law by their actions should be charged when they return; the others, including minors, where necessary, should be monitored by police and ASIO. It's not ideal, but if you admit the moral argument, it's the price we pay.
LoadingIt's against the backdrop of today's hyped-up community feeling that Angus Taylor will craft an immigration policy that he will presumably release ahead of the Farrer by-election.
Devising the policy will be harder than his slick slogan condemning the government's policy — "numbers too high, standards too low" — as he is pulled between good policy and populist politics.
The policy has two dimensions: the size and composition of the intake and the issue of ensuring people accept and fit with Australian "values".
The government already has migration numbers coming down. Net overseas migration was 306,000 in 2024-25, down from 429,000 a year earlier. The budget projected 260,000 in 2025-26. The opposition wants it lower.
But it is tricky when it comes to the details. Cutting the permanent skilled migration intake would be bad for business and the economy — although the points system seems totally out of whack when people get points for characteristics that have nothing to do with their likely economic and social contribution to Australia.
Reducing those on temporary visas is also difficult. The care economy and many businesses rely heavily on these workers. Are there too many students? Perhaps — but universities need their fees: in 2024 they provided more than a quarter of their revenue.
Education is also a huge export industry. What about backpackers? But how would many farmers cope without them? There are multiple stakeholders Taylor's policy will have to consider in slicing numbers.
The "values" side of the policy will be even harder. A draft policy prepared in the Ley office proposed designating regions where terrorist organisations have sustained control, banning people coming from them for a period. Home Affairs and Immigration spokesman Jonno Duniam says this is not part of the policy now being worked on.
Whatever the scope of toughening scrutiny of migrant entry, permanent residency, and citizenship, ensuring people have the right values remains an elusive quest. One of the Bondi shooters came from India and had been here for decades; his son, who faced court this week, was born an Australian. There are no guarantees, and sometimes it's a matter of vigilance.
The values people arrive with are important, but they need constant reinforcement across all parts of society, including through the education and political systems.
As part of this, a lot more political attention should be paid to our multiculturalism which is at risk of a serious unravelling. Multiculturalism requires social licence, and among some Australians, that licence is diminishing before our eyes.

What’s next for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson?

While the spotlight has been on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, his arrest has prompted questions about what is next for his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson.
Ferguson, known by the tabloids as Fergie, married the then prince Andrew in 1986 and was divorced from him 10 years later after an alleged affair with an American financial adviser. It was one of multiple scandals in the 1990s and 2000s involving the former duchess, who was widely considered an embarrassment to the royal family.
Ferguson has stood by Mountbatten-Windsor through waves of allegations produced by his links to Jeffrey Epstein, though she was yet to comment on his arrest on Thursday.
She has previously described him as “amazing” and said they were “the happiest divorced couple in the world”, later rejecting the claims against him and calling his alleged victim Virginia Giuffre a liar.
While Ferguson’s ties to Mountbatten-Windsor have kept her adjacent to the Epstein scandal, it is her own closeness to the convicted sex offender that is threatening to make her persona non grata in the public sphere as more details come to light.
News of the former prince’s arrest came only days after it was revealed that six of Ferguson’s businesses are set to be struck off the register of Companies House, after becoming dormant. It is not clear what each of them did, but one appeared to be a public relations business, while another appeared to be in the retail sector.
Ferguson, whose money problems have been well documented over the years, and who has struggled to be financially independent, exchanged many emails with Epstein, even after he was convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
A string of revelations have uncovered Ferguson’s financial ties – even an alleged dependence – on Epstein. The allegations have also opened up questions about the funding of the lifestyles of her daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, now in their 30s, who were pictured going on lavish holidays during their 20s while working relatively low-paid jobs.
Ferguson has been involved in several scandals that appeared to be attempts to cash in on her royal connections, including two tell-all memoirs, in 1996 and 2011, and in 2010 when she was exposed in a News of the World sting operation attempting to sell access to her former husband in return for £500,000. She told Mazher Mahmood, who was undercover as the “Fake Sheikh”, that she would “open any door you want”, promising him he would get his investment back tenfold.
Later apologising for the scandal, Ferguson said it was “true my finances are under stress”.
The Epstein files, the tranche of documents gathered by US authorities in the investigation into the disgraced financier, have shown some of the extent to which she financially depended on the friendship with him, including evidence he wired Ferguson $150,000 (£104,000) in 2001, which she said was for share options she had earned as an “ambassador” for Weight Watchers, which had gone public earlier that year.
She initially claimed to have cut ties with Epstein as soon as she became aware of the allegations against him in 2006. However, emails contained in the US department of justice files showed she maintained her closeness with him.
“Cannot wait to see you,” she wrote in one email in 2009. Another email between Epstein and his assistant showed he paid $14,080 to fly Ferguson and her two daughters, then 19 and 20, to the US for lunch.
Days later she wrote to him: “Thank you Jeffrey for being the brother I have always wished for.”
The following year, in another email, she wrote: “You are a legend.” Later in the same email, she added: “I am at your service. Just marry me.”
Nine months later, Ferguson publicly apologised for her association with him, saying in an interview with the Evening Standard newspaper: “I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf.”
But in private, the former duchess emailed Epstein to “humbly apologise” for denouncing him publicly, calling him “a supreme friend to me and my family”.
Later, when the conversation became public, she told the media she had sent that email to him to “assuage Epstein and his threats”.
When the US government released the first tranche of Epstein files in September last year, a number of charities associated with the then duchess cut ties with her, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the children’s hospice Julia’s House, both of which she was patron.
The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation issued a statement saying the charity was “disturbed” to read her comments, and also dropped her as a patron.
Nothing uncovered in the files has indicated any criminal activity by Ferguson, who appeared to stop using the duchess title when her ex-husband was stripped of his title, though it may be one scandal too many.

MINSK, February 19. /TASS/. The United States did not issue entry visas to members of the Belarusian delegation to the Board of Peace meeting, despite the fact that Minsk complied with all necessary procedures, the Belarusian foreign ministry said.
According to the ministry, the Belarusian side in due time informed the meeting’s organizers that in accordance with President Alexander Lukashenko’s decision, the country will be represented by Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov. All necessary formal notifications were sent to the US protocol services as per established procedures. The documents for visas were submitted well in advance. "But despite the fact that we fulfilled all required procedures, our delegation was not issued visas," the ministry said.
"In this situation, we have a logical question: what kind of peace and what kind of consistency are they talking about when the organizers failed to carry out even basic formalities for our participation? And it was US president [Donald Trump] that sent an invitation to take part in the Board of Peace meeting to the Belarusian head of state. Enough said," the ministry added.

Trump outlines global commitments to rebuild Gaza during Board of Peace debut
The gathering in Washington comes as Trump seeks to cultivate a reputation as a peacemaker, even as the US escalates threats against Iran and bolsters its military presence in the region

- CommentsGo to comments
U.S. President Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday, announcing that nations had pledged $7 billion towards a Gaza reconstruction fund.
The ambitious initiative aims to rebuild the war-torn enclave, but hinges on the disarmament of Hamas, an objective currently far from realisation. The gathering in Washington comes as Trump seeks to cultivate a reputation as a peacemaker, even as the United States escalates threats against Iran and bolsters its military presence in the region.
The substantial sum for Gaza’s recovery was reportedly contributed by countries including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait. Trump also declared that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace, though he did not specify the source of these funds or whether congressional approval would be sought. Further pledges included: $75 million from FIFA for football-related projects in Gaza and $2 billion from the United Nations for humanitarian assistance. These figures, however, fall significantly short of the estimated $70 billion required to rebuild Gaza, which has been devastated by two years of conflict.
The Board’s membership is predominantly comprised of Middle Eastern nations, alongside leaders from outside the region who may be seeking to curry favour with Trump.
Notably, some key Western allies, concerned about the initiative's scope, are absent. While Israel is a member, Palestinian representatives are not included. Trump’s suggestion that the Board’s remit could extend beyond Gaza to address other global "hotspots" has sparked anxiety that it might undermine the United Nations' established role in international diplomacy.
Despite this, Trump asserted, "We're going to strengthen the United Nations," even as the US faces arrears in its payments to the global body. Norway, initially cited by Trump as a host for a Board event, later clarified it was not joining the initiative.
A significant component of the plan involves the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to Gaza. Trump stated that several nations are preparing to send thousands of troops, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announcing a contribution of up to 8,000 personnel.
This force, led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, is intended to begin operations in Israeli-controlled areas, starting with Rafah, to train a new police force. The ultimate goal, according to Trump, is to prepare 12,000 police officers and deploy 20,000 troops.
The disarmament of Hamas remains a critical and contentious issue. Trump expressed hope that force would not be necessary, claiming Hamas had promised to disarm and "looks like they're going to be doing that, but we'll have to find out." However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning, stating, "Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma - to disarm peacefully or disarmed forcefully."
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem indicated that any international force must "monitor the ceasefire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression," adding that disarmament could be discussed without a direct commitment. Hamas, which has resumed administration of the enclave, claims it is ready to hand over to a US-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats, but alleges Israel has blocked their entry into Gaza.
The Board of Peace meeting unfolded against a backdrop of heightened tensions with Iran. Even as Trump presented himself as a proponent of peace, he maintained a hawkish stance towards Tehran, stating he expected to know within 10 days whether a "meaningful deal" to end the standoff was possible. The event itself reportedly bore the hallmarks of a Trump campaign rally, complete with blaring music from his eclectic playlist and attendees receiving red Trump hats.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio underscored the gravity of the situation, stating, "We have to get this right. There is no plan B for Gaza. Plan B is going back to war. No one here wants that." The path forward for the Board of Peace, particularly regarding Hamas disarmament and the broader geopolitical landscape, presents considerable challenges.

Five Key Takeaways From Trump’s First Gaza Board of Peace Meeting
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
19:32:32 UTC
04:32:32 KST

President Donald Trump convened the inaugural meeting of his newly formed Board of Peace at the United States Institute of Peace headquarters on Thursday, unveiling funding pledges and outlining plans for Gaza’s reconstruction.
Trump first announced the initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, presenting it as part of Phase Two of his U.N.-endorsed 20-point peace plan for Gaza. He invited dozens of countries to join the board.
But several close U.S. allies have hesitated to participate or refused to do so, amid concerns that the structure could sideline the United Nations. Reports that permanent membership would be granted to countries that contribute $1 billion in cash within the first year have also raised questions about whether authoritarian governments could gain influence within the body.
The meeting brought together Trump, who serves as chairman of the board, Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and representatives from participating countries. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was the only attendee not serving in a political role.
Trump opened by praising board members and criticizing allies who have not joined the initiative, accusing them of “playing cute.”
Here are five key takeaways from the meeting.
Trump vowed $10 billion U.S. commitment
Trump announced that the United States would contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace.
“The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room,” he said. “I want to let you know that the United States is going to make a contribution of $10 billion to the Board of Peace.”
He did not clarify whether his Administration has formally requested congressional approval for the funds, which would be required.
“We've had great support for that number,” Trump added. “That number is a very small number. When you look at that compared to the cost of war, that's two weeks of fighting, it's a very small number.”
Five nations pledged boots on the ground
General Jasper Jeffers, appointed commander of the planned International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza, said Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, and Albania have committed troops to the force. Egypt and Jordan, he said, have agreed to train police.
“For the last few months, we've had a team on the ground of U.S. military experts preparing the infrastructure for the ISF,” Jeffers said. “This team is already operating from a combined joint operation center that's going to be the headquarters for the entire ISF.”
He said the force will operate across five sectors, beginning in Rafah. The “midterm objective is to continue to expand sector by sector, all moving to our long term, 12,000 police and 20,000 ISF soldiers,” he said.
Jeffers also confirmed that Indonesia will serve as deputy commander of the ISF.
Nine nations pledged $7 billion in relief
Trump announced that nine countries had pledged a combined $7 billion toward Gaza relief.
“I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7 billion toward the relief package,” he said.
The pledges come amid a fragile cease-fire in Gaza following the initial phases of Trump’s 20-point peace plan. According to Gaza’s health ministry, 603 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes since the cease-fire deal brokered by Trump and mediated by Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt came into effect on Oct. 10, 2025.
Trump also said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance has agreed to raise an additional $2 billion “for the support of Gaza.” Japan will host fundraising events for the Board of Peace, Trump said, with expected participation from South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, China, and Russia.
Additionally, “FIFA will be helping to raise a total of $75 million for projects in Gaza,” Trump said.
Board of Peace will be ‘looking over’ U.N., Trump says
Trump suggested the Board of Peace would effectively oversee the United Nations.
“The United Nations is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly,” he said.
While saying he was “working very closely” with the U.N., Trump added that the organization has not lived up to its “tremendous potential.”
The remarks come as U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has warned the body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless member states reform funding rules or pay outstanding dues. The U.S. currently owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year.
“We're going to strengthen the United Nations. We're going to make sure its facilities are good. They need help, and they need help money wise. We're going to help them money wise,” Trump said, without specifying an amount.
Iran remains a central tension point
Throughout the meeting, Trump repeatedly described Iran as a “threat” to “the stability of the entire region.”
“Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we're doing, and if they join us, that will be great. If they don't join us, that will be great too, but it will be a very different path,” he said. “They cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region, and they must make a deal. If that doesn't happen, maybe I can understand, but bad things will happen.”
The warning comes amid mounting speculation about possible U.S. military action against Iran. The U.S. has expanded its military presence in the region. Trump confirmed that the U.S. has ordered 22 additional B-2 stealth bombers, the same aircraft previously used to strike three Iranian nuclear sites.
“We do have some work to do with Iran. They can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple,” Trump said. “They can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon. And they can't have a nuclear weapon. And they've been told that very strongly.”
Trump added that whether a deal is reached, or whether the U.S. will need to “take it a step further,” should become clear “probably over the next 10 days.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna of California said he and Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky will seek a vote next week to limit the President’s ability to use force against Iran without congressional approval.“Trump officials say there's a 90% chance of strikes on Iran. He can’t without Congress,” Khanna wrote on social media. A similar effort failed last June, nearly a week after the President ordered strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities without consulting Congress.

Rescue group in Las Vegas tries to catch a toucan that escaped its owner before it's too late

Rescue group in Las Vegas tries to catch a toucan that escaped its owner before it's too late
The life of a toucan seen flying around the Las Vegas desert is at risk unless it can be captured soon
- Bookmark
Katherine Eddington was driving in North Las Vegas last week when she thought she saw a big black bird carrying a banana fly across the intersection.
But after a closer look, she realized it was a toucan — a tropical bird native to rainforests in Central and South America known for their large, colorful bills.
“They’re beautiful birds, so being able to see something like that so close to home was fascinating,” said Eddington, who recognized the bird from social media and contacted animal rescue.
That toucan is named Sam, and he has been living in the area since November, when a resident posted online that he'd escaped from his cage. After surviving the Las Vegas desert for months, Sam has captivated community birding groups, with people posting occasional sightings around town.
A local rescue group has been trying to catch him for months — and the clock is ticking.
“I’m really worried about him,” said Skye Marsh, president and co-founder of SouthWest Exotic Avian Rescue. The Las Vegas-based group has spent hours searching for him, only to find the bird 50 feet (about 15 meters) up in a palm tree, limiting rescue options. They have not been in touch with the owner, she said.
Las Vegas is not a good environment for a toucan to be in the wild with its too-hot summers and cold winters, said Donald Price, a professor and biologist at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas who studies how winged animal species adapt to different environments.
Marsh, who has two toucans of her own, said Sam is starting to show signs of struggle. His eyes are sunken in, and the skin around his beak is starting to get discolored, she said.
Sam likely lived off figs and pomegranates from trees in the Los Prados neighborhood, located about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the Las Vegas Strip, when he first escaped in November, Marsh said. Those fruits have since disappeared, and Sam has moved on to citrus, which are harmful to toucans, she said. Their livers cannot process the calcium, and the iron can be deadly.
“This bird is not in good shape,” Marsh said.
Bird experts and enthusiasts alike are surprised the toucan has survived so long in Las Vegas. Exotic birds that escape often have difficulty finding food and avoiding predators, and the changing weather in Las Vegas has also likely taken a toll on the toucan.
Birds can thermal regulate, but only for so long. It takes a lot of energy, so the toucan would need more food, Price said.
“If it’s still alive, it could be in trouble, I can imagine. So hopefully they catch it," he said.
The toucan has been spotted in one specific location, a sign he’s running out of energy, she said. The rescue group set up a cage with food in it and urged neighbors to stop feeding it. The toucan has scoped out the cage but gets spooked when people are around, Marsh said.
The rescue group will rush him to the vet as soon as he's caught, Marsh said. He’ll need fluids, and his system will need to be flushed to remove the iron he’s eaten.
Marsh urged neighbors to not get close to the toucan or try to trap Sam themselves.
“The more people that are out there, the worse it’s going to be because he doesn’t like people,” she said. “So just let us do our thing, and we’ll get him.”

Will this helmet prevent concussions in footballers?

Study to test whether a new helmet will significantly reduce risk of concussion in football players
It's getting toward the pointy end of pre-season for the Brighton Bombers senior women's football squad.
Before training, their strength and conditioning coach, Kelley, takes them through a meticulous warm-up: high knees, grapevine and sprints.
"It's just to prevent injury, mainly," says Lily, 20, who is sweating after the run-throughs.
"One wrong movement can cause a torn muscle or something like that."
It makes sense. An injury can derail any athlete's preparation.
So can a concussion, and repeated concussions can have significant long-term consequences. So what do these players do to protect their heads?
"Nothing, if I'm honest. I've never worn a helmet or anything like that," Bonnie, 19, admits.
"My parents have told me to before because I've had a few head knocks. But look, I just think it's part of the game sometimes, so I don't really do much to prevent it," she says.
A potential solution
"We want to achieve for concussion what seatbelts achieved for road safety."
That's the bold claim made by industrial designer Graeme Attey at the beginning of a promotional video for Australian sportswear company GameGear. In his hands is his latest invention, a helmet specifically designed to reduce an athlete's chance of getting concussion.
"It was actually back in 2012; it was a game of Friday night footy," says Attey, reflecting on the origin of his design.
"Two guys just went head to head and down cold, both of them, and I thought, 'That's it. This is ridiculous,' because I could just see that they don't need to suffer these sorts of injuries.
"If you design a helmet that's specifically made correctly for football, they shouldn't be suffering such severe concussions."
The AFL and NRL's treatment of concussions has shifted dramatically in the past decade. In 2021, the AFL introduced a mandatory minimum 12-day return-to-play period after a player receives a concussion. This was extended in 2024 to a 21-day minimum for community football.
Little focus has been paid to prevention, however.
"It's probably been our biggest frustration all along," Attey says.
"Initially, there was this issue of all the focus and money and everything … going into what do you do after someone's concussed? And we were waving our hands saying, 'But stop the concussions first before you treat them.'"
The result of Attey's frustration is a helmet made-up of a lattice of connecting spheres that, according to independent testing undertaken at the NSW Crash Lab, can reduce the force transmitted to a player's head during impact by more than 90 per cent.
"The reason I wanted to use spheres is because they have a progressive resistance to impact," Attey says.
A concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that occurs when force is transferred to the brain from a hit to the head or body.
Attey's helmet is designed to reduce the amount of force that is transferred to the brain.
"What causes a concussion is head acceleration. So what you want to do is slow the acceleration of the head because that's what is causing the concussion," he says.
"If you take a circle and then you compress it, when an impact first strikes through the cross-sections of the ball, there's not much resistance initially because it's only sort of the peak of the ball, and then as it squashes down and down, it becomes more and more resistant to the force."
Loading...What does the science say?
Across a range of sports, including Aussie Rules, soccer, rugby union, and a combination of those sports, the science appears settled: helmets are not associated with a reduced risk of concussion.
Attey says there's a reason for this.
"It all started back in 1993 with World Rugby in the UK deciding that they would allow headgear to be worn in rugby games, but it was to protect the ears in a scrum," he says.
These guidelines are still in place, and state that the only injuries that headgear should protect against are cuts and abrasions.
"So it actually stipulates it can't work," Attey says.
He says many helmets on the market have been made to adhere to these specifications, so it's no surprise the science says they do nothing for concussions.
"You hear over and over again in the press, people in the medical field saying helmets have been proven not to work. There's no point in wearing helmets, and yes, it's true, but they were testing helmets that we already knew didn't work," he says.
"So, there should never be a conclusion that because that occurred, therefore, no helmet is ever going to work, because it's just crazy.
"You know, no-one will get anywhere with that sort of attitude."
World-first concussion trial approved
While the GameGear helmets have had promising results in a laboratory setting, the next step is to test them in the field.
Over the next couple of years, scientists from Monash University, with support from non-profit organisation Connectivity Traumatic Brain Injury Australia, will study 600 players aged 16 and over who will wear the helmets during elite and community football and rugby games across the country.
The study will look at real-world exposure data, biomarkers and clinical assessments to help determine whether these helmets significantly reduce a player's risk of getting a concussion.
Adelaide University senior lecturer in exercise science Hunter Bennett is curious to see the results.
"This is actually a really interesting topic of research," Dr Bennett says.
"What we tend to see in laboratory settings is that those helmets really do a good job of preventing or reducing the amount of force that's transferred to the skull, and often to a pretty meaningful degree, or what you would think would be a meaningful degree.
"But then when it comes to research out in the field, we tend to see those helmets maybe not having as large an effect on reducing concussion as what we would expect."
Dr Bennett says hits during a game can be unpredictable, and every individual will have a different threshold for concussion.
"Maybe your force threshold is different to my force threshold. Maybe that force threshold reduces if you experience multiple head knocks in a game," he says.
"So maybe there's sort of an accumulated effect where we receive 10 head knocks in a game, and even though not a single one of them is really large, maybe accumulated, those 10 could result in a concussion occurring.
"There's so many things that occur throughout a duration of a game that just maybe the helmet does prevent some of those contributing factors to concussion, but it just can't impact all of them."
Attey says these variables are why the field trials are vital in determining whether his helmets will be an effective strategy in reducing concussion risk.
"Some guys will get a 100g [g-force] hit and be OK. Another guy will get a 60g hit and go down cold.
"We know the impacts will be reduced hugely out there on the field for any sort of head hit, but we just need to know how much overall, at the end of the day … that [will] reduce concussion."
Should helmets be mandated?
If, at the conclusion of Monash University's study, it is shown that these helmets unequivocally reduce a player's chance of getting a concussion, Attey says they should be a compulsory part of contact sport.
"It should be mandated everywhere if it's proven to reduce concussion because otherwise you can't say you're looking after the health and safety of the players."
Dr Bennett agrees, but with some caveats.
"I think you would have to sort of question if these helmets have a really, really robust effect on concussion," he said.
"You would almost make the sort of assumption that it's almost the duty of care to mandate it.
"But then I'm sure there's also going to be issues around funding, like these helmets aren't cheap.
"Do players take on that cost? Do parents? What if parents can't afford it? Then maybe it becomes an equity issue where only those players who can afford to buy these helmets can participate in the sport, and that's going to have a negative effect from a general health perspective."
No helmet is ever going to completely rule out a player's chance of getting concussion, and we are certainly a long way off any helmet being mandated.
But for some of the players at Brighton, it might be the only way they would wear one.
"I would also look into it because I've had a few knocks as well and a few concussions, but I don't think I would wear it straight away," Sava, 17, says.
"I feel like I'd have to get maybe one more and then be like, maybe?"
"I got concussed in 2021, so then after that, my parents made me wear a helmet for the rest of that season, but I took it off as soon as I could," says Milla, with notable disdain in her voice.
"It was quite embarrassing, I think, to be wearing a helmet as a girl because no-one else was wearing a helmet, and it's just, yeah, wasn't very flattering.
"I feel like if everyone was doing it, I would probably be able to get on board. I wouldn't feel so isolated."

Abigail Spanberger tapped to deliver Dem response to Trump’s State of the Union address
Spanberger became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year

Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address next week.
She was tapped for the rebuttal just months after resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican.
The Democratic rebuttal will immediately follow Trump’s address to Congress next Tuesday, offering the party’s most high-profile opportunity to deliver a countermessage.
Spanberger, who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families.
“Gov. Spanberger will lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in announcing Spanberger as the party’s pick that she “embodies the best of America as a mother, community leader and dedicated public servant.”
On the campaign trail last year, Spanberger also spoke out against the White House’s gutting of the civil service, an issue that hit particularly hard in Virginia, home to a large number of federal workers.
"Those who have devoted their lives to public service, you are worried about an administration that is gilding buildings while schools crumble, breaking the social safety net and sowing fear across our communities,” Spanberger said at her inauguration.
“Betraying the values of who we are as Americans.”
Last year’s record-breaking government shutdown also hit the state’s sizable federal workforce, leaving many employees without pay for weeks.
The federal government is once again partially shut down as Democratic leaders in Congress and the White House remain at an impasse over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The shutdown, which began Saturday, is likely to stretch into Trump’s address Tuesday, with no agreement in sight.
As a former CIA case officer, Spanberger has tied her political career to her public service and national security credentials.
She also has pitched herself as a mother of daughters educated in Virginia’s public schools and a Capitol Hill veteran who often worked across the aisle.
In the months since winning the election, she has vowed to work with the president when they are aligned, but also has taken more pointed digs at the White House.

Gaza administration committee opens applications to form new police force
Committee says planned force will be built on accountability, transparency and rule of law as it calls on qualified Palestinians to apply
By Hosni Nedim
ISTANBUL (AA) – The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) announced Thursday that it has opened applications to establish a new Palestinian police force in the Gaza Strip.
In a statement published on its website, the committee invited “qualified and committed individuals” to submit applications to serve the community and strengthen public security.
It said it aims to recruit Palestinian men and women with “high professional competence and a commitment to maintaining order and stability, supporting the rule of law and protecting society with discipline and national responsibility.”
The committee described joining the force as “a national duty and an active contribution to rebuilding trust and security within Gaza’s society.”
It said the recruitment process targets individuals who demonstrate “professionalism, integrity and a sense of public responsibility, to be at the forefront of protecting families, safeguarding human dignity and helping shape a more secure future for coming generations.”
The planned police force will be built on “solid foundations of accountability, transparency and respect for the law,” the committee said.
Members of the force will operate under “clear codes of conduct and continuous oversight and accountability,” the statement added.
The NCAG is a nonpolitical body formed under a Gaza plan proposed by US President Donald Trump. It is tasked with managing daily civil service affairs in the enclave.
It comprises 11 Palestinian figures and is led by Ali Shaath. The committee began operating from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in mid-January but has yet to start work inside Gaza, where about 2.4 million Palestinians face severe humanitarian conditions.
It has yet to begin operating from inside Gaza, despite Hamas saying it had completed logistical and administrative procedures to hand over civil governance duties.
Entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official explanation has been issued by the committee regarding the delay, and Israel has not commented on the matter.

Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown
Iranians grieve defiantly for thousands killed in last month’s crackdown
CAIRO (AP) — Standing on her balcony in the Iranian capital, Tehran, the teacher shouted out into the darkness, “Death to the dictator!” and “Death to the murderer, Khamenei!” on a recent night, joining the slogans coming from windows and rooftops around her relatively affluent neighborhood.
A few voices in the darkness responded with slogans in support of Iran’s 47-year-old Islamic Republic.
“Shut up! Choke on it!” her neighbors shouted back, drowning out the pro-government voices, the teacher recounted to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her safety.
Iranians across the country are still reeling with shock, grief and fear after massive nationwide protests were crushed by the deadliest crackdown ever seen under the rule of the 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Thousands were killed and tens of thousands are believed to have been arrested.
But a vein of defiance persists. A seething anger at Iran’s rulers is evident in videos shared on social media and in conversations with protesters. At the same time, three protesters reached by the AP also expressed futility over what can be done after hundreds of thousands braved taking to the streets only to be met with overwhelming violence. The protesters all spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution or arrest.
Adding to the uncertainty is the United States’ threat to strike Iran. The U.S. has positioned warships and fighter jets nearby even as it holds negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program.
The defiance appears in the shouting of slogans from windows and rooftops at night, a ritual displayed in past waves of protests.
It is also evident at memorial gatherings for those killed 40 days earlier. Such commemorations -- known as the “chehelom,” Persian for “the 40th” – are traditionally held by families for anyone who has died. But in times of unrest, chehelom can have a political dimension.
Commemorations turn to protests
This week marks 40 days since Jan. 8 and 9, the deadliest days of the crackdown, and multiple videos circulating online show 40-day ceremonies in towns and cities around Iran. Some appear to have drawn hundreds of people, who often break into anti-government chants.
Often they are festive, with friends and loved ones of the slain protester singing and throwing flowers – a rejection of the solemn atmosphere encouraged by the state at official ceremonies. Most avoid calling the dead “shaheed,” or “martyr,” a term with Islamic religious connotations. Instead, they use the term, “javid nam,” a Persian phrase meaning, “Long live the name.”
Videos posted this week and verified by the AP showed a crowd of hundreds at the main cemetery in the small western Iranian town of Abdanan, chanting, “Death to Khamenei” and pumping their fists at the chehelom of Alireza Seydi, a 16-year-old boy killed on Jan. 8. The videos show security forces firing from an armored vehicle, raising clouds of what appeared to be tear gas, sending men and women running.
During the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the shah and brought the Islamic Republic to power, 40-day memorials for slain protesters often turned into rallies that security forces tried to crush, causing new deaths – which then would be marked 40 days later with new protests.
Postings on social media have reported security forces trying to restrict people from attending some chehelom ceremonies.
“For every person killed, a thousand more stand behind him,” a crowd of several hundred chanted Tuesday while gathered in the eastern city of Mashhad for the chehelom of Hamid Mahdavi, according to a video verified by the AP. When a few police officers harassed some people commemorating Mahdavi, a fireman shot to death in January protests, the crowd shouted, “Shameless! Shameless!”
The government held its own chehelom for those killed, whom the Revolutionary Guard in a statement depicted as victims of violence caused by foreign-backed armed “terrorist” groups that exploited “legitimate public demands.” It said the 40-day commemoration was “a chance to renew commitment to national unity.”
‘Mass depression’ and anger
“More than sad, people are angry. Everyone is so angry. Everyone is waiting for some kind of explosion,” said a resident of Karaj, a city just outside of Tehran.
He joined street marches on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9 and said five of his relatives and family friends were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters.
The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and believes the death toll is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed; it has depicted many of the protesters as “terrorists.”
“I don’t know anyone around me who doesn’t know someone who was killed, or someone who was arrested or wounded,” the 26-year-old teacher in Tehran said. Two of her acquaintances were killed and the husband of one of her co-workers arrested, she said.
Iranians are also struggling with a rapidly worsening economy, as the value of their currency plummets.
Every day, prices rise, said the Karaj resident. “We are getting near an economic collapse,” he said. “Buying fruit has become a luxury.”
A resident of north Tehran who works in tourism and joined last month’s protests said that with the Persian New Year approaching in March, the bazaar would usually be full of shoppers, but not now.
“It’s a combination of grieving, lack of money and inflation,” he said, describing people in the capital as being in a state of “mass depression.”
The mood has dampened Iran’s normally vibrant cultural sphere. One prominent actor posted that she would no longer accept new roles “in this land that smells of blood.”
Alireza Ostad Haji, who referees a popular television strongman competition, offered condolences to “all mourning families” in an Instagram post and resigned from two national athletic committees. He broke down in tears as he spoke of a former bodybuilding champion, Masoud Zatparvar, who was killed. “He was not a terrorist, he was a protester,” he said.
‘They see no alternative’
There is also a fear that street protests can’t bring change in the face of the state’s overwhelming use of violence.
The Karaj resident and the Tehran protester who works in tourism both expressed support for the son of the ousted shah, Reza Pahlavi, who from exile has put himself forward as a leader of the fragmented Iranian opposition. Pahlavi has encouraged protests and called for the U.S. to strike Iran.
The depth of support for Pahlavi around Iran is impossible to gauge. But during January’s wave of protests, chants in support of him were common, a notable change from the past, when the shah’s son drew scant attention within the country or was seen as out of touch.
Some are even taking what was a previously unimaginable step for many -- expressing hopes for an American attack.
“Every night, every hour, I wish I could hear (U.S.) strikes,” the protester who works in tourism said. “We cannot fight anymore with our fists against machine guns.” He said many of his friends who took to the streets alongside him in January say they won’t do so again because of the state’s violence.
The teacher said that, while she joined past protests, she didn’t in January because she didn’t like the expressions of Pahlavi support.
But she said some of her friends who also oppose the shah’s son joined the January protests and even repeated the slogan, “Long live the shah!”
“People have become very tired, and they see no alternative,” she said.
She worried a U.S. attack will bring war, civil strife and even more bloodshed.
“I am afraid there will be more massacres,” she said.

Trump extends sanctions against Russia over war in Ukraine for another year
This is stated in the president's official notice published in the Federal Register, which is set to take effect on March 6, Ukrinform reports.
"In accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660," the document reads.
The notice specifies that the national emergency related to the situation in Ukraine remains in effect. It covers sanctions introduced in March and December 2014, as well as in September 2018 and February 2022, under executive orders issued by previous U.S. presidents.
U.S. executive orders declaring a national emergency and imposing sanctions on foreign states remain in force for one year. They must then be renewed by a separate order from the president to remain in effect for another year.

Scientists develop universal vaccine to protect against allergies, cold and flu
The vaccine could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections and may even work against new pandemic bugs

- CommentsGo to comments
A universal vaccine that can protect against cold, flu, Covid and allergies is a significant step closer, scientists believe.
Stanford Medicine researchers in the US have tested a vaccine formula on mice that protects against a range of respiratory viruses, bacteria which causes sepsis and even house dust mites.
The vaccine is delivered through a nasal spray and provides broad protection in the lungs for several months.
If this vaccine was developed for humans it could replace multiple jabs every year for winter respiratory infections and may even work against new pandemic bugs.
“I think what we have is a universal vaccine against diverse respiratory threats,” Dr Bali Pulendran, director of the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford Medicine and lead author said.
“Imagine getting a nasal spray in the fall months that protects you from all respiratory viruses including Covid-19, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and the common cold, as well as bacterial pneumonia and early spring allergens,” Dr Pulendran said. “That would transform medical practice.”
For the study published in the journal Science, mice were given a drop of the vaccine, known as GLA-3M-052-LS+OVA, in their noses which offered protection for several months.
Researchers demonstrated that helpful T cells in the lungs, which are working against pathogens, could send signals to the body’s innate immune cells to keep them active.
Instead of trying to mimic part of a pathogen, the vaccine mimics the signals that immune cells use to communicate with each other during an infection.
Dr Pulendran thinks two doses of the nasal spray would be enough to provide protection in people and estimates that, depending on funding, the vaccine might be available within five to seven years.
Although Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at Reading University, believes the new vaccine design will be used in the future, he warns a universal vaccine is a way off.
“We are some way from a true one-jab-and-forget-it vaccine as the safety considerations are considerable given how diverse the human population is. A one size fits all may not work, and the current seasonal jabs, for flu or Covid or RSV, will remain the norm for some time yet,” he told the Independent.
Professor Jonathan Ball, virologist at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) also believes scientists are “big steps” away from a truly universal vaccine.
He said: “We have to ensure that keeping the body on 'high alert' doesn't lead to friendly fire, where a hyper-ready immune system accidentally triggers unwelcome side-effects.”
Professor of vaccinology at University of Oxford, Daniela Ferreira, found the research “exciting”.
“Over our lifetime, we’re constantly exposed to viruses and bacteria that infect the airways. As a result, most of us carry ‘memory’ immune cells, including some that live in the lining of the nose and lungs. This research shows it may be possible to use that existing immune memory as a foundation for broadly protection - even of unrelated pathogens,” she explained.

Now he’s accused of leaking state secrets to the disgraced financier from the time when his late mother had pushed for his appointment as trade envoy.
What consequences for Andrew, for the British monarchy and for institutions already rattled by Peter Mandelson’s appointment as the current prime minister’s ambassador to the United States even though he too stands accused of leaking insider information to Epstein during the financial crisis? Will the arrests restore faith or fuel cynicism?
Moreover, will the arrest of Andrew force Donald Trump’s Justice Department to come clean over what’s still unreleased… and to pursue wrongdoers in an impartial manner? Whether it’s sex trafficking, trading state secrets, or tax evasion, who is above the law and who is not?

A thousand Kenyans 'recruited' for Russia's war — new report
February 19, 2026Kenya's National Intelligence (NIS) said that 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine after allegedly being duped by the promise of employment.
The NIS findings were presented to lawmakers by parliamentary leader Kimani Ichung'wah on Wednesday.
Kenyans duped into fighting by job offers
Ichung'wah accused Russian embassy officials of colluding with recruitment agencies and human trafficking syndicates to recruit Kenyans to fight in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, under the guise of being given employment.
He said the Russian embassy officials issued them tourist visas.
"So far over 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited and departed to fight in the Russia-Ukraine war," Ichung'wah said.
Ichung'wah said that according to the NIS report, 89 Kenyans were on the front line, 39 were hospitalized, 28 were missing in action and at least one was confirmed dead.
According to the report, recruiters targeted former soldiers and police officers, as well as unemployed people, with promises that they would earn around 350,000 shillings (€ 2,300, $2,715) per month and get bonuses of up to 1.2 million shillings ($9,309).
In November, Kenya said that over 200 of its citizens were fighting for Russia, now with the NIS findings, the number is five times more than previously thought.
Moscow refutes allegations
Moscow's embassy in Nairobi denied the allegations in a statement on Thursday saying that no visas were issued to anyone intending to travel to Russia to fight in Ukraine.
The Russian embassy did however say that "the legislation of the Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”
Ukraine has previously said that hundreds of citizens from 36 African countries were fighting alongside Russian forces on its territory, with some recruited through deception.
South Africans who fought for Russia return home
On Wednesday, South Africa's Foreign Ministry announced that four South African men who had been lured into fighting for the Russian forces in Ukraine had returned home.
This follows talks held by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on the return of South Africans caught up in the war in Ukraine.
In November, Pretoria said it had received "distress calls" from 17 men who had been tricked into joining mercenary groups and were trapped in the epicenter of the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region.
South African law prohibits its citizens from fighting for a foreign army without government authorization.

US sanctions 3 RSF commanders for atrocities in Sudan
Treasury Department cites ethnic killings, torture, sexual violence during 18-month siege of El Fasher
ISTANBUL
The US Treasury Department sanctioned three commanders Thursday from Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for their roles in a brutal campaign during the paramilitary group's siege and capture of El Fasher.
"These individuals were involved in the RSF's 18-month siege of and eventual capture of El-Fasher, in which the RSF perpetrated a horrific campaign of ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence," said the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The RSF and its allied militias have committed "widespread atrocities, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide" since Sudan's civil war broke out in April 2023, it added.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the RSF to commit to an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. "We will not tolerate this ongoing campaign of terror and senseless killing in Sudan," he said, warning that without a swift end to the conflict, Sudan risks "further destabilizing the region, creating conditions for terrorist groups to grow."
The US action follows similar designations by the UK in December and the EU in January.
Sudan has been locked in a bloody conflict between the army and the RSF since April 2023, killing tens of thousands, displacing 13 million people, and creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to UN reports.
Actions by the RSF during their late-October takeover of El Fasher show “hallmarks of genocide” and indicate an ongoing risk of further atrocities, UN investigators said in a report Thursday.

Hungarian foreign minister threatens countermeasures if Ukraine does not restore Druzhba oil pipeline
Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has once again accused Ukraine of causing his country's problems related to supplies of Russian oil.
Source: Szijjarto on Facebook, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Szijjarto stated that Ukraine is "politically blackmailing" Hungary and Slovakia.
Quote: "There are no technical, engineering, or physical reasons why oil supplies through the Druzhba pipeline have not been restored. The reason is purely political. Ukrainians want us to go into elections with a petrol price of HUF 1,000 [approx. US$3.1– ed.], thereby helping the Tisza party, but we are not stupid!"
Details: Hungarian foreign minister asserted that his country "will defend itself". According to Szijjarto, supplies of oil and fuel to Hungary and Slovakia will be ensured.
"If Ukrainians continue to obstruct us, we are ready to take further joint countermeasures," he added.
Szijjarto also published joint photo with his Slovak counterpart Juraj Blanar.
Background:
- Hungary is threatening to stop exports of electricity and gas to Ukraine if Kyiv does not restore operation of the Druzhba oil pipeline.
- The official's statement came after Hungary announced suspension of diesel supplies to Ukraine.
- The transportation of Russian crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline through Ukraine has been suspended since the end of last month due to large-scale Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.
- Slovakia and Hungary have accused Ukraine of causing the halt.
- The Slovak government has also announced a halt to supplies of diesel fuel to Ukraine.

Cats could hold the key to understanding breast cancer
Scientists discovered the genetic changes that drive cancer formation in cats are similar to those seen in humans

Household cats could help us understand how breast cancer develops in humans.
That’s according to the first study of multiple cancer types in cats that has identified genetic changes that could help treat the condition in humans and animals.
Almost a quarter of all UK households own at least one cat. Cancer is one of the leading causes of illness and death in cats, however very little is known about how this develops.
Scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the Ontario Veterinary College in Canada, the University of Bern, analysed tumours from almost 500 pet cats from five countries.
They discovered the genetic changes that drive cancer formation in cats are similar to those seen in humans.
Bailey Francis, co-first author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “By comparing cancer genomics across different species, we gain a greater understanding of what causes cancer. One of our major findings was that the genetic changes in cat cancer are similar to some that are seen in humans and dogs.
“This could help experts in the veterinary field as well as those studying cancer in humans, showing that when knowledge and data flows between different disciplines, we can all benefit.”
Cats are exposed to some of the same environmental cancer risks as their owners, which means that some causes of cancer could, at least in part, be shared.
By sequencing DNA from tissue samples that had already been collected by the vet for diagnostic purposes, the study published in the journal Science, found certain genetic changes commonly found in cat cancers mirror those seen in human cancers. For example, they found similarities between feline mammary cancers and human breast cancers.
Researchers looked for around 1,000 human cancer-associated genes in both tumours and healthy tissue samples. This included 13 different types of cat cancer and allowed them to compare the genetic changes to those seen in human and dog cancers.
One cancer studied was mammary carcinomas - a common and aggressive type of cancer in cats. Researchers identified seven driver genes that led to the development of cancer when mutated.
The most common driver gene of this type of cancer was FBXW7, which is also found in 50 per cent of the cat tumours. In humans, changes in the FBXW7 gene in breast cancer tumours are associated with a worse prognosis - which is similar to what is seen in cats.
Certain chemotherapy drugs were found to be more effective in the cat mammary tumours with changes in the FBXW7 gene. Although further research is needed, these findings may mean it is possible to develop a therapy for both cats with mammary carcinoma and human breast cancer patients.
The second most common driver gene was PIK3CA, seen in 47 per cent of cat mammary carcinoma tumours. This is also a genetic change found in human breast cancer. But similarities in these driver genes were also seen across blood, bone, lung, skin, gastro-intestinal, and central nervous system tumours.
Researchers say these findings could also lead to new therapies for cancers across the two species.
Professor Geoffrey Wood, co-senior author at the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada, said: “Despite domestic cats being common pets, there was very little known about the genetics of cancer in these animals, until now.
“Our household pets share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are. This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it.”

Azerbaijan does not plan to join $7B Gaza initiative announced at Board of Peace meeting
Trump says 8 nations collectively pledged more than $7B
ISTANBUL
Azerbaijan does not plan to participate in the $7 billion in donations announced Thursday during the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington, according to presidential adviser Hikmet Hajiyev.
Hajiyev wrote on US social media platform X that Azerbaijan, as a founding member state, supports the goals and objectives of the board and may consider participating in investment projects in the Gaza Strip in the future.
“However, I would like to clarify one point. Azerbaijan doesn’t envisage to participate in the USD 7 billion financial initiative related to Gaza that was announced during the meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington,” he wrote.
US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in Gaza at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace. He said Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion.
The board was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Gaza. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
A US-backed ceasefire agreement has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year onslaught that has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, and injured over 171,000 since October 2023.
Despite the ceasefire, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

RAMALLAH/JERUSALEM, Feb 19 - A 19-year-old Palestinian-American citizen shot by an Israeli settler in the West Bank has died from his wounds,
the Palestinian Health Ministry said late on Wednesday.
A U.S. embassy official condemned the violence, telling Reuters on Thursday: "The U.S. Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizen overseas."
Nasrallah Mohammed Jamal Abu Siam was shot on Wednesday in the village of Mukhmas near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
A relative of Abu Siam, who did not wish to give his name out of fear of reprisals from Israeli security forces, said that settlers had raided the village to steal sheep.
The relative said that when villagers, including Abu Siam, had tried to prevent the theft, the settlers had begun firing at them, wounding Abu Siam and others.
The attacks injured five people, three of whom suffered bullet wounds including Abu Siam, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA said. The agency did not give details on the other injuries.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident.
Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the war in Gaza in October 2023, with nearly 700 displaced due to settler attacks in 2026 according to UN data.
Nine Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank in 2026 according to UN data, while 240 were killed in 2025. Two Israelis were killed in the West Bank during 2025, according to the data.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.
Several U.S. citizens, including the activist Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi, have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers over the past two years in the West Bank. REUTERS

Belarus, issued rare invitation to Board of Peace, says it received no visas
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 19 - Belarus, a close ally of Russia rarely invited to international gatherings, said on Thursday it had intended to attend the inaugural meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace in Washington but failed to receive the necessary visas.
Belarus has long been subject to Western sanctions over its human rights record and punitive measures were intensified after President Alexander Lukashenko allowed his country's territory to be used for Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump has made diplomatic overtures to Belarus, dropping some sanctions in exchange for the release of detainees deemed political prisoners by Western countries.
Belarusian Foreign Minister Maxim Ryzhenkov had been due to attend, his ministry said, and the U.S. side duly informed.
"However, despite carrying out all the required procedures from our side, visas were not issued to our delegation," the ministry said in a statement.
"In this situation, a valid question arises -- what kind of peace and what kind of sequence of steps are we talking about if the organisers cannot even complete basic formalities for us to take part?"
The ministry said Trump's invitation to attend the Board of Peace meeting had originally been sent to Lukashenko.
Lukashenko, in power since 1994, agreed last month to join the Board of Peace -- an invitation extended by the U.S. as part of its normalisation process involving prisoner releases.
Trump has called Lukashenko a "highly respected" leader - a description at odds with those by exiled Belarus opposition leaders, who denounce him as a dictator.
Representatives of 47 nations attended the meeting of the Board, proposed by Trump in September when he announced his plan to end Israel's war in Gaza. He later made clear the board's remit would expand to tackle other conflicts worldwide. REUTERS

US builds website that will allow Europeans to view blocked content
Unknown

The US has built a portal that will allow Europeans to view blocked content including alleged hate speech and terrorism, according to Reuters.
The portal, “freedom.gov”, will allow worldwide users to circumvent government controls on their content. The site features a graphic of a ghostly horse galloping above the Earth, and the motto: “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get ready.”
Though reports suggest the portal was developed by the state department, the domain appears to be administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The DHS also administers Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE).
It comes after the Trump administration largely gutted a state department programme called Internet Freedom, which funded grassroots groups worldwide that built technologies to circumvent censorship. Over the past decade, this programme gave more than $500m to digital rights experts – from Myanmar to Iran to Cuba to Venezuela – who built tools used by local populations to access the global internet.
Those tools allowed pictures and videos to filter out of Iran during the recent internet shutdown; they are heavily used by journalists and activists worldwide.
Freedom.gov appears to be an effort to redirect and politicise the Internet Freedom programme, according to sources.
A former US official said: “It feels mostly performative. It reads more like a combative policy declaration. USG [US government] disagreements with the EU on free speech are nothing new as a matter of policy. But a portal of this kind takes it a step further, declaring publicly that the USG is concerned with freedom of expression even among our allies in Europe.”
Internet Freedom funded tools that are open-source and privacy-preserving – technologies whose code can be audited and that do not expose their users to surveillance. These tools were not designed by US businesses, but by technologists around the world attuned to local censorship regimes.
While freedom.gov is ostensibly also an “internet freedom” project, it does not propose to preserve privacy – instead, it appears to funnel users into an opaque, central system controlled by a US government agency.
“What you’re now talking about is concentrating traffic through a US federal agency organised and kept closed – as opposed to multiple internet freedom, open-source, privacy-preserving projects,” said Andrew Ford Lyons, an independent consultant on digital security and media resilience, who worked on previous US internet freedom projects.
The “censorships” that the site purports to counter are not internet shutdowns or broad restrictions on content such as those in place in China and Iran, but European restrictions on hate speech and illegal content such as those in the Digital Services Act, or the UK’s Online Safety Act.
“When I worked with journalists in Myanmar or civil society in Afghanistan, I was helping get the right tools to the right people to do whatever they want. This is very specifically to help, like, an angry man in Schöndorf see neo-Nazi tweets from a guy in Arkansas,” said Ford Lyons.
“If the Trump administration is alleging that they’re gonna be bypassing content bans, what they’re gonna be helping users access in Europe is essentially hate speech, pornography, and child sexual abuse material,” said Nina Jankowicz, a former US official and disinformation expert.
Jankowicz added it was odd that the site appeared administered by CISA, whose remit before Trump included election infrastructure and foreign disinformation in the US. “The site is in and of itself a propaganda tool,” she said.
CISA “is the group that used to make sure secretaries of state were equipped with the tools that they needed to fight foreign disinformation. Now what we’re alleging is that our allies in Europe somehow pose a greater threat to Americans than the national security threats posed by Russia, China.”
The Trump administration and US tech companies are in an escalating tussle with the EU over the bloc’s efforts to regulate big tech companies. The European Commission has launched an investigation into X over its propagation of sexualised deepfakes; earlier this month it threatened action against Meta over an apparent breach of its antitrust rules.
Meanwhile, in December, the Trump administration barred five Europeans, including the former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, from entering the US over their work to regulate hate speech and disinformation.
This confrontation was prefigured by US vice-president, JD Vance, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference last year, in which he lambasted Europe for media censorship, content moderation and political correctness, saying that free speech was in retreat.
“This has been like a crusade of the Trump administration, even before they got into office. This free speech issue is one that they believe plays well with their base,” said Jankowicz.
“What they’re able to say is this kind of us-versus-them dichotomy: the US is defending free speech and all of these other countries that are regulating the internet.”
A state department spokesperson told Reuters the US government did not have a censorship-circumvention programme specific to Europe but added: “Digital freedom is a priority for the state department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs.”
CISA has been approached for comment.

'Remarkable' new cat cancer genome could benefit humans
February 19, 2026Cat lovers have more in common with the family feline than they may realize.
New research published in the journal Science suggests cats and humans develop similar cancers due to similar tumor-causing genetic mutations.
This finding could lead to new cancer treatments for both pets and people.
The researchers created a cat "oncogenome" — a profile of gene mutations in cats that can cause cancer — using samples from nearly 500 cats in Canada, the UK, Germany, Austria and New Zealand.
Thirteen different types of cancer found in cats were analyzed for 1,000 genes known to cause cancer in humans. The oncogenome showed:
- Half of cancer samples in cats had a mutation to the FBXW7 gene, which is associated with aggressive forms of breast cancer in humans.
- Just under half of the samples had PIK3CA mutations, which is also associated with human breast cancer.
- Tumor-protein 53 — also known as TP53 or p53 — was the most common mutation in cats, and is often implicated as a driver of many human cancers.
A better model for cancer treatment?
While lab rodents have long been used to study cancers and potential drugs, cats could provide a more suitable model for scientific research.
"Here, you've got a model of spontaneously developing tumors, just as spontaneously as occurs in a human," said Louise van der Weyden, the study's senior researcher, based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in the UK.
"These pets — cats and dogs — are in the same environment that we're in, so they've got the same pollution […] something that you’re not going to get in the laboratory."
By using a large number of non-pedigree housecats, the researchers had a genetically diverse pool in which to search for gene mutations common in cats and humans.
Van der Weyden said the pool could be expanded to include cats from other countries to offer an even broader understanding of cancer causes shared by felines and humans.
Of greatest interest is the potential for this cat oncogenome project to help identify environmental risks within the home. If, for instance, a certain genetic change triggers mammary cancer in the family cat, it could indicate similar risks for humans in the same house.
"There's a lot of studies now that are starting to think of cats and dogs as sentinels for the environment — the canary in the coal mine — because they are in the exact same environment that we are in," said van der Weyden. "We saw UV mutations [in cats] that were exactly the same as in humans, for example."
What is next for the oncogenome?
Trialing potential cancer therapies on cats with potential benefits for humans was shown in 2025 in the US by a group at the University of California.
The team led by Daniel Johnson and Jennifer Grandis tested a drug used to treat squamous cell carcinomas in humans on a group of cats with an oral form of the disease. Around a third of the treated cats lived an extra half year on average.
Though they weren't involved in the new oncogenome research, the UC team welcomed its findings.
"This is truly an exciting paper that further supports the relevance to humans, as well as pets, of studies like ours," Johnson and Grandis wrote in an email to DW.
"It is remarkable that alterations in genes such as p53 are found in high prevalence in both humans and cats. We can now begin to use studies like this to develop personalized cancer therapies for both cats and humans."
Van der Weyden hopes that her group can continue exploring cancers in pets to benefit both animals and humans. Because animal harm is minimized by using "real world" rather than lab animals, with support of animal owners, unnecessary animal harm could also be avoided, she said.
"Most [pet owners] will sign a form to say they're happy for [biopsy samples] to be used for research purposes, which I think is really open-minded and really wonderful," van der Weyden said. "It would be wonderful if something could come out of it. I think it’s wonderful to acknowledge all the owners that do that because without it, we couldn’t do this kind of study."

Full list of 11 Australian women with ISIS links trying to leave Syria revealed
The ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women connected to former Islamic State fighters in Syria who attempted to journey home to Australia this week
The group of 34 Australians, including 23 children, has been living in camps in Syria since the fall of the so-called caliphate, and some of those children were actually born behind the razor wire.
Some of the women are believed to have accompanied their husbands to the war zone, but others came with family and married IS fighters once they arrived. Some say they got stuck in Syria by accident.
Many of them have previously spoken to the ABC.
They left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday in the hopes of returning to Australia, but were forced to turn back shortly afterwards.
An official at the Al Roj camp said that when the group left, staff started dismantling their tents, and when the group unexpectedly returned, some had to bunk in together.
On Wednesday, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke revealed one of the women is now the subject of a Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO), potentially banning her from travelling to Australia for up to two years on national security grounds.
It is not clear who the woman subject to the TEO is.
But the ABC can reveal the names of the 11 women who tried to leave after obtaining a handwritten list from inside the camp.
Nesrine Zahab
Nesrine Zahab is now in her early 30s, but she came to Syria from Sydney in her early 20s.
She has previously claimed she did not realise she was entering Syria.
"Who walks into a war zone?" she told Four Corners in 2019.
Nesrine said she had been on a family holiday in Lebanon, when she and a female cousin snuck away to deliver aid to refugees on the Turkish side of the Syrian border.
She said someone then asked for her passport.
"That kind of freaked me out," she said.
She said she only realised she was in Syria when she saw an Islamic State (IS) flag.
"I found that I was in Syria. Did I have a heart attack? Of course I had a heart attack," she told reporter Dylan Welch.
"Did I cry and scream and chuck a fit like a little girl? I chucked the biggest tantrum.
"Did it work? No. I'm still here."
She later married an Australian-born IS fighter named Ahmed Merhi, who was later captured and sentenced to death.
She said she believed marrying offered her the best chance of survival.
Sumaya Zahab
Sumaya Zahab is in her early 30s.
She is the sister of Muhammad Zahab, a former Sydney maths teacher who joined IS.
He died in an air strike in 2018, but was known to have convinced several family members to travel to Syria.
Aminah Zahab
Aminah Zahab is the mother of Muhammad Zahab and Sumaya Zahab, and the aunt of Nesrine Zahab.
She would now be about 50 years old and had followed her son to Syria.
"We're clueless parents. We had a lot of trust in our children, a lot of trust," she told Four Corners in 2019 from the Al-Hol camp.
"We didn't know how to do much things in life. As we raised our children, and we just let the children rule our lives.
"I feel very angry. I feel very devastated. I feel sore, pain."
Aminah was clearly distressed when she spoke about the conditions in the camp at the time.
"Tents have been burning down, and they're right next to each other," she said.
"You don't understand, you see charcoaled women and children."
Zeinab Ahmed
Zeinab Ahmed is the second-eldest daughter of Mohammed and Kawsar Abbas.
She last spoke to the ABC from Al Roj in early 2025, as she made an impassioned plea to the Australian government to help get the group home.
She feared for her safety, and the lives of her children.
At the time, she revealed that Australian officials had travelled to the camp in 2022 to meet with the women and children.
Health checks and DNA tests were conducted.
Months later, four families were repatriated to Australia.
"They took the first group and we were so happy that some of us were getting out, some of our kids will be saved," Zeinab said.
"Once they took them in there was backlash, there was backlash from when the announcement was made and then they never came back."
The process undertaken by officials in 2022 likely paved the way for travel documents to be issued for the group of women ahead of their failed attempt to leave Al Roj earlier this week.
In recent days, the Australian government has repeatedly denied offering support to the group to make the journey home — with the exception of what they are legally obligated to do.
This would include issuing travel documents.
Al Roj officials have told the ABC that the group have been issued with single-entry passports.
Kirsty Rosse-Emile
The ABC also spoke to Kirsty Rosse-Emile in early 2025 in the Al Roj camp.
"Hello, I'm here. Can you just come and get me, finally, and my children and all the other Australians here?" she said in a message to the Australian government.
"We're ready to start our lives afresh."
She spoke of her desire to see her mother and take her kids to the beach, and conceded that detailing how she ended up in Syria "might make problems for me."
In 2020, The Guardian reported that Kirsty's husband, Moroccan-born Nabil Kadmiry, had his Australian citizenship stripped from him by the federal government.
Janai Safar
Janai Safar was among the women whom Four Corners met in the Al-Hol camp in 2019.
She mentioned at the time that the group were aware of new legislation which could prevent them from returning to Australia.
"We've heard about the laws being passed, TEOs and stuff," Janai told the program.
A TEO has been imposed on one of the 11 women in the group — but exactly who remains unclear.
Her grandfather, John Crockett, told the ABC at the time that it was better they return to Australia than languish in camps in Syria.
"If some of them are going to go to jail when they come home, it's far better for them to be in prison back here and do a term of whatever they've been convicted of," he told Four Corners.
"At least if they come back here and they're jailed, at least we'll be able to go and see them."
Kawsar Abbas
Kawsar Abbas, from Melbourne, is in her early 50s.
She's the wife of Mohammed Ahmad, who ran a charity to support the people of Syria.
The Australian Federal police suspected the charity of funnelling cash to Islamic State.
In 2019, Mohammed Ahmad told the ABC that he and his family got trapped in Syria after travelling from the charity's headquarters in Turkey to attend the wedding of his son, Omar.
Mohammed said soon after arriving in Syria, he realised Omar had sworn allegiance to Islamic State. Omar also kept a Yazidi slave, who Ahmad said was treated well.
Ahmad implied that he did not approve of his son keeping the woman, but said he did not raise his concerns as other fathers in the caliphate had been killed for standing up to their children.
Mohammedinsisted he was never an Islamic State supporter, but he was imprisoned in north-eastern Syria when IS was defeated.
Zahra Ahmad
Zahra Ahmad is the eldest daughter of Mohammed and Kawsar Abbas.
She's in her early 30s.
According to her father, the family got trapped in Syria in 2014 when they came for a wedding.
But the circumstances of how Zahra's family came to be in Syria are contested, SBS reported in 2024.
The outlet wrote that when some male members of her family joined the IS group, Zahra said the women had no choice but to follow.
"I didn't make this bed," she told SBS.
"We are now forced to suffer for the decisions that other people — other male influencers — have made on our behalf, and now they're all gone, and we are left to suffer with our kids."
Zahra later married notorious Islamic State recruiter Muhammad Zahab, who died in an air strike.
Hodan Abby
The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age revealed details of Hodan Abby's case in 2021, through an emotional appeal from her father.
Hodan had left her western Sydney home and fled to Syria in 2015 when she was still a teenager, the newspapers reported, in a bid to become a jihadi bride.
She gave birth to a daughter in Syria, and the child later suffered shrapnel wounds to her head.
Doctors told her surgery was required outside of the camp.
Hodan's father said he feared for his daughter and granddaughter and urged the government to intervene.
The newspapers reported at the time that Hodan had agreed to be placed under a Terrorism Control Order if she returned to Australia, giving law enforcement and intelligence agencies the power to monitor her.
Kawsar Kanj and Hyam Raad
There are two more Australian women on the list: Kawsar Kanj and Hyam Raad.
Little to no public information is available about them.
Another woman with the same surname, Mariam Raad, returned in 2022.
She was convicted of travelling to a proscribed area in 2024.

Tucker Carlson's 'detention' claim unravels as new footage surfaces

The uproar surrounding the brief visit of conservative American media personality Tucker Carlson to Israel continues, after new footage released Thursday cast doubt on his claim that he was "detained" and "dragged into an interrogation room" at Ben-Gurion Airport.
Carlson told the Daily Mail that after concluding an interview with US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee in Jerusalem, Israeli security officials confiscated his passport and led his producer into a side room to question him about the content of their discussion.

However, footage first shared by social media activist Oli London shows Carlson at the VIP terminal at Ben-Gurion Airport, smiling, conversing with employees and even taking a photo with one of them, contradicting his narrative of being forcibly escorted and having his passport seized. In a post accompanying the video, London wrote that Carlson had been "exposed" and was neither arrested nor interrogated, but treated like any other visitor.
The US Embassy in Jerusalem rejected Carlson's claims on Wednesday, stating that he "received the same treatment as any visitor to Israel." The embassy said its only involvement was coordinating the landing of his private plane to help ensure a smooth visit.
An embassy spokesperson also clarified that it was inaccurate to suggest Israel had intended to allow Carlson into the country solely for the purpose of conducting the interview. According to the spokesperson, Carlson himself chose to remain in Israel for only a few hours before departing, a personal decision that was not imposed on him at any stage. The Israel Airports Authority likewise emphasized that there had been no unusual delay or interrogation.
Meanwhile, conservative commentator Laura Loomer alleged that the initial report of Carlson's "detention" had been planted. She claimed that Daily Mail reporter Philip Nieto had previously worked with Carlson and published a false story that Carlson himself had fed him, including an assertion that the White House had asked Carlson to confront Huckabee ahead of the US midterm elections. Loomer stressed that "the White House did not ask Carlson for anything" and described the episode as unethical conduct.
Ambassador Huckabee also weighed in online, stating that "everyone entering and leaving Israel is asked routine security questions." He noted that he too undergoes similar checks, despite holding a diplomatic passport and visa, and emphasized that passport inspections and security questioning are standard practice in every country.
The newly surfaced footage, together with the official denials and allegations that the story was deliberately planted, has placed Carlson at the center of criticism not only from Israeli officials but also from within segments of the American conservative camp.

LPG tanker explosion kills four, injures 17 in northern Santiago

ALBAWABA- At least four people were killed and 17 others injured after a tanker truck carrying liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) overturned and exploded in northern Santiago early Thursday, authorities said.
The incident occurred at the intersection of Ruta 5 Norte and General Velásquez in the Renca district, a major industrial and highway corridor in the Chilean capital.
According to Carabineros police chief Víctor Vielma, the tanker, operated by Gasco, lost control for reasons still under investigation, struck a guardrail, and overturned before igniting in a massive fireball. Thick white smoke billowed across the area as flames spread to nearby vehicles and structures.
Seven smaller vehicles were damaged in the blast, along with parts of a nearby vehicle scrapyard. Sections of the Autopista Central were closed as firefighters worked for hours to contain the blaze amid concerns about possible secondary explosions from residual gas.
The truck driver, an employee of Gasco, was among those killed. Most of the other victims were motorists caught in the chain-reaction crash. Authorities said 10 of the injured suffered severe burns or traumatic injuries and were hospitalized in critical condition.
In a statement, Gasco expressed condolences to the victims’ families and confirmed the tanker had been traveling from a terminal in Quintero to the company’s Maipú plant.
The company said it would fully cooperate with the investigation being led by the Carabineros’ SIAT traffic investigation unit and the LABOCAR forensic team.
While the exact cause remains unclear, preliminary hypotheses include a possible valve leak that may have ignited on impact. Investigators are also examining whether speed, mechanical failure, or driver error played a role.

Unidentified drone flew over Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office – UP
A new wave of attacks on anti-corruption bodies has begun a few weeks ago and recently at night an unidentified drone has been spotted over territory of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO).
Source: Ukrainska Pravda article
Quote: "According to sources in one of law enforcement agencies, recently at night a drone was spotted over territory of the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office. Police were called to the scene. Affiliation of UAV is currently being established."
Details: Last week, during a public report on the work, Semen Kryvonos, head of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), said that attempts to pressure agencies do not stop. As an example, he cited a recent case when a listening device was found in the apartment of the head of a group of detectives working on uncovering crimes in the defence sector. Anti-corruption officials are not disclosing the circumstances but the publication notes that such an operation could hardly have been carried out without help of special services.
All these events are taking place at a time when a new wave of negativity about the agencies has appeared in Telegram channels. A similar campaign was already observed in summer 2025 before the attempt to take away independence of anti-corruption bodies.
Then, as well as now, NABU and SAPO have been accused of corruption and inefficiency. For the period of 12-26 January 2026, 238 publications with negative sentiment were recorded on social media. The vast majority of negative mentions came from anonymous or semi-anonymous resources, which may indicate managed information influence.
Anti-corruption bodies, in turn, insist that attempts of any influence will not slow down their work. All the more so because, for example, the Midas case has moved into other jurisdictions that are ready to cooperate and are already working with Ukrainian investigation.

Even Fox News hosts struggling to make sense of RFK Jr’s and Kid Rock’s workout video
‘Listen, somebody needs to tell RFK Jr. it’s okay to wear shorts. I mean, bro, don’t be upset about your legs,’ Fox News military analyst Johnny Jones said
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Why did Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and aging rap-rocker Kid Rock release a sweaty, shirtless workout collab video? Not even Fox News is sure.
During an episode of The Five on Wednesday, the panel members were left scratching their heads during a discussion of the bizarre video.
In a clip posted to X, Kennedy and Kid Rock, both shirtless, take turns riding on a stationary bike and doing pushups in what looks like a sauna. At one point, Kid Rock flips the middle finger to the camera. A title screen, inexplicably featuring a great white shark, tells us this is Kennedy and Kid Rock's "Rock Out Work Out."
The video is apparently intended to promote the DHHS secretary's Make America Healthy Again agenda.
Fox News' Greg Gutfeld watched the video and asked his co-panelists, "This raises a question: who rubs off on who?"
“You would think, ‘Oh, my God. RFK Jr is hanging out with Kid Rock. Oh, poor RFK Jr. is going to end up drinking. He’s going to be drinking again. He’s going to be womanizing again.’ And then what happens? You see Kid Rock at the gym," Gutfeld said. "He’s like, you know, working out and cold plunge—it’s like RFK was a bad influence on Kid Rock. Who would have seen that coming?”
Fox News military analyst Johnny Jones pointed out that the DHHS secretary wore blue jeans throughout his entire workout.
“Listen, somebody needs to tell RFK Jr. it’s okay to wear shorts. I mean, bro, don’t be upset about your legs. I don’t care what they look like. Take it from me, nobody needs impressive legs. You look great with your shirt off. Throw the shorts on so we don’t all go, ‘Wow, that’s weird.’”
Emily Compagno jumped on the “no jeans” bandwagon with Jones.
“My pet peeve was jeans at the beach in California. Now it might be jeans at the gym,” she said.
Even with the minor critiques, The Five is still a Fox News product, so it wasn't long before the hosts found a way to praise the video.
“I’m obviously not the audience for this video, but I like the idea of people eating healthier,” Dana Perino said. “I think that is great, and the access to it is wonderful. So the more people that learn about it, the better. I’m all for that.”
In January, Kennedy introduced an inverted food pyramid, which now places nutrient-dense proteins, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables at the top, and grains at the bottom.
“These Guidelines return us to the basics,” Kennedy said in a statement at the time. “American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods—protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats, and whole grains—and dramatically reduce highly processed foods. This is how we Make America Healthy Again.”
Harold Ford Jr split the difference, noting that he "doesn't get into cold plunges with guys" — referencing a moment when Kennedy and Kid Rock share glasses of whole milk while lounging in a pool together — but said he was otherwise "impressed by the video."
"I’m a Kid Rock fan. I love his music, but to the substance for one moment, I think what Secretary Kennedy is doing around food is really, really important,” he said.
He also offered an under-the-radar critique of Kennedy that may have been the sharpest to come out of the discussion.
“It’s an issue I think [Kennedy] knows, and knows more so than some of the professional medical and scientific, other things that he talks about,” Ford Jr said.

The Guardian view on the royals and the law: no more managed disgrace | Editorial
Unknown

04:06:25 KST

The arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor the king’s brother, should be the moment deference ends and accountability begins – a correction long overdue. For more than 15 years, allegations surrounding Mr Mountbatten-Windsor were managed away by silence, an out-of-court settlement and his withdrawal from royal duties. In short, his behaviour was viewed as an image problem to be handled privately. That era now looks to be over.
That the eighth in line to the throne was sitting in a police cell on his 66th birthday shows how far he has fallen. The formal investigation means that the question is no longer about protecting the monarchy but one of what happened, and who might be responsible for unlawful acts. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s descent into ignominy has unfolded slowly but inexorably. His stupidity and arrogance led him to believe that he could talk his way out of his relationship with the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Instead, he faces a legal and constitutional reckoning.
Thames Valley police arrested the royal on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following a complaint by the anti-monarchy group Republic. The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Within the 3m files and messages released by the US Department of Justice are emails that appear to show Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forwarding documents and commercial information to Epstein while serving as trade envoy. The king’s brother denies any wrongdoing.
A single 2001 photograph plunged the monarchy into crisis. It showed the then Prince Andrew with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and lent credibility to her trafficking allegations. The visual evidence made it hard to dismiss her statements as implausible. Though he denied knowing her and rejected the claims, a £12m settlement followed and the image shaped a scandal that shook the House of Windsor. More women have come forward alleging abuse, which Mr Mountbatten-Windsor denies.
Ms Giuffre died by suicide last year. Her family said that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest shows that “no one is above the law”. MPs should not bend the knee before inheritance and rank. As this column has long argued, it cannot be right to call for the king’s brother to give evidence to US lawmakers, but not to parliament. Liam Byrne, the Labour chair of the cross-party business and trade committee, was correct, in a constitutional sense, that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor could be questioned by MPs. His public office as trade envoy answers to parliament. It is not the law, but convention – including Commons rules barring “reflections” on the royals – which restrains politics.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is still a counsellor of state, theoretically able to stand in for the king. He will never wear the crown. Parliament should now debate whether hereditary privilege can coexist with democratic accountability.
Symbolically, this episode surely marks the end of the assumption that being part of the royal household is a badge of impunity. Practically, it should deliver more victim-centred accountability. The story of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s Epstein connections is only beginning. If there are no charges, it becomes a story about institutional reform. If prosecution proceeds, he will answer to 12 jurors who will judge him by the evidence, not by his birth. Either way, the old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished.

Zelenskyy schedules meeting with negotiating group on further steps for Friday
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy scheduled a special meeting with the participants of the negotiating group on further steps and decisions for Friday, February 20.
"Today, all participants of our negotiating group will be in Ukraine. And for tomorrow I scheduled a special meeting with them on our further steps, our decisions. There will be a report here, in Kyiv, on those aspects of the negotiations that should not be discussed on the phone," Zelenskyy said in an evening address on Thursday.
In addition, the participants of the meeting will determine the further framework for the conversation with partners, with the European, U.S. and Russian sides.
As reported, on February 17 and 18, the Ukrainian delegation held negotiations on a peaceful settlement in the trilateral Ukraine-U.S.-Russia format in Geneva.

UK may not allow US to use its bases to attack Iran over possible int'l law violations - report

04:05:32 KST

The United Kingdom has yet to allow the United States to use its bases in the region to attack Iran, The Sunday Times reported on Thursday.
The hesitation reportedly follows concerns of possible international law violations, which “makes no distinction between a state carrying out the attack and those in support if the latter have 'knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act.’”
According to a Wednesday Truth Social post by US President Donald Trump, the US may need to use the joint UK-US Diego Garcia military base and the Royal Air Force (RAF) Station base Fairford in Gloucestershire “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham sharply criticized the UK after the Time’s report, saying that if it is true, it would be an "astonishing" move that would raise “serious questions” about the status of Diego Garcia.
Graham argued that Iran, which he labeled as "the largest state sponsor of terrorism," is currently at its weakest point in years, due to internal mass protests and the "devastating blows" dealt by the US and Israel to the regime's military infrastructure.
He warned Britain that if it chooses to "sit on the sidelines," it will find itself "on the wrong side of history," and claimed this is yet another example of the erosion of US alliances in Europe.
Trump revokes support for Chagos Islands deal
The Times said that Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke on Tuesday night regarding Iran, and on Wednesday, Trump withdrew his support for Starmer’s deal to give the Chagos Islands, which include Diego Garcia, to Mauritius.
Britain and Mauritius last year struck a deal to transfer sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while allowing Britain to retain control of the air base under a long-term lease.
“Prime Minister Starmer should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia, by entering a tenuous, at best, 100 Year Lease,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “This land should not be taken away from the UK and, if it is allowed to be, it will be a blight on our Great Ally.”
“We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the UK, but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.”
Trump had previously called the deal “an act of total weakness” and "another in a very long line of national security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired."
Reuters contributed to this report.

High Court urged to lift Oct. 7 audit freeze, hold semi-classified hearing
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-19
19:05:21 UTC
04:05:21 KST

State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman on Thursday filed a 163-page sworn response with the High Court of Justice, urging it to reject two petitions that prompted the court late last year to freeze a set of central audits into the failures surrounding the October 7 attack and the ensuing war.
Englman asked the justices to convene an urgent hearing whose first segment would be held behind closed doors so that he could personally present draft findings, including material classified at the level of “top secret.”
In the filing, submitted on Thursday in response to a conditional order issued by the court on December 31, 2025, the Comptroller’s Office also asked that the three-justice panel currently hearing the petitions be expanded, arguing that the issues raised now require a constitutional interpretation of Basic Law: The State Comptroller that goes to the heart of the institution’s authority and its ability to independently audit the political, military, and civilian echelons of government.
In response, the Prime Minister’s Office said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had published cabinet protocols under his authority in order to expose the truth to the public after the High Court halted the comptroller’s review. “The only way to expose the full truth is through an equitable and independent commission of inquiry that will represent the entire public and before which all materials will be presented,” the statement said.
The December ruling did not permanently bar the comptroller from auditing the events of October 7 but temporarily froze work on eight defined “core” audits while the court considers whether reviews that touch on matters of national security decision-making, wartime policy, and potential personal responsibility at senior levels fall within his statutory remit or should instead be reserved for a future state commission of inquiry.
Those petitions, filed by the Military Defense Counsel on behalf of IDF personnel and by the Movement for Quality Government, argued that audits dealing with policy and strategy or requiring broad investigative fact-finding risk exceeding the comptroller’s mandate and may undermine the procedural rights of individuals whose actions are being scrutinized.
The court’s interim injunction followed, ordering Englman to explain why he should not refrain from examining such issues in the context of October 7 and the war.
In his sworn response, Englman rejects the premise that the audits seek to evaluate the substance of national policy itself, arguing instead that they examine the processes by which decisions were made and implemented and the systemic gaps between established standards and operational reality.
Reviews of decision-making frameworks, intelligence coordination, and implementation failures, he contends, fall squarely within the traditional domain of state audit and are consistent with international standards governing supreme audit institutions.
The right to cross-examine witnesses
He further disputes a key demand raised in the petitions that audits touching on possible individual responsibility adopt the procedural framework used by state commissions of inquiry, including the right to cross-examine witnesses. According to the filing, the legislature’s selective incorporation of certain inquiry-type powers into the State Comptroller Law creates a negative arrangement that precludes importing the full procedural regime applicable to commissions into audit proceedings.
A central institutional concern raised in the response is that narrowing the comptroller’s authority to exclude issues labeled “policy” or “strategy” would create what the filing terms “immunity zones” in precisely the areas where failures on October 7 are alleged to have occurred, allowing strategic-level decision-making by senior political and military officials to evade independent oversight while leaving only tactical questions subject to review.
The Comptroller’s Office argues that such an outcome would create a structural gap in parliamentary supervision of the executive branch and risk long-term harm to the system of checks and balances.
The filing also asserts that the harm is already materializing on the ground.
Since the issuance of the conditional order and interim injunction at the end of 2025, the office says, some officials and agencies have cited the pending litigation as grounds to delay meetings or withhold documents even on matters not covered by the freeze, exposing the public to partial accounts of the audit process through media disclosures rather than the finalized reports themselves.
According to materials submitted alongside the response, the frozen audits address decision-making processes and preparedness at the political, intelligence, and military levels in the years leading up to October 7. This includes the functioning of the security cabinet, coordination between the political echelon and the intelligence community, defensive readiness along the Gaza border, and the formulation and implementation of understandings with Hamas from April 2018 until the outbreak of hostilities.
Other topics under review include wartime stockpiling targets for ammunition and the use of economic tools against terrorist organizations.
A table attached to the filing details meetings held between audit teams and senior officials across 2025 and early 2026, including with Netanyahu, former defense minister Yoav Gallant, former IDF chief of staff Herzi Halevi, and former Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar, where prewar intelligence processes, border defense doctrine, and the events of October 7 were discussed as part of the ongoing audits.
In requesting that the court hold the initial portion of the next hearing in camera, Englman argues that the publication of preliminary findings is legally barred unless expressly authorized by the comptroller, and that at least two draft reports – dealing with the defense of cities and aspects of the Nova festival attack near Re’im – contain material classified at the highest level.
The motion proposes that only representatives of the Attorney-General’s Office with appropriate security clearance be permitted to attend the confidential segment, given that the draft findings may touch on third parties not represented in the proceedings.
Englman also pushes back against claims that the existence of the audits conflicts with the potential establishment of a state commission of inquiry into October 7, maintaining that the legislature envisioned the two mechanisms as complementary rather than mutually exclusive and noting that past commissions have relied extensively on comptroller reports in carrying out their mandates.
The filing comes against the backdrop of a broader debate over accountability for the failures of October 7 and the still-unresolved question of whether and when a full state commission of inquiry will be formed.
Englman is asking the High Court to dismiss the petitions, lift the interim injunction freezing the eight audits, and schedule an expedited hearing to allow the audit process – which his office says has already consumed more than 300 person-years of work across multiple reviews – to proceed without further delay.

Bronze scale pan found in ancient Sussiya reveals how biblical law shaped daily Jewish life

A rare bronze scale pan was discovered during excavations in the ancient Jewish town of Sussiya by a father and daughter participating in an educational dig, the Mount Hebron Regional Council announced on Thursday.
The dig was conducted by schools from the area, in cooperation with the Civil Administration’s Staff Officer for Archaeology in the West Bank and the Mount Hebron Regional Council.
Neta, a second-grader at Sussiya's regional school, and her father, Nachshon, discovered the pan inside a residential building near the town’s main street.
According to the statement, the bronze pan was part of a set of portable hanging scales common in ancient Israel, which included two small bowls with tiny holes along their rims suspended across a balance.
The find will undergo a formal conservation process and is expected to be displayed to the public in the future.
'Project is invaluable'
“Finding a scale pan in the heart of an ancient Jewish settlement is like finding a book of ethics buried in the ground,” Dr. Achiya Cohen-Tavor, archaeologist and director of the excavation, said, adding that the discovery “illustrates how the residents of Sussiya put the biblical commandment of 'Just balances, just weights shall you have’ [Leviticus 19] into practice.”
“In a world where every human action was understood as capable of tipping the scales of the entire world between merit and debt, this physical find is testimony to a life of social and spiritual responsibility."
Eliram Azulay, head of the Mount Hebron Regional Council, affirmed the importance of the communal and educational digs, as they allow the “younger generation to take an active part in uncovering our heritage and connecting to our roots.”
“It's an amazing project that connects children to heritage, culture, and the land,” Nachshon added, echoing Azulay’s words. “It's uplifting to see young children digging with such professionalism and according to careful, delicate excavation protocols. The project is invaluable.”

The Guardian view on Merz and Meloni: an emerging Berlin-Rome axis is threatening the EU’s green deal
Unknown

When the European Union launched its green deal in 2019, putting into law the goal of climate neutrality by the middle of the century, it showed strategic foresight as well as global leadership. Russia’s war in Ukraine has starkly underlined the extent to which the continent’s energy security – and its future prosperity – is dependent on the transition away from fossil fuels. Lately, however, EU leaders’ environmental approach appears to be echoing the youthful St Augustine’s plea on chastity: make us greener, but not yet.
The recent European Industry Summit in Antwerp made unusually big headlines thanks to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s xenophobic outburst over immigration. But it was also notable for fierce attacks on one of the most important pillars of EU environmental policy. The bloc’s emissions trading system (ETS) – which makes polluters pay for the C02 they emit – has achieved dramatic results in driving down overall emissions since 2005 and encouraging green innovation. Worryingly, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, appeared to sympathise with demands from Sir Jim and other CEOs for a radical relaxation of the rules.
There will be much more of this to come. Together with the far-right Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, Mr Merz is championing a deregulatory approach to delivering growth that risks hobbling Europe’s climate ambitions. Ms Meloni has long railed at what she has described as “green follies” imposed by Brussels. In Mr Merz, an economic liberal instinctively hostile to regulation, she has acquired a powerful ally.
The Berlin-Rome axis has already succeeded in diluting plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. EU leaders have also voted to scale back overall 2040 targets for greenhouse gas reduction. Corporate sustainability reporting rules have been watered down. Italo-German calls for greater flexibility in achieving decarbonising goals, and attacks on regulatory systems such as the ETS, have the potential to license a full-scale pivot away from net zero targets.
This is disastrously shortsighted from an economic as well as an environmental point of view. When the green deal was launched, it was rightly seen as a means to encourage the changes needed to make economies competitive in a fossil-fuel-free era. Competition from China has underlined the importance of moving faster in this direction. Instead, the rising influence of rightwing populism across the continent is leading to a new go-slow consensus.
As the former head of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi has argued, the true path to future competitiveness lies in sustained investment, partly financed by common EU borrowing, and incorporating a bold green industrial strategy. Mr Merz is right to suggest that, in some areas, a simplification of bureaucratic hurdles could be beneficial for growth. But a blind faith in deregulation, and capitulation to corporate lobbying on environmental rules by the likes of Sir Jim, is not a remotely adequate strategy for the times, ethically or economically.
Given Donald Trump’s ongoing determination to undermine international attempts to combat global heating, Europe’s role as a climate leader is more vital than ever. So too is the need to develop an industrial vision that ensures the continent’s prosperity and security in the long term. As Mr Merz and Ms Meloni manoeuvre, it is time for defenders of the EU’s green deal to stand up and be counted.

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad receives Courage Award on behalf of Iranian protesters

Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad accepted the Courage Award on Wednesday at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on behalf of Iranian protesters, many of whom have lost their lives this past month, demonstrating against the Islamic regime.
Demonstrations broke out across Iran in response to the country’s economic crisis and the rapid devaluation of the rial. As authorities began a brutal crackdown, murdering thousands of protesters and enacting a country-wide internet blackout, civilians spoke out in support of regime change.
Alinejad collected the award in front of a coalition of more than 30 human rights organizations.
The Courage Award was presented to the Heroes of Iran by Swedish Member of the European Parliament Alice Teodorescu Måwe, who said, “History will remember those who excused the brutality and those who closed their ears to the Iranian tiger’s abyssal roar. But history will also remember those who stood up – when it was dangerous, lonely, and therefore essential.”
“I do not accept this award as a personal honor. I accept it as a platform to indict the Islamic Republic for its massacre. The real courage belongs to the Iranian women and men who carry bullets in their bodies and still demand freedom,” Alinejad said.
“While diplomats of the Islamic Republic, including its foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, walk freely through the halls of the United Nations in Geneva, more than 40,000 innocent Iranians have been massacred at home.
“The same regime that blinded protesters, stormed hospitals, executed children, and sent assassins abroad is still granted the privilege of diplomacy. What a historical shame. Geneva cannot be a safe haven for representatives of a regime that behaves like ISIS.”
Recognizing victims maimed by the IRGC, she asserted, “The world cannot normalize a regime that shoots women and men in the eyes, executes protesters, and sends assassins across borders storming into hospitals, finishing off the injured, and hanging the protesters,” and demanded international intervention.
Iran must be deprived of seats at the UN, Alinejad said
The activist insisted that Tehran be deprived of seats at the UN and other institutions, and its officials exiled, sanctioned, and prosecuted for their roles in the regime’s crimes and international accountability. While Alinejad now lives in New York City, the Islamic regime has targeted her for her condemnations of the widespread human rights violations.
She has faced multiple kidnappings and assassination plots and now lives under FBI protection.
“We chose the heroes of Iran for this award because they have done what the United Nations has failed to do: they have looked the regime in the eye and refused to blink,” said Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, a co-organizer of the summit. “For nearly 50 years, this tyranny has relied on fear to survive. These heroes are proving that the fear is gone, and the regime is terrified.”
“While the world’s diplomats shake hands with the butchers of Tehran, we are honoring their victims. This award is our message to the people of Iran: You are not alone. When your government cuts the internet to kill in the dark, we will be your voice. We will ensure the world cannot look away,” he concluded.

Brazil court reinstates order to free up access to Cargill's Santarem port terminal
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
SAO PAULO, Feb 19 - A Brazilian court reinstated late on Wednesday an order to free up access to the Santarem river port terminal where U.S. grain trader Cargill operates, according to a ruling signed by federal judge Shamyl Cipriano and seen by Reuters.
Indigenous protesters have been blocking truck traffic at the entrance of Cargill's Santarem terminal in northern Brazil for several days, protesting against plans to dredge the Tapajos river and move even more grains like soy and corn destined for export markets.
Last Friday, a federal court issued a decision obligating the government to adopt measures in 48 hours to remove protesters and restore access to Cargill's facility in Para state.
Federal prosecutors told Reuters they appealed that decision, arguing the ruling ignored norms of the National Council of Justice, which requires the direct participation of indigenous peoples and the holding of mediation hearings before any removal.
That led to the ruling being overturned on Sunday, prosecutors said, before Wednesday's reinstatement offered a win for Cargill.
The prosecutors are analyzing the latest court decision.
Amport, which represents port terminal operators in the Amazon basin, welcomed the latest ruling as "it recognizes the essential nature of port infrastructure and ... the harm resulting from a prolonged shutdown."
On Thursday, local media reported indigenous people "intercepted" barges in operation for Cargill in the Santarem area while they were crossing the Tapajos river.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor on US law enforcement radar 15 years before UK arrest

While Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest by British police on Thursday came after years of uproar over his association with Jeffrey Epstein, documents show he had been on the radar of US law enforcement for nearly 15 years.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s name came up during a 2011 FBI inquiry into Epstein, investigative documents recently disclosed by the justice department reveal. Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all allegations of misconduct related to Epstein.
In March of that year, agents traveled to Australia after an Epstein victim contacted federal prosecutors in south Florida, saying she had “information pertinent” to the late financier and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The victim’s name is redacted from several documents chronicling the interview, but details closely track the public and legal claims made by Virginia Giuffre, a well-known Epstein accuser who died by suicide last year.
Giuffre said Epstein abused her and that he and Maxwell trafficked her to other men, including Mountbatten-Windsor.
During the FBI interview, the woman said that she was a locker-room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. Maxwell saw her reading a book on massage or anatomy and said she was seeking a traveling masseuse, the woman told investigators.
She told FBI agents she traveled with Maxwell and Epstein to London and that they went to a nightclub with Mountbatten-Windsor and alleged that she and the then-royal engaged in sexual activity at Maxwell’s home. She also alleged that there was sexual activity at Epstein’s Manhattan home, according to the FBI document.
Andrew has repeatedly denied engaging in sexual activity with Giuffre. During his Newsnight interview in November 2019, Andrew insisted he had been elsewhere during this alleged incident, saying: “I was with the children, and I’d taken Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at, I suppose, four or five in the afternoon. And then because the duchess [Sarah Ferguson] was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other is there.”
The document does not appear to be online any longer, at least as initially indexed, but the Guardian downloaded the file and its URL is in the Internet Archive. Another document that appears near-verbatim to this one, but with accused men’s names redacted, appears in public records request filings that remain online.
Following Epstein’s arrest, Mountbatten-Windsor appeared to feature more prominently in law enforcement’s inquiries into Epstein, both in private Department of Justice communication and public statements.
An internal DoJ memo dated 19 December 2019 revealed prosecutors were interested in speaking to him. “We are in the process of obtaining the name of a lawyer who represents Prince Andrew. Once we have this contact information, we plan to request an interview,” a footnote in the memo states.
Epstein died in jail several months earlier, while awaiting his Manhattan federal sex-trafficking trial. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 of sex trafficking for her involvement in Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls.
Geoffrey Berman, who was the Manhattan US attorney overseeing Epstein’s prosecution, repeatedly criticized Mountbatten-Windsor for alleged unwillingness to help their investigation. Berman said on 27 January 2020 Mountbatten-Windsor had provided “zero” cooperation in their Epstein investigation despite his promises to help.
“Contrary to Prince Andrew’s very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,” Berman similarly said on 9 March 2020.
“Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate with an ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, even though the Prince has not given an interview to federal authorities, has repeatedly declined our request to schedule such an interview, and nearly four months ago informed us unequivocally – through the very same counsel who issued today’s release – that he would not come in for such an interview,” Berman said in a statement.
“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”
Contact information for Mountbatten-Windsor’s press representative was not immediately available.

Council CEO hiring process may have broken governance principles, insiders say

Council CEO hiring process may have broken governance principles, insiders say
Redland City Council may have gone against principles of the Local Government Act when it changed a hiring process for a $500,000 CEO job in a secretive meeting, according to sources with local governance experience.
The bayside south-east Queensland council appointed an internal applicant, Louise Rusan, to the $500,000 role in February last year, despite her not being shortlisted by an independent recruiter or being chosen by a panel as a top candidate.
Leaked documents obtained by this masthead showed a process where a staffer who reported to then acting CEO Rusan chaired the panel, and a decision made in a closed-door meeting, forbidden by council policy, altered the agreed-upon recruitment process.
This masthead is not suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of Louise Rusan, just that there were irregularities with the hiring process that saw her installed as council CEO.
Sources with experience in local government processes, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter as they still work in the sector, said the process was worrying, and might not have complied with the principles of the Local Government Act.
The five principles of the act are that councils must ensure processes are transparent and effective, follow good governance, make sure councillors behave ethically and legally, have sustainable development and have democratic representation.
Two sources said it could be argued the council went against at least the first three of those principles by failing to act transparently, and three said it was unusual that the mayor did not chair the selection process.
One source said the second two principles, relating to good governance and ethical behaviour, may also not have been fully complied with.
A council spokesperson was unable to respond on Thursday afternoon about whether the principles were broken, but said they would reply on Friday.
The documents show that a closed-door meeting decided to wedge Rusan into a final-round interview, going against a council policy that decisions cannot be made in such meetings.
The change irked long-time councillor Wendy Boglary, who wrote to integrity experts employed by the council.
“I am concerned that this deviation from the agreed process, including an inappropriate vote, may have influenced the selection outcome,” she said in an email obtained by this masthead.
In November 2024, the council voted in favour of a process where a panel consisting of mayor Jos Mitchell, deputy mayor Julie Talty, and two external members, and chaired by acting head of human resources Micah Beaumont, would recommend preferred candidates to present to the council.
That occurred, but following presentations by the two chosen candidates, the council decided to eliminate one of the preferred candidates and to hear from Rusan, in a meeting that excluded the independent panel members.
“The majority of councillors supported [the other preferred candidate] but requested to hear from the third ranked candidate, being Louise Rusan,” Beaumont, who reported to Rusan as acting CEO, wrote to the panel following the meeting.
It is unclear how Rusan became the third ranked candidate despite not being on a shortlist for the job.
In her email to the audit and risk committee, Boglary said the altered process opened the recruitment up to political interference.
“Given this was strongly driven by a councillor, Deputy Mayor Julie Talty, it could be perceived as political influence, which, in my opinion, undermines the principles of good governance,” she said, seeking advice about “how to manage the impending risks associated with this recruitment process”.
Talty, who has served on the council since 2012, is yet to respond to questions from this masthead.
Boglary also refused to comment, other than to say her issue was not with Rusan’s appointment but the process behind it.
A council spokesperson said the process followed the organisation’s recruitment guidelines, which do not stop employees with working relationships from being on the panel, but includes conflict-of-interest provisions.
The head of human resources – the position Beaumont was acting in – also chaired the recruitment panel the last time the council selected a new CEO in 2017, the spokesperson said.
Neil Henderson, the state secretary for The Services Union Queensland, who represents workers at the council, said the process for hiring such a well-paid and important position must be “fair, rigorous and transparent”.
“The public should be able to have absolute confidence that persons recruited for such a high-paying important role are the best available for the job,” he said.
Local Government Minister Anne Leahy would not say whether the state should take action at the council, but said the hiring of a CEO was a matter for the council.
A governance adviser was appointed at the council in late 2025 following a year of infighting that saw more than 10 per cent of complaints to the state council watchdog generated from the Redlands.

Voll's first big step in 'massive role' as Australia beats India in second T20

04:00:53 KST

Australia beat India by 19 runs in the second Twenty20 after losing the first game.
Georgia Voll, replacing Alyssa Healy as opener after captain's retirement, notched 88 at Manuka Oval, which is her highest score in the format.
What's next?
Australia plays India in the third T20 in Adelaide before three ODIs and a Test.
As a starry-eyed youngster, Georgia Voll was inspired watching Alyssa Healy thrash the cricket ball around stadiums across the world.
The 22-year-old now feels she has an obligation to keep the legacy going as she prepares to take over the mantle as one of Australia's openers after Healy's impending retirement.
"It's a massive role at the top, to try and fill Midge's shoes," Voll said.
"She's someone who's been incredible for such a long period of time.
"Being a fan of the game and watching her over a long time, and to be able to put my own little spin on it as well has been super fun."
Voll hammered a game-defining 88 from 57 balls to guide Australia to 5-163 in their second Twenty20 against India on Thursday night in Canberra.
Their opponents could not overcome the target, slumping to 9-144 after some tidy bowling by Ashleigh Gardner (3-22), Annabel Sutherland (2-18) and Kim Garth (2-16).
But the victory for Voll meant a lot as it was her highest T20 international score.
But to Voll's benefit, she now gets to work with another one of her idols, Beth Mooney, whose 46 off 39 in Canberra took her past Meg Lanning (3,405) as Australia's greatest T20 run-scorer.

"I've known Moons for a long time and worked alongside her as a 16-year-old," Voll said.
"There's a reason why she's one of the best batters in the world … it's great to have her experience up the other end.
"She's the calm head. When I'm chunking the ball down the leg-side, she comes down and lets me know that it's all right. It turns your headspace."
Voll and Australia are now turning their attention to their final T20 match against India on Saturday in Adelaide, which will also be their fourth-last Twenty20 clash before June's World Cup in England and Wales.
After her side lost their first game of their bilateral series against the women in blue last Sunday, Voll believes they are back on track.
"We've been a part of playing franchise cricket for the last few months," she said.
"It was nice to get out there tonight and show what we're capable of as a group again. I'm sure that I'll take a lot of confidence going into Adelaide."
In announcing her retirement, Healy said she would not play the T20s to allow the team to prepare for the World Cup, but will link back up with the team for three ODIs and a Test.

Simulations shed light on how snowman-shaped body in Kuiper belt may have formed
Unknown

04:00:12 KST

It is the most distant and primitive object ever visited by a spacecraft from Earth: now researchers say they have fresh insights into how the ultra-red, 4bn-year-old body known as Arrokoth came to have its distinctive snowman-like shape.
Arrokoth sits in the Kuiper belt, a vast, thick ring of icy objects that lies beyond the orbit of Neptune. This region of space is home to most of the known dwarf planets as well as comets and small, solid rubble heaps called planetesimals – the building blocks of planets.
Not all of these planetesimals are rounded: indeed, astronomers estimate 10-25% of those found in the Kuiper belt, including Arrokoth, have two lobes, meaning they look a bit like a peanut or a snowman.
Experts have previously said Arrokoth’s shape, composition and small number of craters suggests both lobes formed at the same time and in a non-violent way, proposing that this could have occurred through a process known as gravitational collapse. However, the details of just how this would have happened have been debated.
Now researchers have used computer simulations to show that gravitational collapse can indeed produce such double-lobed objects, and to shed light on the mechanism.
“It’s so exciting because we can actually see this for the first time,” said Jackson Barnes, the first author of the research, based at Michigan State University. “This is something that we’ve never been able to see from beginning to end, confirming this entire process.”
As Barnes notes, the Kuiper belt is a remnant of the solar system’s primordial protoplanetary disk, within which vast rotating clouds of pebbles are thought to have formed. In the gravitational collapse scenario, gravitation forces within these clouds caused the pebbles to form into clumps, or planetesimals, of different sizes.
Writing in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Barnes and colleagues report how they ran 54 simulations involving an initial pebble cloud containing 105 particles, each with a radius of about 2km (1.25 miles). This is a low-resolution model of the true situation as it is thought real pebble clouds would have contained about 1024 millimetre-sized particles.
The team found that in some cases two small planetesimals ended up orbiting each other, eventually spiralling inwards until, at velocities of about 5 metres a second or less, they touched and joined, forming a doubled-lobed planetesimal, or “contact binary”.
“Some of the contact binaries in our model look strikingly like Arrokoth,” Barnes said.
He noted that researchers had simulated gravitational collapse before but, unlike the new approach, they did not take into account the physics of how particles rest upon each other when they make contact. As a result, these simulations suggested any collision between smaller planetesimals would simply result in one larger, spherical object.
Barnes said the new simulations were also important because they supported the long-held view that planetesimals in general were formed through gravitational collapse.
Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute and principal investigator of Nasa’s New Horizons mission to the Kuiper belt, welcomed the study.
“It’s in agreement with previous work and support[s] the hypothesis that Kuiper belt object Arrokoth, which New Horizons explored in a close flyby, is the result of gentle formation processes,” he said.
Alan Fitzsimmons, an emeritus professor of astronomy at Queen’s University Belfast, noted that the simulations only suggested 4% of objects “out there” formed as contact binaries.
“Telescopic surveys imply much higher fractions,” he said. “It may be that Mother Nature prefers other ways of making them, or that future even more complex simulations can close the gap between what is calculated and what we see.”

Extreme heat lab: enduring the climate of the future

What heat does to your body
After the first experiment, Jay explains to me what I just went
through.
"So whenever people think about hot weather, they always talk about
the temperature," he says.
"There's two issues with that. First of all, most people don't
realise that the temperature is measured in the shade.
"So if you're in direct solar radiation, the amount of heat stress
you're exposed to is much greater as it will stress your body out a
lot more."
That explains the heat lamps. And, according to Jay, the other
important variable is the humidity.
"Humidity is the amount of water vapour that's in the air. And the
reason that's important is that the only way in which your body can
physiologically keep cool is that you produce sweat.
"But it's not production of sweat that cools you down. It's the
evaporation of sweat and it's the humidity in the air that prevents
that sweat from evaporating, even though the ambient temperature
might be the same."
So when high humidity goes along with extreme temperatures, your
body can no longer cool itself down, and the heat becomes deadly.
This is why in the next experiment I'm going to experience
conditions at the same temperature as the first experiment, but with
a much higher humidity of 36%.
Even though 36% relative humidity doesn't sound high, at 43C that
means a lot of moisture because warmer air can hold more water. When
it's this hot, sweating isn't going to help me stay cool very much.
Another way to think about it is the "feels like" temperature that
weather forecasts sometimes tell us about. Under the conditions I am
experiencing, the "feels like" temperature is over 49C or 120F.

From the Château de Versailles to the Elysée, the unshakable Catherine Pégard
France

In cultural circles, rumors had been circulating for several weeks: Catherine Pégard, Emmanuel Macron's culture adviser at the Elysée since September, might replace Rachida Dati at the Ministry of Culture if Dati chooses to fully focus on her Paris mayoral campaign ahead of the municipal elections scheduled for March 15 and 22. For now, however, the candidate for Paris City Hall – whose home and offices were searched in December 2025 as part of a judicial investigation into corruption and influence peddling related to her time as a member of the European Parliament – does not appear to be in any rush to pack her bags. Asked by Sud Radio on November 5 whether it was possible to serve as both minister and candidate, Dati replied without hesitation: "Everything is compatible."
When questioned at the end of December about the rumors that could see her appointed to the Ministry of Culture, Pégard stiffened. "That is not the issue," she replied, her face expressionless and lips tightly pressed together, in her small, spartan office on the first floor of the west wing of the Elysée. At 71, the former political journalist, who served in Nicolas Sarkozy's staff between 2007 and 2011 before overseeing the Château de Versailles for 12 and a half years, was all too familiar with the fleeting nature of political whispers. She had already been considered for the Ministry of Culture in 2022, but Macron ultimately chose his then cultural adviser at the Elysée, Rima Abdul Malak.
She is also well aware that other candidates, with more political experience or stronger credentials, are being considered. Chief among them is the affable Philippe Bélaval, who spent 40 years working in the cultural sector at the Opéra de Paris, the French National Library, the French National Archives and the National Monuments Center. There's only one blemish on his record: In 2016, he failed to take the helm of the Château de Versailles, where Pégard began her second term. A graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration and Macron's culture adviser from 2023 to June 2025, he left the Elysée for personal reasons in the spring, though he remained in charge of the thorny issue of loaning the Bayeux Tapestry to the United Kingdom.

Netherlands to allocate additional EUR 2 mln to help return Ukrainian children
The Netherlands will allocate an additional EUR 2 million in 2026 for the identification and return to Ukraine of children abducted by Russia, including the provision of DNA testing kits, Roos Bos, who is responsible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' activities in the area of combating child abduction, reported.
“Children are still being deliberately removed from Ukraine. Some have been forcibly adopted and placed in Russian families. There is only one reason Russia is doing this: the aim is to destroy Ukraine’s identity and culture and undermine its existence as an independent country,” she wrote in a blog on the Dutch government’s website.
Roos noted that most of the funds provided are earmarked for the supply of DNA testing kits, while the rest is for psychosocial support for children.
“The aim is to enable Ukraine to create a DNA database so that children who return from Russia can be reunited with their families as quickly as possible. Some of this financial support also helps provide psychosocial care for children who have returned to Ukraine from Russia. That is vital, because they often come back traumatised by their treatment by Russian occupying forces and authorities, which can include aggressive indoctrination,” she said.
According to her, DNA analysis has so far yielded impressive results.
“Collection of about 2,000 DNA samples from Ukrainian parents looking for missing children (as of late 2025). Collection of genetic material from more than 3,600 personal items belonging to Ukrainian children who have disappeared from children’s homes and other institutions. Identification of children killed in Russian acts of aggression, and the dignified return of bodies to families,” the diplomat noted.
Roos noted that the DNA database helps build evidence of child abductions, which will support prosecution of war crimes by courts, including the International Criminal Court.

'Canary in the coal mine': The possum on the frontline of Australia's extinction crisis
Unknown

In Brief
- The lemuroid ringtail possum is one of 34 species that have just been added to Australia's threatened species list.
- Researchers say the scale and pace of man-made climate change has made it nearly impossible for species to adapt to changes.
Australia’s unique wildlife is facing an escalating extinction crisis and researchers say urgent climate action and stronger environmental protections are critical to prevent further irreversible loss of Australia's signature biodiversity.
While Australia is famed around the world for its vast array of unique plants and animals, it also has the highest rate of mammal extinction in the world and the second highest rate of biodiversity loss.
Conservation experts say Australia could lose many of these distinctive species in the near future.
Jess Abrahams, national nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said Australia's wildlife is being sent "to extinction" by climate change and other threats.
"We now have more than 2,300 plants, animals, and ecosystems threatened with extinction in Australia, and the list keeps growing.
"And unless we take some really urgent action to protect these unique plants and animals, our future generations won't be able to enjoy the unique nature that we have grown up with."
Species on the frontline
One animal on the frontline of this battle with a rapidly warming climate is the lemuroid ringtail possum.
The possum, native to north Queensland's Wet Tropics rainforests, is one of 34 species that have just been added to Australia's threatened species list as of February 2026.
Stephen Williams, who recently retired as a professor of biodiversity and climate change at James Cook University, has spent around 35 years studying the creatures.
He said he nominated the lemuroid ringtail possum as an endangered species in 2022 after noticing a rapid decline due to heatwaves and an increase in average temperatures.
"We've already lost about 60 per cent of the population of lemuroid ringtails in the last 15 years. And the predictions are that they're going to be almost extinct or extinct by about 2040 to 2050 kind of range.
"The increasing temperature, just the average temperatures across the whole year, decreases their reproductive biology, stops them breeding as much.
"And so there's sort of a double whammy. They're getting increased mortality and you're also getting decreased births. "
Abrahams said the decades of research gathered by Williams and his team showed the possums were constantly migrating higher and higher in their environment to escape the heat.
"It cannot survive under heatwave conditions, and it must climb higher and higher up the mountains to find cooler environments. But so many of our wildlife that are already living in higher altitude areas, when climate change comes, there's literally nowhere higher to climb. They're literally falling off the top of the mountain."
Williams said he didn't intend on focusing his research on the impacts of climate change but its vast destructive impacts became unavoidable to him as early as 2003.
"I was studying rainforest animals with no intention of working on climate change. We did some analysis which showed that if things continued the way they were going, that about 50 per cent of the species that I worked on would go extinct by the end of this century.
"And that just completely blew my mind and I sort of thought, 'Well, there's not really much point in studying anything else at this stage.'"
Professor James Watson, a conservation researcher from the the University of Queensland, said the length of Williams' research offers a unique look at the threats that many other species are likely experiencing without researchers knowing.
"The fear is obviously that the lemuroid possum is kind of the canary in the coal mine. It's well studied. But there are tons of species that we don't know are actually being affected because they're not being monitored.
"So we suspect there's a massive underestimate on the amount of species actually imperilled by climate change."
What can be done to protect the lemuroid ringtail possum?
Abrahams said adding the possum to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act's threatened species list helps to raise their status to a "matter of national environmental significance" that is protected under Australia's national environment laws.
Australia's federal Environmental Protection Agency is scheduled to begin operations in July after a slate of environmental protection reforms were passed last year, however, Abrahams said the protections under the agency will need to be rigorous.
"There are also new rules and standards under these new laws, and the details of those rules are still being hashed out. But if these rules aren't strong, if they're full of loopholes, well an animal being added to the threatened species list perhaps won't give it the protection that it needs and they will still be at risk from extinction."
'Extreme' changes to climate
Williams said he and his colleagues have spent decades helping the lemuroid ringtail possum and other species adapt, but unless the pace of climate change is slowed by a rapid reduction of carbon emissions in Australia and around the world, their efforts will not amount to much.
"All these adaptation actions that we take in terms of protecting refugia, keeping animals in captivity, moving them around, whatever it is we do, it is still kind of fiddling at the edges a bit.
"It's doing the best we can, but the main thing that needs doing is stopping the temperature going too much higher. We're already at one and a half degrees, which is already a level which all of my analysis over the last 30 years says that the impacts will start to become worse and accelerate rapidly from one and a half degrees on."
Watson said most animals have an inherent ability to adapt to a changing climate, but the scale and pace of man-made climate change has made it nearly impossible for them to keep up with these changes.
He said humans have a duty to safeguard vulnerable animals as best as they can until the Earth can begin to recover from this damage.
"Every species that has evolved on Earth has undergone some kind of pressure from a changing climate simply because the climate is always changing. This climate changing event caused by humans is different. It's more extreme," he said.
"It's going to take hundreds of years for the climate to get back to normal. Even if we stop bad behaviour right now. These species are going to have to go through this kind of climate bottleneck, and we have to allow these species to have the best fighting chance."

Starlink loss a blow to Russian forces in Ukraine, say experts
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Elon Musk's Starlink cut-off likely disrupted Russian tactical command, restricting offensive capacity. Ukraine's defence adviser called it a "catastrophe" for crucial drone and command links.
- Russia sought Starlink accounts via Ukrainians and deployed less reliable Yamal/Express satellites. These large antennas are now Ukrainian targets, forcing Russia to move them back.
- Ukraine is exploiting Starlink disruption, regaining territory and launching counter-attacks. However, the overall impact on the conflict remains slow, with no dramatic shifts noted yet.

PARIS - US tech titan Elon Musk’s move to cut Russian access
Here is what we know about the importance of Starlink to Russia and in the Ukraine conflict:
Critical command and control role
Linking Russian drones to the Starlink satellites operated by Mr Musk’s SpaceX company
The satellites are also important for Russia’s command and control, “the organisation of the operational chain that allows the military at the top to give orders to all levels of responsibility, down to the combatants,” said a western military source.
“All armies that have a little money and need bandwidth use Starlink. It’s flexible, it’s not expensive, and it complements military systems that do not allow for increased bandwidth,” the source added.
In the Ukraine conflict, the US satellites “gave Russian units real-time control over their forces and drones, to have an overview of the line of contact” so they could make better decisions, Commander Yuriy Fedorenko, of Ukraine’s 429th Achilles Drone Brigade told Freedom TV.
The satellites are even more important as there is no real front line where the Russia and Ukrainian armies are in contact, according to a high-ranking European officer.
“It is a ‘kill zone’ several kilometres wide, patrolled by drones, where small mobile squads operate, trying to strike here and there,” the officer told AFP.
“Many Russian soldiers constantly move through the area. These are critical points,” Mr Serhii Beskrestnov, a technology adviser to the Ukrainian defence ministry, told AFP.
Blackout fallout
Ukraine says that blocking Starlink has an enormous impact on Russian forces.
AFP has not been able to independently assess the fallout.
“For the Russians, this is not just a problem, it is a catastrophe,” said Mr Beskrestnov. “We knew that they used Starlink on the front”, but “we did not believe that it was this crucial.”
The Russian side played down the consequences. Mr Valery Tishkov, a communications official for the Russian military, said that Starlink was only used marginally and that the army “has all modern, domestically-produced communication services. The operations control system functions reliably and ensures the command and control of troops at the front.”
How will Russia adapt?
According to several Ukrainian sources, Russia has sought to pay Ukrainians to organise legitimate Starlink accounts that it can then use for its drones at the front.
Ukraine’s SBU security service has warned that this is a crime punishable by a sentence jail of life.
Russia has deployed alternative solutions, according to the Ukrainian sources, but these are not as reliable as Starlink’s low orbiting network. Russia has instead used its Yamal and Express geo-stationary satellites that are higher up and there are fewer of them.
“They need a satellite receiver equipped with a large parabolic antenna,” said Mr Beskrestnov.
These are now a prime target for Ukrainian forces and Russia has had to move back the antennae by 10-15 kilometres and deploy reinforced wi-fi from the receivers to the front lines.
“We are trying to locate these terminals,” said the adviser.
Decisive in conflict?
Ukrainian forces regained territory from Russia in February, a rare occurrence during the four years of war when they have gradually lost terrain amidst bitter battles that have cost thousands of lives.
On Feb 5, Russian military observers reported disruption of the Starlink internet terminals used by Moscow on the front lines after Musk took measures following a request from Kyiv.
A senior Ukrainian military official said that counter-attacks had been launched all along the front line in a single day, but gave no further details.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War says that Ukrainian forces are probably taking advantage of Russia’s loss of Starlink.
But so far there have been no dramatic changes. The European military source said that “very few troops are making direct contact with opposing soldiers, and there is no mechanised combat (which could force a breakthrough), so progress is very slow.” AFP

Zelensky discusses impact of Russian attacks with UN High Commissioner for Refugees
Zelensky stated this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"We discussed the consequences of Russia's ongoing attacks on Ukraine's energy system and the assistance our people need. There must be more pressure to stop these attacks and more support for our people – especially those who are currently in Ukraine or planning to return," Zelensky stated.
He expressed gratitude to Salih for his first visit to Ukraine in his role as High Commissioner and for all the support the UNHCR provides to Ukrainians living under Russian attacks.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the United Nations has confirmed that more than 15,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the start of the full-scale war.

Iran and US expand military readiness amid nuclear negotiations

Iran has reinforced key military and nuclear facilities with concrete and earth barriers as the United States increases its military presence in the Middle East and President Donald Trump renews threats of action if talks fail.
New satellite images published by Reuters and verified by BBC Verify show extensive construction at sensitive Iranian sites, including the Parchin military complex southeast of Tehran. Analysts say a newly built structure at Parchin has been encased in concrete and covered with soil, a move designed to shield it from aerial attack.
Al Jazeera reported that the Institute for Science and International Security said in a January analysis that Iran appeared to be building what it described as a “concrete sarcophagus” around a facility known as Taleghan 2. The institute’s founder, David Albright, wrote that the work would provide “significant protection from aerial strikes”.
Images dated between October 2024 and February 2026 show reconstruction after reported Israeli strikes in 2024, followed by the erection of a metal frame, installation of a roof and eventual covering of the site in concrete and earth. Western intelligence agencies have long linked Parchin to past weapons-related research, an allegation Tehran denies. Iran maintains that its nuclear programme serves civilian energy needs.
Further satellite imagery indicates that Iran has buried tunnel entrances at the Isfahan nuclear complex, one of three enrichment sites targeted by US strikes last summer during a 12-day conflict involving Israel and the United States. Analysts cited by Reuters said the entrances were fully covered by early February.
Near Natanz, another major enrichment facility, images show reinforced tunnel openings in a mountain complex about 2km from the main site.
The activity coincides with a significant US military build-up. According to US media reports, Washington has deployed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to waters near Iran, along with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets. The USS Gerald R Ford is expected to arrive in the region within weeks.
Axios reported that more than 150 US military aircraft have transported weapons systems and munitions to the Middle East in recent days. The Wall Street Journal described the concentration of air power as the largest since the 2003 Iraq invasion. The Pentagon has also repositioned some personnel out of exposed areas as a precaution, according to CBS News.
Speaking at the inaugural meeting of his Board of Peace initiative in Washington, Trump said the United States had “some work to do with Iran”. He repeated his demand that Tehran end its nuclear programme. “They can’t have a nuclear weapon. Very simple. You can’t have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon,” he said.
Trump added that negotiations were under way but warned that other options remained open. “We may have to take it a step further, or we may not. Maybe we’re going to make a deal. You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days,” he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said after recent indirect talks in Geneva that an understanding had been reached on “guiding principles” for further negotiations. Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, whose country is mediating the talks, said discussions had concluded with “good progress” on common aims and technical matters.
Tehran has insisted that any agreement must focus on its nuclear activities and sanctions relief. Washington has indicated that missile development and regional alliances should also form part of any deal.
US lawmakers have reacted to the prospect of military action. Congressmen Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie said they would introduce a war powers resolution to require congressional approval before any strike on Iran. Khanna said the president “can’t” launch a war without Congress.
Iranian authorities advised airlines to avoid certain Middle Eastern airspace during military exercises in the Gulf.
Iran continues to deny that it seeks nuclear weapons. The United Nations nuclear watchdog has previously said it found no evidence that Tehran was actively pursuing a bomb.

Trump changed mind on Chagos deal ‘after UK blocked use of Diego Garcia for Iran strikes’

Donald Trump changed his mind on supporting the Chagos Islands deal because the UK will not permit its airbases to be used for a pre-emptive US strike on Iran, the Guardian has been told.
In his latest change of heart on the deal, the US president said on social media that Keir Starmer was “making a big mistake” by handing sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius in exchange for continued use by the UK and US of their airbase on one of the islands, Diego Garcia.
While Trump had previously criticised the plan, which is backed by the US state department, earlier in February he had described it as the “best” deal Starmer could make in the circumstances.
But in Trump’s post on his own Truth Social site he linked the deal with US military strikes against Iran in connection with Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which are believed to be imminent. He wrote: “Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.”
A pre-emptive strike on Iran would be unlikely to be in line with the UK’s interpretation of international law. US bases in the UK, like Fairford in Gloucestershire, the home for US B-2 bombers in Europe, are only used for military operations if the UK government agrees and they are considered legal.
UK government sources said this was viewed as the reason for Trump to again turn against the Chagos plan.
On Tuesday night, Starmer and Trump spoke in a conversation that covered the situation in Iran, although the Downing Street readout of the call made no mention of the Chagos plan.
The hope in No 10 is that Trump will again change his mind. The bill setting out the Chagos agreement is due to return to the House of Lords soon.
There has been speculation that the bill, which is nearing its final stages but was delayed last month amid continued uncertainty about the US position, might have returned to the Lords next week. However, it is now not expected for several weeks.
Under parliamentary rules, if it is not passed before the end of the current parliamentary session in May, the bill would have to be presented again.
One former government official who worked closely on the deal said he was concerned it might be scuppered. Ben Judah, who was until recently a special adviser to David Lammy, the former foreign secretary, told a Sun podcast: “It’s looking tricky for the government to get this deal through in the weeks and month ahead.”
The Conservatives are continuing to push the Trump administration to block the plan, which Downing Street has said can only go ahead with US buy-in.
The shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, is giving a speech in Washington DC next week, and is expected to hold talks with US officials about the Chagos plan.
In a statement, Patel said the deal was “now dead in the water”, adding: “It’s impossible for the deal to proceed without the support of our American allies, and Labour will soon run out of time to put anything before parliament.”
A government spokesperson said: “As routine, we do not comment on operational matters. There is a political process ongoing between the US and Iran, which the UK supports. Iran must never be able to develop a nuclear weapon, and our priority is security in the region.”

HUD proposes rule that would force noncitizens from public housing
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is proposing a rule that would limit public housing mostly to citizens, which advocates fear could lead to tens of thousand of people being evicted
- Bookmark
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Thursday proposed a rule that would limit public housing mostly to citizens, which advocates fear could lead to tens of thousands of people being evicted.
The rule, published in the Federal Register, calls for limiting funding for those in public housing and other HUD-related housing to citizens and eligible noncitizens. The rule would require every resident in HUD-funded housing to show proof of citizenship or eligible status, including those 62 years and older who previously only had to show proof of age.
The measure would effectively bar mixed status families —- where some household members are eligible for help — from housing and is part of the government’s immigration crackdown. A similar rule was proposed but never finalized during the first Trump administration and is mentioned as a policy priority in the conservative blueprint Project 2025,
"Under President Trump’s leadership, the days of illegal aliens, ineligibles, and fraudsters gaming the system and riding the coattails of American taxpayers are over,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement.. “HUD’s proposed rule will guarantee that all residents in HUD-funded housing are eligible tenants. We have zero tolerance for pushing aside hardworking U.S. citizens while enabling others to exploit decades-old loopholes.”
The proposed rule will be made official when it’s published in the Federal Register on Friday. HUD did not answer how long it may take before the rule takes effect.
Housing advocates were quick to criticize the move.
“Our country can ensure that every one of us, no matter where we come from or what language we speak, has a safe home," Shamus Roller, the executive director of the National Housing Law Project said in a statement. “Instead, Trump is trying to evict immigrant families, citizen and non-citizen, from HUD housing.
In December, the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that up to 20,000 families or as many as 80,000 people could lose assistance due to changes in eligibility that would overturn a rule that has been in place for decades.
The impact of the rule could affect many more people who struggle to provide proper documentation. About 3.8 million adults with citizenship lack any form of documentation proving their citizenship, and another 17.5 million cannot easily get the documents.
“Everyone deserves an affordable home, including our neighbors, friends, and coworkers who are immigrants,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the Center. “This rule would force 20,000 families with mixed immigration statuses to make the agonizing choice between losing the assistance that helps them pay rent every month or separating their family. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for rental assistance.”

Schools in England to get budget for children with special needs as part of Send overhaul

Children in England with special needs will receive individual support and therapy directly from their schools as part of the government’s overhaul of England’s special education provision.
Under the plans, mainstream schools will be given commissioning budgets to spend on therapists or additional support, instead of the money being controlled by highly indebted local authorities.
The plans are part of a package of sweeping changes to special educational needs and disabilities (Send) provision that will be announced by the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, on Monday.
The measures are aimed at fixing deep-rooted problems with the Send system and curbing spiralling costs that have brought several councils to the brink of bankruptcy. Critics of the current system say lopsided funding mechanisms leave hundreds of thousands of children with little or no support in mainstream schools, requiring their families to battle local authorities for help.
But government officials are concerned that proposals to limit who has access to educational, health and care plans could prompt a backlash from parents’ groups and Labour MPs when it comes to a Commons vote.
Some are particularly concerned about plans to test those who hold ECHPs according to the new tougher criteria when they move up to secondary school, while others want to make sure parents can make a legal appeal if they feel schools are not meeting their children’s needs.
Meg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said: “The key thing is trust. If parents think their support could be ripped away from them they will worry.”
However, she added that unlike the welfare reforms, over which she led a successful rebellion last year, ministers had been at pains to consult Labour MPs and were not focusing the reforms on saving money.
Another Labour MP said: “The government has got everyone very, very anxious. But the truth is everyone recognises the need for reform and not letting things continue as they are.”
Government insiders say they are optimistic that a rebellion can be averted in part because the Treasury has been more generous with funding than expected.
The full package of reforms will be phased in over a decade, with mainstream schools to make extra provision and support “ordinarily available” to any pupils.
Those schools will also be expected to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate children with conditions such as autism, ADHD or mental health issues, or face potential legal action.
That action could involve appealing to an independent ombudsman, or changing equalities rules to make disabled children’s rights more explicit.
Children with special needs at mainstream schools will be eligible for individual support plans (ISPs), which offer enhanced legal rights and assurances without a child requiring an EHCP.
But policymakers say the reforms could be derailed if the government fails to make clear the benefits of the new system, including continuing protections for EHCPs, which agree the needs and support for individual children between families and councils.
The new format for EHCPs will affect children only from 2030 onwards, and will take into account the extra provision available in mainstream schools.
Those involved with the negotiations told the Guardian: “If MPs hear there are protections for EHCPs and there’s more money [in the system], I think they will come onboard.”
More than 480,000 children and young people at schools in England have EHCPs, and reports have concentrated on fears that EHCPs could be curtailed or taken away at the transition from primary to secondary school after 2030.
The first tier equalities tribunal will still be available for appeals involving EHCPs although its role will be “refocused” and take account of the other legal routes available to families.
Ministers will also introduce new price bands for independent special schools, which currently charge more than twice the cost of a state special school on average.
Under plans announced on Thursday, private providers will be forced to comply with set price bands for certain services and will have to sign up to minimum service standards.
Phillipson said: “We’re cracking down on providers who put profit before children. New standards and proper oversight will ensure every independent special school placement delivers real outcomes for children – not unreasonable bills for local authorities.”

See the full list: Private insurer price hikes — and how to save cash

In Brief
- The 4.41 per cent average increase comes into effect on 1 April.
- Experts say there are various ways you can seek to save money on your health insurance.
The federal government has approved the largest health insurance premium increase since 2017 in a move Health Minister Mark Butler said reflected the "rising costs of providing medical and hospital services".
The 4.41 per cent average premium increase will be implemented from 1 April.
However, individual policies could increase by much more. For example, financial comparison site Canstar found that despite last year’s average premium increase of 3.73 per cent, the cost of an individual gold policy rose by an average of 11.6 per cent between March and April 2025.
According to Finder, another financial comparison site, 26 per cent of people with health insurance ranked it as one of their top three most stressful bills last month.
Fourteen per cent — or around 2.1 million people — said they won’t be renewing their private health insurance this year.
Canstar analysis found an average-priced gold hospital policy for an individual could increase by $167. For families, the increase could be $330, based on the average yearly wage of $104,807 and applying the relevant private health insurance rebate.
SBS asked financial experts to share their top considerations for Australians amid the premium increase.
What is a premium?
A premium is the amount you pay an insurer for insurance cover. Depending on your individual circumstances, the cost of your premium can change.
Factors can include the type of cover you select, previous claims you’ve made, government taxes, discounts, and any optional benefits you select.
Why are insurance premiums rising?
The increasing cost of medical services, as well as higher claims costs, inflation, and more extreme weather events are behind this year’s increase, said Sarah Megginson, a personal finance expert at Finder.
In a statement, the government said the rise also reflects increasing wage bills and securing the viability of private hospitals.
How will I know how much my premium will increase by?
These are the average premium increases approved for some funds:
- ACA Health Benefits Fund: 4.48 per cent
- AIA: 5.98 per cent
- Australian Unity: 3.98 per cent
- Bupa: 4.8 per cent
- Hunter Health Insurance: 3.92 per cent
- GMHBA: 1.98 per cent
- HBF: 2.15 per cent
- HCi: 4.53 per cent
- HIF: 2.6 per cent
- Health Partners: 3.94 per cent
- HCF: 4.96 per cent
- Latrobe Health Services: 4.53 per cent
- Medibank: 5.1 per cent
- Mildura Health Fund: 4.25 per cent
- nib: 5.47 per cent
- Peoplecare: 4.01 per cent
- Phoenix Health Fund: 2.95 per cent
- Reserve Bank Health Society: 4.13 per cent
- St. Lukes: 4.25 per cent
- Westfund: 3.26 per cent
You can view the full list here and find the federal government's website to compare products here.
The government says it is up to each insurer to explain to their policyholders any changes to premiums, the reasons why they have made this decision and their policyholders’ options.
Canstar’s data insights director Sally Tindall said: "Get on the phone to your provider to understand exactly how much your premium is going up by. Then spend 30 minutes doing a health check on your insurance. It could potentially save you hundreds."
What other steps can I take to find out more about health insurance premiums?
Canstar suggests exploring options including reviewing the level of cover and extras insurance, but being wary of the risks that could come from downgrading. The financial comparison site found that if an individual switched from an average-priced gold hospital insurance to the lowest, it could potentially save them $1,397 in a year.
Another suggestion is to pre-pay the next year’s premiums at today’s prices, before 1 April when the increase kicks in. According to Canstar, many insurers will let you pre-pay the next 12 months before they increase.
Megginson agreed and said: "You don’t have to accept the first renewal quote. Comparing policies, increasing your excess where affordable and reviewing whether you need all your current cover can help lower costs."
Changing to an entirely new and cheaper provider is also an option, with some offering the same level of cover you had before.
"Switching to a comparable policy within the same tier can help mitigate or even neutralise the price hikes," Tindall said.
Even just asking about bundling policies and asking about loyalty discounts with insurers can save you money, said Megginson.

At least four people have died and 17 others have been injured after a liquid gas truck overturned and exploded in Santiago, Chile's capital, authorities confirmed on Thursday.
The driver of the vehicle, who reportedly lost control before the crash, is among the fatalities, a police chief stated.
The incident, which involved a truck affiliated with local gas company Gasco, is now under investigation by the prosecutor's office. Gasco has not yet responded to requests for comment.
Dramatic videos circulating on social media captured plumes of flames rising from the scene in Renca, a northern commune of Santiago, situated near a major highway and industrial zone. Firefighters reported that the blast was felt within a 150 to 200-metre radius, causing damage to at least 50 vehicles.
President Gabriel Boric noted that debris from the explosion struck three local businesses, though no further widespread damage has been reported.
However, the human toll remains severe, with Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region, confirming that five individuals are in serious condition. He added, "One has burns covering 100% of their body with imminent risk to their life."

How Trump is stacking the deck so his ballroom project sails through DC and comes to fruition
Trump said he plans to have the White House ballroom completed within a year and a half
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump’s grand $400 million White House ballroom design was swiftly approved by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts Thursday, clearing the first hurdle to move forward with construction months after he fired board members and replaced them with allies.
A panel of six commissioners chosen by Trump approved the latest and final design despite massive public resistance, while praising the president for designing a “beautiful structure.”
Since announcing his new ambitions for a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in July 2025, Trump has sought to expedite construction of the ballroom, which is nearly the size of the White House residence and West Wing combined.
Trump wasted no time tearing down the historic East Wing, changing initial cost estimates, and stacking two boards tasked with reviewing the construction plans with allies.
Here’s how else the president is making sure his new White House addition comes to fruition:
Demolishing the East Wing
Lawmakers and members of the public were shocked in October when construction teams began demolishing the historic East Wing of the White House – after Trump asserted the new ballroom would not “interfere” with the original building.
White House officials justified the change by saying architects had determined it was more cost-effective and structurally sound to demolish the East Wing.
But Democrats were quick to accuse the president of circumventing traditional processes of seeking permission from the National Capital Planning Commission, Commission of Fine Arts and congressional approval.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation sued the administration, hoping to halt construction. While the East Wing demolition has been completed and is therefore unable to be halted, the judge has not ruled on the new construction.
Installing allies on the Commission of Fine Arts
In October, the Trump administration fired all six members of the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts to make room for new commissioners “more aligned with President Trump’s America First Policies” after public criticisms over the demolition of the East Wing.
Typically, the seven-member panel tasked with giving expert advice to the president, Congress and D.C. government on design and aesthetic matters is made up of individuals with expertise in art, architecture, landscape architecture and urban design.
But Trump has tapped a group of individuals with a range of backgrounds, including some with no experience in the arts, to sit on the commission.
That includes 26-year-old Chamberlain Harris, the deputy director of Oval Office operations with no formal experience in art.
“This is sort of like the greatest country in the world. It’s the greatest house in the world. And we sort of want it to be the greatest ballroom in the world,” Harris said Thursday during the meeting.
James McCrery II, the architect originally hired to design the ballroom, is serving as the vice-chairman of the commission. McCrery stepped down as the architect in December. He has not participated in the review or vote on the ballroom.
The commission is being chaired by Rodney Mims Cook Jr., a developer and designer who founded the National Monuments Foundation. During the hearing, Cook offered Trump generous praise for his design and his efforts to promote world peace.
“No president has really stepped up to the plate to require that this be corrected until President Trump,” Cook said of Trump requesting a ballroom to host formal events.
The other members are: Roger Kimball, a conservative political commentator and art critic. Mary Anne Carter, the chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Arts, previously worked as a policy adviser in Florida. Pam Patenaude, who worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the first Trump administration and second Bush administration. Matthew Taylor, a conceptual artist and film director who previously worked with Rudy Giuliani.
Installing allies on the National Capital Planning Commission
In December, a federal judge asked the government to maintain its promise to submit plans to both the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission, which is tasked with reviewing and providing guidance for construction projects on federal land and buildings.
In preparation to have plans go before the commission, Trump installed his former personal lawyer and current White House Staff Secretary, Will Scharf, as the chairman.
James “Michael” Blair, a White House official, has been installed as its commissioner. Stuart Levenbach, the chief statistician of the United States, was appointed vice chairman.
The National Capital Planning Commission is expected to review the design plans March 5.
Using private donors to pay for increasing costs
Initially, the president asserted the ballroom would cost around $200 million and promised to pay for it himself to avoid burdening taxpayers. But that price has doubled to $400 million and now requires donations from private companies and individuals.
That includes tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Google, HP and Microsoft. Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Palantir Technologies and T-Mobile are also among the reported donors.
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an ethics watchdog group, said the donations raise concerns about corruption.
“All of this money that they’re giving for something that’s important to the president could influence his decision-making, and he could be thinking about that instead of thinking about what’s best for the American people,” Noah Bookbinder, the president of CREW, told Axios.
The president and his allies have said it's necessary to build the ballroom because the White House currently does not have enough space to host large events. Currently, the White House will use outdoor tents to expand space – which has raised security concerns.
Trump plans to have the ballroom built and open to guests by summer 2028, giving builders roughly a year and a half to construct the new event space.

Trump announces billions of dollars in Gaza aid at Board of Peace meeting
Donald Trump announces pledges to a Gaza reconstruction fund during the first meeting of his Board of Peace.
Donald Trump has told the first meeting of his Board of Peace that nine member nations have pledged $7bn to a reconstruction fund for the Gaza Strip, with five countries agreeing to deploy troops to an international stabilisation force for the Palestinian territory.
Addressing the board in a meeting in Washington, DC, on Thursday, the United States president said the US will make a contribution of $10bn to the Board of Peace, although he didn’t specify what the money will be used for.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait have raised an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction, Trump said.
“Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of a new and harmonious [region],” said Trump. He added, “The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room.”
The funds pledged, while significant, represent a fraction of the estimated $70bn needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory that has been decimated after more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war.
Proposed stabilisation force
Meanwhile, Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops for the Gaza stabilisation force, part of Trump’s 20-point plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza. Egypt and Jordan have committed to training police officers.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his country would contribute up to 8,000 troops to the proposed force “to make this peace work”.
The force, led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, will start in the Israeli-controlled city of Rafah and train a new police force, eventually aiming to prepare 12,000 police and have 20,000 troops.
While the disarmament of Hamas was a part of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza, the group has been reluctant to hand over weaponry as Israel continues to carry out daily attacks on Gaza.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must “monitor the ceasefire and prevent the [Israeli] occupation from continuing its aggression.” Disarmament could be discussed, he said, without directly committing to it.
Trump first proposed the board last September as part of his plan to end the war. But since the October “ceasefire”, Trump’s vision for the board has morphed, and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit to tackle other conflicts worldwide.
The board has faced criticism for including Israeli representatives but not Palestinians.
Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said that Palestinians want to see concrete solutions rather than pledges.
“Past experiences with conferences, with regard to reconstruction, with regard to the peace process, all ended up with large needs for funding that were delayed or [plans] that were not implemented,” he said.
“Palestinians don’t want to see this again; they don’t want to see the Board of Peace as another international body that falls into the category of crisis management rather than finding a tangible solution to this longstanding problem, the Palestinian problem,” Mahmoud noted.
More than 40 countries and the European Union confirmed they were sending officials to Thursday’s meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board, but are taking part as observers.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrest: History of his royal homes – from Wood Farm to Royal Lodge
Police searches were being carried out at both Wood Farm and Royal Lodge
- Bookmark
Following the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, police searches were being carried out at both Wood Farm and Royal Lodge.
Unmarked police cars were seen at his temporary home on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.
Plain clothes officers were also at his former residence in Windsor Great Park.
Earlier this month, Andrew moved out of his home in Windsor to the Sandringham Estate.
Here is a look at the history of his royal homes:
Wood Farm
Andrew temporarily relocated to Wood Farm on the King’s private Sandringham estate in Norfolk this month after leaving Royal Lodge, while waiting for his new home, Marsh Farm, to be ready nearby.
His father Prince Philip, the late Duke of Edinburgh, spent much of his retirement at Wood Farm.
The late Queen once said her husband “loved” the property and part of its attraction was because the “sea was so close”.
Located in Wolferton, it is nestled in the far reaches of the vast 20,000-estate.
It was originally a large farmhouse before being converted into two cottages and over the years was used as a regular informal weekend retreat by the royals, particularly for annual shooting parties.
Philip is said to have organised the installation of a new kitchen in the modestly furnished cottage.
Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson frequently stayed there alone as a guest of the late Queen over the Christmas period following her separation from Andrew in the 1990s.
While the duchess’s children Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie joined their royal relatives for festivities at nearby Sandringham House, “Fergie” was exiled to Wood Farm, and was not invited.
She described it in her autobiography as a “comfortable open beamed cottage two miles from the ‘big house’”.
Teresa Thompson, the cottage’s retired housekeeper, said after chatting to the Queen at an event in Sandringham to mark the Platinum Jubilee in 2022: “All the royal family love Wood Farm, because it’s out of the way, it’s small, It’s intimate. You haven’t got lots of officials and household, it’s just the close staff.
“And they literally can relax in the family house, it’s wonderful, and I had a wonderful 22 years down there, it was the best time of my life without a doubt.”
In 1917, it was where Prince John, the youngest son of George V, moved with his nurse.
An epileptic, John was kept apart from the rest of his family and died at Wood Farm two years later from a severe seizure at the age of 13.
Royal Lodge
In what was dubbed the siege of Royal Lodge, Andrew faced growing pressure to give up his 30-room mansion after it emerged last year he had been paying a “peppercorn” rent for decades.
He finally agreed to quit the property in Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, for a new home on the King’s private Sandringham estate in the New Year, with Charles personally funding him with an annual stipend.
The secluded 19th century Grade II-listed Royal Lodge is nestled in 98 acres of private land.
From 1815, it was used by Prince Regent, later George IV, as a hunting lodge.
King William IV had it almost completely demolished and rebuilt in 1830.
By 1840 it was used as grace-and-favour accommodation for senior members of the royal household.
In the 1930s, it became the country retreat of Andrew’s grandparents, the Queen Mother and King George VI, when they were the Duke and Duchess of York, and their children Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret learned to swim in its pool as youngsters.
Part of the Crown Estate, it remained the Queen Mother’s favourite Windsor residence for 50 years, and she died there in 2002.
Andrew then took over the home, using it as his main residence for more than 20 years, with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson also later moving in.
It was previously a distinctive Windsor pink but after Andrew signed a 75-year lease in 2003, he began refurbishments, including painting it white.
A copy of the leasehold agreement revealed he paid £1 million for the lease and that since then, he paid just “one peppercorn” of rent “if demanded” per year.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have announced their intention to allocate a total of $4.2 billion to finance the activities of the Board of Peace for Gaza, according to the statements by their representatives at the Board of Peace first meeting in Washington.
The United Arab Emirates has committed to allocate the largest contribution worth $1.2 billion. "Today, Mr. President the UAE announces a further $1.2 billion for supporting Gaza through the Board of Peace," UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said. He recalled that Abu Dhabi has allocated $3 billion in assistance to the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip since the outbreak of the current escalation.
According to Qatari Prime Miniser and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, Doha "pledges $1 billion in support to the board of to award mission aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfills Palestinian aspiration for the statehood and recognition and the Israeli aspiration for security and integration."
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel bin Ahmad al-Jubeir, in turn, reiterated his country’s commitment to "establishing a lasting and just peace in the Middle East" that will result "in two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security." He also announced the pledge to allocate $1 billion to the Board of Peace within the next few years.
Kuwait also joined the donor states pledging $1 billion to support Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. According to Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Jarrah Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the money will be allocated over the next few years.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to US President Donald Trump, more countries have joined it. While the Board was established under the agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.

Türkiye urged permanent ceasefire, inclusive political process in Sudan
'The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire,' says UN envoy
HAMILTON, Canada
Türkiye's UN envoy urged a permanent ceasefire and an inclusive political process in Sudan on Thursday, stressing that any resolution must be Sudanese-led to ensure lasting stability.
"Türkiye is gravely concerned regarding the ongoing conflict and the humanitarian situation in Sudan," Ahmet Yildiz said during a Security Council session on Sudan.
Reaffirming Ankara's support for Sudan's territorial integrity, he said Türkiye supports "Sudan's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, which we consider very important for the stability of Sudan and the whole region."
Pointing to the role of external actors in prolonging the fighting, he said, "We also note with grave concern the negative impact of foreign interference in Sudan and its implications on the continuation of the conflict, as well as the potential spillover risks it creates on the wider region."
"Türkiye is of the opinion that the most effective way for ending the conflict is dialogue and diplomacy," he noted.
Emphasizing the need for a meaningful outcome of peace talks, he said Türkiye believes "that this outcome cannot be achieved if the dialogue is not owned and led by Sudan."
Calling on international partners to support a comprehensive solution, Yildiz added, "The efforts of the international partners should turn into an inclusive peace process that will enable a permanent ceasefire, followed by a comprehensive political process and accountability."
He also noted that Türkiye continues to provide humanitarian assistance and urged the Security Council to prioritize the humanitarian situation and facilitate Sudanese-led dialogue efforts.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrested as police raid royal homes over Epstein links
King Charles says authorities have his ‘wholehearted’ support and insists ‘law must take its course’ after his brother is arrested on his 66th birthday
- Bookmark
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday – his 66th birthday – and his homes at Sandringham and Berkshire were raided, over his links to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The former prince was held on suspicion of misconduct in public office over claims that he leaked sensitive documents to the disgraced financier while working as a UK trade envoy.
He was held for 11 hours in police custody while searches were undertaken at his Wood Farm property on the King’s estate in Norfolk as well as his former home, Royal Lodge, in Windsor.
Later, he was seen slouched in the back of a vehicle being driven away from Aylsham police station in Norfolk.
King Charles said that “the law must take its course” after expressing his “deepest concern” over the arrest of his brother, who was stripped of his royal titles last year.
Neither Buckingham Palace nor the King was informed of his arrest in advance, with both the monarch and Queen Camilla facing hecklers and questions from bystanders as they continued with their royal duties during a visit to London Fashion Week on Thursday.
The Prince and Princess of Wales have not publicly commented, but are understood to support the King’s statement.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, the first of a senior royal in modern history, comes after more than 15 years of scrutiny over his ties to Epstein, who died in a US prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
In response to his brother’s arrest, Charles said: “I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.
“What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.
“In this, as I have said before, they have our full and wholehearted support and co-operation. Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.”
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at his home after a convoy of police vehicles arrived at around 8am, before he was taken to be interviewed by officers.
The news of the former Duke of York’s arrest comes as pictures circulated online appearing to show unmarked police cars in attendance at Wood Farm, with plainclothes officers gathered outside the property.
In Windsor, vans carrying police officers were seen entering the gates of his former home, where a search is believed to be ongoing. Runners, dog walkers and children on scooters were still roaming the sprawling parks surrounding the residence, while reporters and photographers were held at an outer gate beyond Windsor Great Park and barred from entering.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is facing allegations that he shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy, which included forwarding confidential documents.
According to the Crown Prosecution Service’s (CPS) website, misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Confirming the probe, Oliver Wright, Thames Valley Police’s Assistant Chief Constable, said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.
“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
Before the arrest was announced, Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Breakfast that “nobody is above the law” when he was asked about Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
He added: “Anybody who has any information should testify. So whether it’s Andrew or anybody else, anybody who has got relevant information should come forward to whatever the relevant body is, in this particular case, we’re talking about Epstein, but there are plenty of other cases.”
Several police forces across the UK are assessing information released as part of the latest dump of Epstein files, including the Metropolitan Police and forces in Surrey, Bedfordshire, Essex, Norfolk, Wiltshire and the West Midlands.
Thames Valley Police has also said it is reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor. And on Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police said it was also looking into claims that the then Prince Andrew’s protection officers turned a “blind eye” to his visits to Epstein’s island, Little St James.
Responding to news of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, former prime minister Gordon Brown said he had submitted a five-page memorandum to UK police forces, including the Met, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley Police.
“This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women,” he said.
Mr Brown previously claimed that the Epstein files showed in “graphic detail” how the financier was able to use London Stansted airport to “fly in girls from Latvia, Lithuania and Russia”, and called for police to investigate.
Separately, Virginia Giuffre, who took her own life last year, alleged in a civil court case that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had sexually assaulted her. She claimed to have met the then prince while being trafficked by Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always vehemently denied the claims, but he paid millions to settle Giuffre’s civil case in 2022, despite insisting he had never met her.
Her family welcomed the news of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest, stating: “At last, today our broken hearts have been lifted with the news that no one is above the law – not even royalty.
“On behalf of our sister, we extend our gratitude to the UK’s Thames Valley Police in their investigation and arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He was never a prince. For survivors everywhere, Virginia did this for you.”
The King’s brother was stripped of both his prince title and his dukedom last year after it emerged that he had maintained his friendship with Epstein for longer than he had previously claimed.
He does, however, remain in the line of succession – he is eighth in line to the throne, having gradually moved down after being born second in line.
Removing someone from the line of succession is impossible without new legislation, but Labour MP Rachael Maskell and Conservative MP Chris Philp have called for a law change, saying the former duke should no longer be in line to the throne.

Faltering fighter jet deal casts doubt on European defense plans

Faltering fighter jet deal casts doubt on EU defense plans
February 19, 2026The simmering spat between France and Germany bubbled over publicly when German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Machtwechsel podcast that the collaboration to build a nuclear-capable fighter jet with France is "not what we currently need in the German military."
The project, known as the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), was launched in 2017 with then-Chancellor Angela Merkel and still-in-post French President Emmanuel Macron, but now looks in jeopardy.
Europe is scrambling to become a resurgent military force in its own right due to significantly diminished trust in the Trump administration's commitment to European defense. Germany pulling back from the FCAS project could be seen as a serious setback to progress.
"The Germans should not make the same mistake as the French did and isolate themselves from the rest of Europe," said Christian Mölling, director of the Berlin-based think tank, European Defence In a New Age (EDINA).
"The defense ramp up we are doing in Europe is primarily a national ramp up, but losing other Europeans politically is not the best way for the joint defense of Europe," said Mölling.
Reducing dependence on the US
Trump's threats to annex Greenland, his administration's wavering support for the NATO military alliance and Ukraine, and his trade tariffs, have caused a shift in atmosphere in Brussels and around EU capitals towards reducing dependence on the US, especially regarding military systems.
"That's why some of Merz's public comments are not so smart," said Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.
"What you don't want to do is give the impression that you will continue buying American equipment at all costs," said Wolff. "We need to shift away from US equipment, towards European equipment — I think most people have understood that by now."
The US had been concerned that the FCAS programme could result in EU countries halting purchases of American-made F35-fighter jet, but that fear hasn't materialized.
For Christian Mölling, the White House will take a clear lesson from the spat which has erupted between France and Germany on FCAS — "that you can split the Europeans," he told DW.
Both industry and governments clashing
The big sticking point between Paris and Berlin has been the involvement of French arms giant Dassault Aviation, which has demanded significantly more control over the project than the other industry partner, European consortium company, Airbus Space and Defence.
"In recent years, Macron has failed to convince Dassault Aviation not to be a hindrance — once again — to the success of a major European cooperative armament programme," Samuel Faure, an expert on European defense policy at Sciences Po, told DW.
"The pressure is much greater on the French head of state than on the German chancellor," said Faure. "France's budgetary situation is much more worrying than Germany's, and Germany now has a much larger military budget than France."
For Faure, different operational requirements, like France needing the jets to be capable of carrying its nuclear weapons, are not a reason to stop the project.
"This is never an insurmountable problem unless political leaders decide that it is," he said.
That was a position broadly echoed by the CEO of Airbus in a recent exclusive interview with DW.
"It's a danger that if you start on these big European projects, it takes more than political will," said Michael Schoellhorn, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space. "It takes the industrial alignment of the players involved."
EU defense projects unlikely to be harmed
Rearming Europe has not only been a priority for the two biggest economies of the continent but has also for all 27 members of the European Union, many of whom have legitimate concerns about their own safety following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The RearmEU proposal, rebranded as Readiness 2030," is the EU's flagship, €800 billion‑scale plan to boost defence spending, pool procurement, improve rapid deployment capabilities, solidify an industrial base for European defense companies, and to support Ukraine.
"But FCAS is deliberately not a European project," said Christian Mölling from EDINA. "If there is a spillover in terms of atmosphere, then possibly, yes, this situation could have an effect on the EU."
"I wouldn't be too afraid," said Mölling. "Nobody was waiting for FCAS to be the solution, the savior, or the avant garde of European defense industrial projects."
System clouds over system hardware
Despite the growing rancor between France and Germany, the general consensus from experts and observers is that while the hardware side of the deal could fall apart, the cloud system it's creating will likely remain on course.
"More important to the Germans than the fighter jet itself is the 'combat cloud', because, not only the French or the Germans, but the Europeans, have to lose something," said Mölling. "There we are also dependent on the US."
The FCAS agreement sets out work on an interlinked drone swarm and a cloud system which links the drones to jets in real-time.
"We need to invest so much more in intelligence — the software bit that connects it all," said Guntram Wolff. "And if that is staying as a really strong Franco-German project, then I think we are actually in very good territory in terms of European cooperation."

Airbus aims for record aircraft deliveries in 2026

Airbus announced a record net profit of €5.2 billion for the 2025 fiscal year on Thursday, February 19. This historic result is up by 23% compared to 2024. This far exceeded its previous record of €4.2 billion set in 2022. This increase in profits came despite Airbus missing its aircraft delivery targets in 2025. The company had originally planned to deliver 820 aircraft to its customers, but was only able to deliver 793, due to "quality issues" with A320 fuselage panels announced in December 2025. On Thursday, Airbus CEO Guillaume Fleury said, "2025 was a landmark year, characterized by very strong demand for our products and services across all businesses, a record financial performance and strategic milestones." This optimism was buoyed by a 6% rise in annual revenue, reaching €73.4 billion.
For 2026, Faury anticipated a further acceleration in production, forecasting record deliveries of 870 aircraft, surpassing the level reached in 2019 when Airbus delivered 863 planes to airlines and leasing companies. However, these projections would have been even higher if not for difficulties faced by some suppliers. "Global demand for commercial aircraft underpins our ongoing production ramp-up, which we are managing while facing significant Pratt & Whitney engine shortages," said the company's chief executive.

French prosecutor seeks murder charges over killing of far-right activist

A French prosecutor is seeking murder charges against seven suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger beyond France’s borders, prompting Emmanuel Macron to tell Italy’s Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on 12 February. Most of the 11 suspects who have been detained are from far-left movements.
The prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested murder charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any “disturbance to public order”.
The killing has fuelled political tensions before French municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally party is expected to have its best chance yet of winning the highest office.
On Wednesday, Meloni said the killing of Deranque was “a wound for all of Europe”.
Macron said there was no place in France “for movements that adopt and legitimise violence” and he called on all political parties to “clean up” their act. “Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic,” he said.
Macron also suggested that people should “stay in their own lane”, after Meloni lamented “a climate of ideological hatred”.
“I’m always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don’t want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what is happening elsewhere,” Macron said while on a visit to Delhi.
Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, hit back, saying the killing of the French activist was “a serious matter that concerns us all”. Tajani said on X that there had been similar incidents in Italy’s history and that condemning such violence aimed “to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past”.
He said there had been “many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the republic”.
Macron was “closely monitoring” events, a member of his team said on Thursday, adding: “We must avoid any spiral of violence.”
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing. Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two had refused to speak while in custody.
He said others acknowledged being at the scene and “some admit to having struck blows” but they had all disputed having had any homicidal intent. Four suspects had been released but more were being sought, he added.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphaël Arnault, a MP with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.
A lawyer for Deranque’s parents said they called “for calm and restraint”. “The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence,” Fabien Rajon told the broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron’s supporters and the left, including the hard left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far right from power. But after Deranque’s killing, some high-profile politicians have sought to distance themselves from the hard left, ruling out any possible future alliance.
The justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, called on Arnault to “draw the consequences” if the judiciary “finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired”.
LFI’s national coordinator, Manuel Bompard, said Arnault would “certainly not” be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the national assembly’s lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) that was co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

- President Trump has warned Iran that it must agree to curb its nuclear program within 10 days or “bad things will happen.”
- “Now we may have to take it a step further or we may not,” Trump told Board of Peace members Thursday at the first meeting of his new panel of world leaders. “You are going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
- Trump set the deadline after the US significantly bolstered its military presence in the Middle East, deploying a large number of warplanes and two aircraft carrier groups to the region.
- Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, responded by threatening that the US could be “struck so hard that it cannot get back up” if it renews attacks.
- Tehran has conducted naval drills, including closing the Strait of Hormuz and joint exercises with Russia, with earlier reports suggesting US forces could be ready to strike as early as Saturday.

Zelenskyy: We expect UNHCR Office to increase its support for Ukrainians
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with newly appointed UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Barham Salih, during which, among other things, the consequences of Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy grid and the necessary assistance were discussed.
"First of all, I sincerely thank you for your visit and for supporting our people during these difficult days and nights for Ukrainians. We greatly appreciate your support throughout this entire period. I hope we can count on its continuation," Zelenskyy said.
The President noted that Ukraine expects the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to increase support for Ukrainians forced to live under constant Russian attacks.
"They don't want to stop. We're trying to do everything we can at various levels of negotiations, relying on the support of our American partners. But we feel we need more pressure. And also more support for the morale of our people," Zelenskyy emphasized.
Salih, in turn, noted that he wanted to come to Ukraine at this particular time, in winter, to express solidarity with its people.
"We are proud to cooperate with you. UNHCR will continue and strengthen our support, complementing the emergency efforts of the authorities, and will do more to support resilient communities in the recovery process," he said.

Trump appears to set Iran deadline, as US deploys vast Middle East force: ‘10, 15 days’
The US deployment is unlike anything since the 2003 invasion of Iraq and dwarfs the build-up off Venezuela before Maduro’s ousting
The US military is stationing a vast array of forces in the Middle East, including two aircraft carriers, fighter jets and refuelling tankers, giving President Donald Trump the option for a major attack against Iran as he pressures the country to strike a deal over its nuclear programme.
The deployment is unlike anything the US has done since 2003, when it amassed forces ahead of the invasion of Iraq. It dwarfs the military build-up that Trump ordered off the coast of Venezuela in the weeks before he ousted President Nicolas Maduro.
While the US is not likely to deploy ground troops, the build-up suggests Trump is giving himself discretion to launch a sustained campaign lasting many days, in cooperation with Israel. It would look far different from the overnight strikes the US launched against Iran’s nuclear programme last June.
Trump warned Iran that it must reach a deal or “bad things” would happen and appeared to set a 10-day deadline before the US might take action.
“Maybe we’re going to make a deal,” Trump said in a speech on Thursday morning. “You’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
Speaking later to reporters on Air Force One, the president said: “I would think that would be enough time – 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”

No specific date set for Ukraine's accession to EU – Costa
The President of the European Council Antonio Costa stated this at a press conference in Oslo during his visit to Norway, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Costa said that EU enlargement is the most important geopolitical investment the European Union can make in the future of peace and stability in Europe, and that the EU is fully committed to the enlargement process regarding Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans.
He added that he is impressed by what Ukraine is doing during the war in terms of implementing reforms and adapting to European standards in order to become a member of the European Union.
Costa confirmed readiness to officially begin accession negotiations as soon as possible and to move forward in the enlargement process.
He said that he could not say whether Ukraine's accession would happen in 2027, 2026, or later, but emphasized that it is important not to lose momentum or the time and technical work Ukraine is carrying out.
A successful completion of Ukraine's EU accession process is important for stabilizing the country and ensuring prosperity for the Ukrainian people after the war, Costa added, recalling that in June 2022 the European Council decided to grant Ukraine candidate status for membership.
He said that since then, the EU has been working hard, and that it is very difficult and challenging for Ukraine to implement reforms while at war. Costa emphasized that all EU member states will strive to fulfill their commitments.
Regarding Hungary's resistance to Ukraine's progress in accession talks, Costa explained that the EU must deal every day with 27 member states because the Union is based on diversity. He noted that bilateral issues, particularly between Hungary and Ukraine, must be resolved, but reminded that Hungary had voted to grant Ukraine candidate status.
He noted that in negotiations, decisions sometimes require a great deal of time.
Costa recalled that his own country, Portugal, had waited nine years to be admitted to the European Union, and that Ukraine is now moving much faster. He expressed optimism that the EU will be able to achieve success very soon.
As reported, Ukraine's representative to the European Union, Vsevolod Chentsov, said in an interview with Ukrinform that Ukraine's phased accession to the European Union is not a compromise but a pragmatic tool intended to accelerate the country's integration and ensure quality preparation. He noted that the concept itself is not new and has been used in the past.

NABU, SAPO charge four more in case tied to ex-State Property Fund head
Law enforcement officers have notified four additional individuals of suspicion in the case of a criminal organization headed by former State Property Fund chief Dmytro Sennychenko; they are suspected of laundering corrupt proceeds totaling UAH 300 million.
"NABU and SAPO have issued new suspicions in the case of the criminal organization headed by the former head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine. This concerns four individuals involved in the legalization of property obtained through criminal means," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau said in a statement.
According to the report, to launder corrupt proceeds, the suspects created companies abroad and used them to purchase various assets. These included land plots in Croatia, expensive cars, and an entire floor of apartments in a residential building in the United Arab Emirates, among other things. The total value of the laundered property exceeds UAH 300 million.
The identification of new participants in the scheme became possible thanks to the work of a joint investigative team with several European countries.
As previously reported, according to investigators, the former SPFU head, together with accomplices, installed "their own" people as directors of PJSC Odesa Port Plant and PJSC United Mining and Chemical Company. These directors then signed contracts with pre-selected companies and sold products at artificially low prices. The price difference was siphoned off and converted for the benefit of the criminal organization. This caused state losses of more than UAH 700 million. Members of the criminal organization are also suspected of laundering over UAH 10 billion in criminal proceeds. The total number of suspects in the organization's activities now stands at 15.
In May 2024, the High Anti-Corruption Court arrested former SPFU head Sennychenko in absentia. Since April 2023, he has been on an international wanted list. In March 2023, NABU announced suspicion against Sennychenko.

Talarico and Crockett Test How to Convert Huge TikTok Followings Into Votes
Unknown

03:34:32 KST

Few politicians command audiences on TikTok large enough to rival traditional media outlets. But in the increasingly volatile Texas Senate race, two rising-star Democrats have built precisely that kind of reach, turning the platform into a central battleground in their primary contest.
Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett and State Representative James Talarico have TikTok followings that would be the envy of most national political figures. Crockett counts more than 2.4 million followers, placing her among the most followed members in Congress, behind just Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Talarico, a former middle school teacher from the Austin suburbs, is not far behind with more than 1.6 million followers on the platform.
Together, they have amassed the largest TikTok followings of any candidates in competitive statewide races this year, according to a TIME analysis, making the March 3 primary a test of which of their distinct approaches to leveraging viral attention will translate into electoral success in a state where Democrats have not won a Senate seat since 1988.
Crockett’s most watched TikTok lasts just five seconds. Filmed outside the Capitol, she delivers a profane dismissal of Elon Musk with a flicker of exasperation that feels calibrated for the scroll. “F—k off,” she says when asked what she would tell the former DOGE director. The clip from last February has been viewed more than 20 million times. One of Talarico’s most popular videos runs closer to a minute and a half. Standing at a lectern, he argues that “the biggest division in our politics is not left versus right, it’s top versus bottom,” casting inequality as a moral crisis. That video from last summer has drawn more than 15 million views.
The contrast is instructive. Crockett, 44, a former public defender who flipped a Dallas-area House seat in 2022, has fashioned herself into one of the Democratic Party’s most combative messengers. Her televised clashes with Republicans—including a now-famous exchange with former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in which Crockett mocked Greene’s “bleach-blonde, bad-built, butch body”—ricocheted across social media and landed her on late-night television. She speaks openly about doing “the edgy things” consultants warn candidates to avoid, arguing that in an era of attention scarcity, bluntness cuts through.
Talarico, 36, offers a different register. He is training to be a Presbyterian minister, and many of his viral moments have the cadence of sermons. He has invoked scripture to criticize conservative proposals and to frame economic inequality as a betrayal of Christian teaching. In one widely viewed video, he criticized lawmakers for advancing a bill requiring the Ten Commandments in classrooms while working on the Sabbath, quipping that they should try following the commandments before mandating them.
Where Crockett’s videos often feel like a punchline delivered with precision timing, Talarico’s resemble closing arguments, carefully paced and morally freighted. Party veterans describe the online spectacle as both exhilarating and unnerving. The reach that once would have required a television buy across Texas’ 19 media markets can now be achieved with a well-timed clip.
TikTok Drama
The rise of candidates like Crockett and Talarico reflects a broader shift in how Americans encounter politics. A September Pew study found that more than half of adults now consume news on social media, and research from Johns Hopkins found that nearly three-quarters of Gen Z Americans say social platforms are their primary news source.
In Texas, that shift has produced an unexpected consequence: the loudest clashes in the Democratic primary have not been between Crockett and Talarico, but among the sprawling ecosystem of creators on TikTok and other platforms who have turned the race into a proxy battleground. Both campaigns recently found themselves consumed by whether Talarico had described former Democratic Senate nominee Colin Allred as a “mediocre Black man.” The allegation began with an interaction with a TikTok influencer and quickly metastasized into days of online recrimination. Talarico has said he had been misquoted and taken out of context.
Kyle Tharp, who closely follows the intersection of politics and online influencers and writes the left-leaning newsletter Chaotic Era, says the Texas race offers a revealing snapshot of a rapidly maturing “political influencer class.”
In recent weeks, he adds, online discourse surrounding the Texas primary has been “defined by drama between political creators,” many of whom publicly feud, criticize rival candidates, and amplify accusations originating far from the campaigns’ official operations.
Both campaigns have sought to cultivate relationships with creators by offering access to events or messaging, even as the financial relationships behind some online advocacy remain opaque. “We have no idea who is being paid by what campaign or affiliated PACs or groups,” Tharp says, describing what he called an emerging “undisclosed creator payment ecosystem.”
The Talarico campaign declined to comment for this story. The Crockett campaign did not respond to a request for comment, though a spokesperson previously told the Texas Tribune that her campaign does not pay for any content creators.
“If you think this is messy,” Tharp added, “just wait until there’s 30 Democrats running for president all trying to secretly pay these influencers to fight each other on their behalf.”
Polling suggests that TikTok is more than just a sideshow in the race. A recent survey from Texas Public Opinion Research found that 47% of likely Democratic primary voters said they had recently seen or heard from Crockett on social media; 35% said the same of Talarico. Digital platforms were the leading source of exposure for both candidates, outpacing cable and broadcast news. In a state with chronically low turnout and a large population of younger, less consistent voters, that kind of visibility is no small asset, says Luke Warford, a Democratic strategist who leads a political action committee focused on turning Texas blue and separately runs the Texas Public Opinion Research.
“The two things that candidates most need to do to be effective in 2026 is get attention and raise money,” says Warford. “Talarico and Crockett are two of the most effective TikTok communicators in the country and they've both been able to translate their ability to get attention on TikTok into really strong fundraising.”
A Colbert Bump
The primary fight between the two Texas Democrats has been among the most closely watched of the midterms thus far, becoming a national story this week after TV host Stephen Colbert alleged CBS blocked him from airing his interview with Talarico, a charge CBS has denied. The ensuing drama has drawn millions of viewers to the interview segment on YouTube, and has spurred a fundraising boom for Talarico. A clip of the interview Talarico posted on TikTok received more than 1 million views.
Yet polls show the race is either tied, or Crockett is several points ahead. Asked who is more likely to energize the Democratic base, voters give Crockett the edge according to most polling data. But when asked who is better positioned to appeal to the broader coalition needed to win statewide in November, Talarico holds a slight advantage. The primary, in effect, has become a referendum on two competing theories of Democratic revival in Texas: mobilization versus persuasion.
Crockett has embraced a turnout argument, contending that Texas is less a red state than a low-participation one, and that inspiring infrequent voters—particularly voters of color—is the key to breaking the Republican hold on statewide offices. Critics counter that past statements like her calling conservatives “inherently violent” and saying Latino Trump supporters have a “slave mentality,” will make for easy and effective attack ads in the fall.
“Our goal is to make sure that we can engage people that historically have not been talked to, because there’s so many people that get ignored, specifically in the state of Texas,” Crockett told CNN, adding that her strategy is to appeal to people who “vote for who they believe is fighting for them.”
Talarico argues that Democrats must broaden their appeal in a culturally conservative state. His religious language is not incidental but strategic, an attempt to compete on moral terrain that Republicans have long attempted to dominate.
The general election landscape adds another layer of unpredictability. Republicans are engaged in their own bruising contest between incumbent Senator John Cornyn, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Congressman Wesley Hunt. Democrats see an opening, as they have before. Yet history weighs heavily: no Democrat has won a statewide federal race in Texas in more than three decades.
The unanswered question hanging over the race is whether cultural prominence can be alchemized into durable political power. A TikTok following may signal authenticity, charisma or anger at the status quo. It does not, on its own, build a turnout operation across a state with 254 counties.
“Every data point we get suggests that 2026 is going to be some sort of wave year,” Warford says. “The biggest question is: How big of a wave? What you're seeing on TikTok is that people are fighting this hard because they actually think that whoever becomes the nominee might have a shot of winning in November.”

Issuance by Russia of license to operate power unit No. 2 of Zaporizhia NPP has no legal basis – Greenpeace Ukraine

Issuance by Russia of license to operate power unit No. 2 of Zaporizhia NPP has no legal basis – Greenpeace Ukraine
The issuance by the Russian nuclear regulator Rostekhnadzor of a license to operate power unit No. 2 of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has no legal basis either in Ukraine or in international jurisdiction, Greenpeace Ukraine believes.
According to the organization's release Thursday, Rostekhnadzor, like Rosatom, is a criminal organization, and the signing of a license for a facility that has been under occupation for nearly four years and where reactor maintenance has been destroyed has no safety justification. Earlier, on December 23, 2025, Rostekhnadzor had already issued a similar illegal license for Unit No. 1 of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant.
"The idea that Russia has any right to issue an operational license for Ukraine’s nuclear plant at Enerhodar is outrageous. But is not surprising given the scale of their criminal operations at the plant since 2022," said Shaun Burnie, senior nuclear specialist of Greenpeace Ukraine.
According to a new satellite study conducted in 2025 by McKenzie Intelligence Services (MIS) on behalf of Greenpeace Ukraine, systematic militarization and disregard for nuclear safety principles have been documented at the plant. In particular, satellite analysis showed that the surface area of the cooling pond decreased by more than 100,000 square meters during the summer of 2025.
Greenpeace Ukraine added that new fortified military positions and anti-drone structures have also appeared around the facility.
The organization noted that the issuance of an operating license does not mean the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant's reactors face an immediate threat of restart. The term "operating license" refers to the reactors in their current mode, which since 2022 has primarily been a "cold shutdown" state.
Additionally, Rosatom has declared its illegal intention to restart the reactors. However, the scale of safety concerns at the plant is extraordinary.
"This is also a further example of the dangerous nuclear disinformation campaign by Rosatom to try and convince the world that all is proceeding as normal at the plant... There is nothing normal about a full scale military occupation of Europe’s largest nuclear plant," said Jan Vande Putte of Greenpeace Ukraine.
He also noted that since 2022, torture and intimidation of Ukrainians by Russian forces, facilitated by Rosatom, have been widely employed on the grounds of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, and that the plant itself is being used as a military platform for attacks on and killings of Ukrainian civilians in Nikopol and other regions of Ukraine.
As previously reported, during negotiations in early February, Moscow rejected a U.S. proposal, put forward as part of a peace deal, for full American control over the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, which would have given the United States the right to distribute the plant's energy between Ukraine and Russia.

Moldovan gas reserves almost used up, 8 mcm remains
Moldova's gas reserves for the current heating season decreased from 101.2 million cubic meters (mcm) on November 1, 2025 to 7.8 mcm on February 18, CEO of state-owned company Energocom Eugeniu Buzatu said at a meeting of Moldova's parliament.
"As of February 18, 2026, the remainder of the gas reserve decreased to 83,400 MWh or around 7.84 mcm, showing a drastic decline since the beginning of the cold season," Buzatu is quoted as saying by the bani.md publication.
He said that 13.6 mcm had been taken from gas storage facilities in November, 14.24 mcm in December, 41.6 mcm in January and 24 mcm from February 1 to February 18.
Moldova keeps gas reserves in underground storage facilities in Ukraine and Romania.
In November, Moldovan Energy Minister Dorin Junghietu said that Energocom had signed contracts to have over 700 mcm of gas delivered during the heating season. According to data from Energocom, the gas is acquired with firm delivery in the corresponding month of consumption and is bought at both fixed and indexed prices, which are correlated with the quotations of the main stock exchanges in Central and Southeastern Europe - TTF (Title Transfer Facility) in the Netherlands and BRM (Romanian Commodity Exchange) in Romania.
Moldova consumes 0.8-0.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas each year.

Hamas condemned the Palestinian Authority after security forces conducted an arrest operation in the West Bank that led to the accidental death of two children, aged 16 and four, this week.
Hamas cited the incident as a reason to end security coordination with Israel, describing it as a “serious crime” and a “black mark” on the PA’s record, saying the establishment “used force against their own people instead of protecting them”.
Palestinian media, citing the family, reported that PA masked officers waited at a junction for 44-year-old Samer Samara to drive by before opening fire in the direction of his car, where he was driving his children.
It is unclear who Samara was wanted by
After the incident, the PA expressed “deep regret” for the event, saying the two were shot dead during an operation to arrest their father in Tubas.
While the PA confirmed Samara was a wanted individual, it is unclear what his crimes were, though Palestinian reports claimed he had ties to Islamic Jihad and had been arrested by Israeli forces several times.
Samara's family released a statement demanding that he be released immediately and that those responsible for the killings be held accountable.

This is what Donald Trump asked world leaders whilst standing on stage for a photo opportunity at his inaugural Board of Peace meeting.
On Thursday (19 February), delegates from nearly 50 countries gathered for the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington. Twenty-seven of the countries have joined the board, whilst the others came as observers.
As members gathered on stage for a picture, Guns N’ Roses’ “November Rain” played. “Does everybody like the music?” he asked, which was met with nods and approval. “It’s good music,” he said.
Guns N’ Roses has repeatedly voiced their opposition to the Trump administration using their music as part of their campaign.

Israeli FM Sa'ar honors fallen IDF soldiers, thanks Trump for Board of Peace

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar recalled the sacrifice of the 925 IDF soldiers killed in the Israel-Hamas war in his speech to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace at its inaugural meeting in Washington, DC, on Thursday.
Trump gave the first address at the meeting, followed by several officials from participating countries, including Israeli FM Sa'ar.
"As I stand here," Sa'ar said, "I recall the 925 brave soldiers that gave their lives in a war against pure evil: Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. These are the best people."
"They went from front to front and charged forward under enemy fire," the foreign minister added," To them we owe our existence and all our achievements. They will not be forgotten."
Sa'ar was highly complimentary toward President Trump for spearheading the peace initiative in Gaza.
"President Trump," he said, "This is an important day. Your historic actions have proven time and again: You are a leader who takes initiative, forges new paths, and works toward a better future for the entire world."
Sa'ar's statements covered the atrocities of October 7 and the ensuing war, and the steps that Trump, Israel, and the BoP plan to take toward imminent peace, emphasizing disarmament of Hamas and de-radicalization of the Gazan Palestinian population.
"The infrastructure that indoctrinates Palestinian children to hate and kill Jews - in educational and religious institutions - should no longer exist," he said.
The foreign minister ended his speech expressing gratitude toward President Trump. "President Trump’s visionary leadership creates, for the first time, an opportunity for a better future," he said.
On behalf of Israel, I say: Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership."
Trump presides over Board of Peace,
Trump's International Board of Peace, which is meant to supervise Gaza's transitional governance, held its inaugural meeting in Washington on Thursday.
Trump told the first meeting of his Board of Peace on Thursday that nations had contributed $7 billion to a Gaza reconstruction fund that aims to rebuild the enclave once Hamas disarms.
Hamas previously said it is ready to hand over administration of the enclave to a US-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats headed by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority official in the occupied West Bank. But it says Israel has not yet allowed committee members to enter Gaza to assume their responsibilities.
The appointment of Shaath's committee in January marked the start of the next phase of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, even as key elements of the first phase - including a complete cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas - remain unfulfilled.
The meeting in Washington came amid a broader push by Trump to build a reputation as a peacemaker in hopes of winning the Nobel Peace Prize. It also took place as the United States threatens war against Iran and has embarked on a massive military buildup in the region in case Tehran refuses to give up its nuclear program.

Uganda to build statue in memory of Yoni Netanyahu at site of daring hostage rescue - report

Uganda will soon build a statue honoring Lt.-Col. Yonatan “Yoni” Netanyahu at Entebbe International Airport, Uganda’s Chief of Defence Forces, Gen. Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a Thursday post on X, at what he described as the exact spot where Netanyahu was killed during the 1976 hostage rescue operation.
Kainerugaba, the son of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, framed the proposed monument as a symbol of ties between Uganda and Israel. He did not provide a date for an unveiling, and no formal Ugandan government announcement was immediately available.
Netanyahu, the older brother of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was the only Israeli soldier killed in the raid, which freed Jewish hostages held at Entebbe after the hijacking of an Air France flight in 1976.
In Israel, the Entebbe operation remains a defining moment in national memory, and Yoni Netanyahu’s role and sacrifice to ensure the mission's success are an integral part of the story.
Israeli officials have previously marked Entebbe anniversaries in Uganda, including Prime Minister Netanyahu’s 2016 visit to a memorial ceremony at the airport and his public remarks there.
The proposed statue, if advanced, would come against that backdrop of longstanding Israeli commemoration of the raid and periodic diplomatic engagement with Uganda around the anniversary.

Air France Flight 139, the plane at the center of the 1976 Entebbe hijacking, was seized by four hijackers, two Palestinians affiliated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, External Operations (PFLP-EO), and two Germans from the Revolutionary Cells. The attackers are widely identified as Wilfried Böse and Brigitte Kuhlmann of the Revolutionary Cells, along with Fayez Abdul-Rahim al-Jaber and Jayel (also reported as Jael or Jalil) al-Arja from the PFLP-EO.
There, the hijackers separated roughly 100 Jewish and Israeli hostages from other passengers and demanded the release of dozens of prisoners, before Israeli forces launched the long-range rescue on July 4, flying about 4,000 km to Entebbe and freeing almost all the hostages in a raid that lasted less than 90 minutes.

West Virginia sues Apple over iCloud's alleged role in distributing child sex abuse material

The office of West Virginia's attorney general said it has filed a lawsuit accusing Apple of allowing its iCloud service to become what the company's internal communications described as the "greatest platform for distributing child porn."
Attorney General JB McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing user privacy over child safety, his office said in a statement on Thursday. It is called the first of its kind by a government agency over the distribution of child sexual abuse material on Apple's data storage platform.
Apple has previously denied wrongdoing in a lawsuit by private plaintiffs making similar claims.
The company has considered scanning images but abandoned the approach due to concerns about user privacy and safety, including worries that it could be exploited by governments seeking other material for censorship or arrest, Reuters has reported.
"These images are a permanent record of a child's trauma, and that child is revictimized every time the material is shared or viewed," McCuskey said in the statement. "This conduct is despicable, and Apple's inaction is inexcusable."
His office cited a text message Apple's then anti-fraud chief sent in 2020 stating that because of Apple's priorities, it was "the greatest platform for distributing child porn."
The state said it is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and that the lawsuit filed in Mason County Circuit Court asks a judge to order Apple to implement more effective measures to detect abusive material and to adopt safer product designs.
Alphabet's Google, Microsoft, and other platform providers check uploaded photos or emailed attachments against a database of identifiers of known child sex abuse material provided by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other clearing houses.
Until 2022, Apple took a different approach. It did not scan all files uploaded to its iCloud storage offerings, and the data was not end-to-end encrypted, meaning law enforcement officials could access it with a warrant.
Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple planned to implement end-to-end encryption for iCloud, which would have rendered data unusable by law enforcement officials. It abandoned the plan after the FBI complained it would harm investigations.
Implementing Communication Safety to blur nudity
In August 2021, Apple announced NeuralHash, designed to balance child abuse material detection with privacy by scanning images on users' devices before upload.
The system was criticized by security researchers who worried it could yield false reports of abusive material, and it sparked a backlash from privacy advocates who claimed it could be expanded to permit government surveillance.
A month later, Apple delayed the introduction of NeuralHash before canceling it in December 2022, the state said in its statement. That same month, Apple launched end-to-end encryption for iCloud data.
The state said NeuralHash was inferior to other tools and could be easily evaded. It said Apple stores and synchronizes data through iCloud without proactive abuse material detection, allowing such images to circulate.
While Apple did not go through with the effort to scan images being uploaded to iCloud, it did implement a feature called Communication Safety that blurs nudity and other sensitive content being sent to or from a child's device.
Federal law requires US-based technology companies to report abuse material to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Apple in 2023 made 267 reports, compared to 1.47 million by Google and 30.6 million by Meta Platforms, the state said.
The state's claims mirror allegations in a proposed class action lawsuit filed against Apple in late 2024 in federal court in California by individuals depicted in such images.
Apple has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, saying the firm is shielded from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that provides broad protections to internet companies from lawsuits over content generated by users.

Rachael Maza on sisterhood, truth-telling and new play Black Light
Unknown

03:30:00 KST

Sisters Lisa and Rachael Maza reunite on stage for the world premiere of Black Light
The first day of rehearsal is always the best and worst day of the creative process for Rachael Maza.
"It's the first time you hear your voice out loud, and the entire theatre company's there watching," she tells ABC Radio National's Awaye.
"But it's also super exciting because you're beginning this massive journey."
The Yidinji/Meriam/Dutch actor — who recently stepped away from renowned Indigenous theatre company Ilbijerri after 18 years as artistic director — was especially excited to start rehearsing Black Light, which opened at Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre this week.
It's the first time Maza has shared the stage with her younger sister Lisa since the play they co-wrote wrapped in late 2009. And, just as they did in Sisters of Gelam, the pair are playing sisters.
Black Light follows four women — Bub, Mum, Aunty and Nan — who are stuck in a family home on the outskirts of Darwin, waiting out what seems to be a natural disaster.
Rachael and Lisa have taken on the roles of Aunty (Rachael) and Mum (Lisa), who bicker over everything from groceries to caring responsibilities for their mother (Trisha Moreton-Thomas; Kangaroo).
For Maza, having the chance to work with her sister on a new show has been "pretty cool".
"There's a real familiarity that means that we can just get on with the work," Maza says.
And that work never stops.
"Even over lunch, we're still talking about it. And when we go home we're still talking about it."
Parallel careers
Maza says she has an "incredible, easy relationship" with Lisa — something she in part credits to their shared love of music and live performance as teenagers.
"There was a moment, a really distinct turning point in our kind of fractious relationship as siblings, where suddenly Lisa and I really honed in and became best buddies and really shared a lot of interests when we started going out and seeing bands," she says.
"We definitely have our moments but it's great. It's so easy. We kind of can finish each other's sentences. It's a classic sibling relationship. We just know each other so well."
The sisters each have stage and screen acting credits stretching back to the 90s.
Both have starred in productions of beloved family drama Radiance (Rachael in 1993 and Lisa in 1997), the seminal Stolen Generations play Stolen (Rachael in 2003-4 and Lisa in 1999 and 2002), and hit Indigenous musical The Sapphires (Rachael in 2005 and Lisa in 2011).
They've also sung together for most of their lives.
First, at the behest of their late father who would play guitar and encourage them to sing along. Later, they formed the Maza Sisters and performed at a number of festivals and events including the 150th anniversary of the National Gallery of Victoria in 2011 and the Dreaming Festival in 2009.
That same year, their play Sisters of Gelam brought together cabaret, puppetry, dance and spoken word to tell the story of two sisters who decide to journey together to their grandfather's Country on Mer (Murray Island) in the Torres Strait.
"Working together [on Black Light] is just a kind of continuation of that closeness that we've had since we first started going out and seeing bands together [as teenagers]," Maza explains.
Their closeness allows the Maza sisters to bring some real fire to their characters' squabbles in Black Light.
"We can just bust out screaming at each other and there's no 'I hope you didn't take that the wrong way'," Maza says.
"There's none of that because we know who we are, we know our relationship and we know we're acting."
'Poetically bold'
There's plenty for Maza to sink her teeth into in Black Light.
Written and directed by critically acclaimed playwright Jada Alberts (Brothers Wreck), the show doesn't just explore the lived experience of Blak sisterhood but also honours Blak motherhood.
"Women are the pillars and the centre of our families, the pillar and the centre and the anchor of our communities," Maza says.
Loading..."And it's a theme that we as Blakfullas particularly gravitate towards and we can all relate to it."
The experiences of three generations of Blak women are represented in the play, as well as their sometimes complicated relationships to one another.
While those experiences and relationships resonate deeply with Maza, they're brought to life on stage in new and inventive ways.
"[The play is] really quite poetically bold in its form," she says.
That's best demonstrated by the character of Nan.
At times, Nan seems to represent the loss of language and cultural knowledge, yet at others, she steps out of her wheelchair and becomes "the deep, timeless placeholder of knowledge".
"Jada really gives us full access, so, it becomes incredibly powerful, incredibly beautiful," Maza says.
"It's like those experiences that you have of Country, for instance, and you can't find the words for it but you feel it in every cell of your being."
Maza reckons the almost magical realist style in Black Light is a step forward for Blak theatre, from the early days of "naturalistically telling our stories with truth-telling at its core" to pushing against the boundaries of form.
"It's really, really incredible and very intentional what [Alberts] is exploring within this work," she says.
Change better than a holiday
Returning to the stage in such an ambitious work is a thrill for Maza.
It comes just two months after she stepped away from Ilbijierri. While some might have expected Maza to take a break after handing the reins to new artistic director Andrea James, that isn't her style.
"Not being an artistic director and just being an actor actually is a holiday," Maza says. "[It's] an opportunity to just go into my actor bubble and explore.
"The world of an artistic director is you've constantly got 12 things on the go and looking after a team of people. To suddenly not have to be thinking about that is like a holiday.
"And look, to be honest, I couldn't think of anything worse than lying on a beach. That would just bore me."
Black Light is at Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, until March 7.

Timeline of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s scandals as royal arrested on his birthday amid Epstein allegations
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has seen his reputation damaged over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein
- Bookmark
Widely purported to have been the late Queen’s “favourite” child, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has suffered a sharp fall from grace over the past decade.
Plagued by a string of controversies, the latest blow has seen him arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office following allegations he shared sensitive information with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Thames Valley Police confirmed the arrest on Thursday following claims made against the former prince after the release of millions of pages of files related to Epstein, which included messages between the two sent months after Mr Mountbatten-Windsor claimed to have ended his friendship with the convicted sex offender.
The arrest comes as pictures circulated online appearing to show unmarked police cars attending Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, with plain-clothed officers gathering outside Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s home on his 66th birthday.
Thames Valley Police previously said the force was also reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor. The King’s brother has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Emails between Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein reportedly show that he and Epstein were still exchanging messages until at least late February 2011, when the duke wrote: “Keep in close touch, and we’ll play some more soon.”
As a result, he was stripped of his remaining royal titles in October and was forced to leave his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, to relocate to a smaller privately funded address in Sandringham.
With the release of the so-called Epstein files and Virginia Giuffre’s posthumous memoir, his relationship with the financier, who took his own life in 2019, has increasingly made its way into the headlines.
In her book, Giuffre claims that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor considered it his “birthright” to sleep with her when she was 17 years old. While recognising that Giuffre may well be a victim of abuse by Epstein, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied her allegations against him.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s ties to the convicted paedophile eventually forced him to step down from his royal duties, and in January 2022, he was stripped of his royal patronages.
In the years since, he has faced a number of other scandals, including a “close confidante” of his being banned from the UK over allegations he was a Chinese spy.
Here, The Independent takes a look at a timeline of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s fall from grace and his retreat from the public eye.
Queen’s favourite
The Queen stood by Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s side even when he was caught up in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal in 2019 and “stepped back from royal duties for the foreseeable future”.
In October 2021, it was claimed that the monarch intended to spend millions of pounds privately funding her son’s defence against allegations of sexual abuse made by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.
She also signalled her support for her disgraced son by arriving alongside him for Prince Philip’s memorial service in March 2021.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor provided a steady arm for the Queen as she walked into Westminster Abbey to remember the life of her husband, just a few weeks after he reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement with Giuffre.
Friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
During his 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he had known British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the daughter of media magnate and former MP Robert Maxwell, since she was at university.
She introduced Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to her then-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein in 1999. The trio enjoyed a close friendship, even after Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute in 2008.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is alleged to have personally invited the couple to Balmoral, the Queen’s Scottish residence, in 1999.
Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022 following a New York sex-trafficking trial for procuring teen girls for Epstein to abuse.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor continued to visit Epstein in New York after the financier’s conviction for child sex offences in 2008.
Epstein received an 18-month sentence but was allowed to go on “work release” to his office most days and was released on probation after 13 months.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor faced criticism when pictures emerged which showed him opening the door of Epstein’s palatial East Side townhouse in December 2010 and the pair strolling through Central Park.
In the now-infamous 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, the royal claimed he had cut contact with Epstein in December 2010.
2011: Steps down as trade envoy
After facing severe criticism for his continued association with Epstein, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor agrees to step down as trade envoy with Buckingham Palace confirming he would only support businesses in the UK.
Pictures of him in New York with Epstein had placed intense pressure on the royals, with the former prince acknowledging he had made a mistake in visiting the convicted paedophile.
It was the latest in a string of controversies that plagued his tenure as trade envoy, which included criticism over his use of private jets and his links with unsavoury foreign dictators and business leaders.
2015: Virgina Giuffre allegations emerge
In April 2015, allegations emerged in court documents filed in Florida that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had sexual intercourse with Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 years old.
Both Buckingham Palace and Mr Mountbatten-Windsor strenuously deny the allegations.
2019: Virginia Giuffre sex abuse case
In 2019, Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan alleging she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor on three occasions when she was 17 and a minor under US law.
Giuffre has accused Mr Mountbatten-Windsor of sexually abusing her on Epstein’s private island, Little St James, as a teenager, which the former prince “unequivocally” denied.
2019: BBC Newsnight interview
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was criticised for a car crash BBC Newsnight interview that aired on 16 November 2019.
During the interview, he denied he slept with Giuffre, saying an encounter could not have taken place because he was at a branch of Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter Princess Beatrice.
He also said Giuffre’s claim he was sweaty at a nightclub was untrue because an “overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war” had left him unable to sweat.
The royal faced a public backlash, with equality campaigners claiming he was “too stupid to even pretend concern for Epstein’s victims”.
2019: Step back from public duties
Four days later, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor announced the Queen had given him permission to step back from public duties in the wake of the interview.
He said it had become clear to him in recent days that his association with Epstein had become a “major distraction” to the royal family’s work.
The royal said he regretted his association with Epstein and “deeply sympathises” with his victims.
2022: Stripped of royal titles and military affiliations
In January 2022, the Queen stripped Mr Mountbatten-Windsor of his military titles and royal patronages in the wake of a US judge allowing Giuffre’s civil sexual abuse case against her son to move to trial.
The former prince stopped using his HRH (His Royal Highness) style his roles – including Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, one of the oldest regiments in the British army – were handed to other members of the royal family.
His other military titles included honorary air commodore of RAF Lossiemouth; colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment; colonel-in-chief of the Small Arms School Corps; commodore-in-chief of the Fleet Air Arm; royal colonel of the Royal Highland Fusiliers; deputy colonel-in-chief of The Royal Lancers (Queen Elizabeth’s Own); and royal colonel of the Royal Regiment of Scotland.
2022: Out-of-court settlement
In March 2022, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor paid Giuffre a multi-million-pound out-of-court settlement, meaning both sides avoided the case going to trial.
As part of the agreement, he was due to pay damages to Giuffre and a donation to a charity “in support of victims’ rights”.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced calls to confirm how he funded settlement – which is reported to be as much as £12m – and whether the Queen or even King Charles, then Prince of Wales, contributed to the sum.
December 2024: ‘Confidante’ banned from UK over Chinese spy allegations
In December 2024, it emerged that a “close confidante” of the royal had been barred from entering the UK because authorities felt he was likely to pose a threat to national security.
Yang Tengbo brought a case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after the then-home secretary Suella Braverman said he should be excluded from the UK in March 2023.
British authorities allege the businessman was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.
He is said to have twice visited the royal residence at the invitation of the King’s younger brother and was described as a “close confidante” of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor insists he “ceased all contact” with the businessman accused of being a Chinese spy when concerns were first raised about him. He met the individual through “official channels” and “nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed”, a statement from his office said.
January 2025: New messages reveal ties with Epstein continued for months after New York visit
Newly surfaced messages revealed the Duke of York remained in contact with Epstein until February 2011 – despite having claimed to have cut him off in December 2010.
Emails between Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Epstein reportedly show they were still exchanging messages until at least late February 2011, when the duke wrote: “Keep in close touch and we’ll play some more soon.”
Messages were exchanged between the pair on the same day a photograph of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor with 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell – who is currently behind bars for recruiting and trafficking underage girls for Epstein – was published, Bloomberg reports.
The emails were obtained by Bloomberg after being disclosed in a filing by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), defending an appeal by former Barclays boss, Jes Staley, who is challenging its decision to ban him from the finance industry for misleading regulators on his ties to Epstein.
October 2025: Mr Mountbatten-Windsor forced to renounce Duke of York title
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor is forced to relinquish all his titles, including the Duke of York and Knight of the Garter as his former friendship with Epstein threatens to overshadow the work of the royal family.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has given up his title as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and his Garter role as a Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.
He released a statement saying that he, the King, and his family “have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the royal family”.
He continued: “I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life”.
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s former wife, Sarah Ferguson, will also no longer be known as the Duchess of York. Their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, will be unaffected.
The news came after the publication of extracts of the posthumous memoir of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre. In the book, Giuffre claimed that Mr Mountbatten-Windsor considered it his “birthright” to sleep with her.
In his statement, issued on 17 October, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor repeated that “I vigorously deny the accusations against me”.
December 2025: New photos released in connection with Epstein
Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was pictured in a set of images released from the Epstein estate released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. They also included images of US President Donald Trump, and Steve Bannon. It’s not clear when the photos were taken, as they are undated. No captions or context have been provided for any of the images.
Of the 19 photos shared by the Democrats, there is only one photo of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor where he stands with Microsoft magnate and philanthropist Bill Gates during the Malaria Summit in London in 2018.
Epstein is not featured in the image, which appears to be a cropped version of a professionally taken-photograph, which excludes the then-Prince Charles, who was also in frame. It remains unclear why the photo was part of Epstein's estate. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s appearance in the photo is not an indication of wrongdoing.
More personal photos saw Epstein with director Woody Allen and Virgin magnate Sir Richard Branson. Sir Richard and many other people photographed with Epstein have denied any wrongdoing in their association with the disgraced financier.
January 2026: Images show former prince kneeling over woman
New pictures from another tranche of Epstein files brought further scrutiny upon the King’s brother, with one showing him crouched over a woman as she lay on the floor.
In the undated images, the royal appears to kneel on the ground as he leans over an unidentified woman, while another angle shows the woman’s abdomen being touched.
Emails also appear to suggest he invited the sex offender for dinner at Buckingham Palace and agreed to meet a “beautiful” 26-year-old Russian woman.
February 2026: Mr Mountbatten-Windsor arrested
On his 66th birthday, the former prince was arrested by Thames Valley Police officers at his new home in Sandringham, on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The force previously said it was reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, as well as claims he shared sensitive information with the paedophile while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.
Searches are being carried out at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk, the force said.
Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.
“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”

The Epstein files arrest of former ‘Prince’ Andrew makes Trump’s Justice Department look pathetic
The British police have taken action. Where on Earth is Pam Bondi’s DOJ? asks Holly Baxter
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
On Thursday, America woke up to the news that Andrew (the artist formerly known as Prince) had been arrested over serious allegations made in the Epstein files. And you know what? It felt good.
There has been much consternation in the U.K. about the fact that Andrew’s “punishment” for alleged bad behavior looked very much like being handed a fancy free house and a lavishly funded retirement in obscurity. If that’s what you get for being a creep, then you might find a lot of similarly sweatless men lining up to be publicly “shamed” for their past misgivings.
The fact that the ex-royal has now been formally arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office looks like a big PR win for the embattled U.K. Because, given the same access to the same documents as the U.S., British police actually did something. King Charles’ response to his brother being taken into custody — that “the law must take its course” — was similarly indicative of actually letting something be done. If you squint, it all looks very open and sensible and upstanding.
Obviously, if you stop squinting and think about the whole “pedophile island visited regularly by international elites” thing, it all starts to look a bit less shiny.
And now let’s take a look at the other side of the Atlantic, where I currently sit: the side where Donald Trump — mentioned multiple times in the Epstein files, famously pictured partying with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, though he denies wrongdoing and claims that he cut ties with the sex trafficker pedophiles who were his former friends long before Epstein’s first conviction in 2008 — says it’s “really time” for us to all move on.
Because yes, there are a lot of emails, a lot of photographs. There are lots of claims, many salacious and unfounded. There are also a whole load of redactions. Of course, of course, it’s clear some bad stuff happened. But didn’t a couple of people resign from a couple of posts at a couple of universities? Anyway, have you heard about the Board of Peace?
The problem is that when you make the Epstein files a central part of your election strategy, it’s hard to shrug your shoulders and say, “that’s all, folks” as soon as they actually get released. Despite some truly shocking claims — that there may have been children as young as 9 years old, perhaps even younger, who were trafficked by Epstein and his associates; that there was a “torture video” shared among them; that Epstein and Maxwell paid their victims to recruit their friends into the trafficking network — there has been very little action by the DOJ.
In fact, it’s unclear whether the Justice Department has even looked closely enough at the tranche of files to know the basic specifics. Attorney General Pam Bondi erroneously claimed that all the files had been released just days ago. She also refused to acknowledge the victims at a congressional hearing who said they had been unable to meet with her Justice Department thus far, shrugging the claim off as “theatrics.”
Bondi’s reaction followed a now-familiar script: claim a “Democrat” witch hunt, refuse to mention the victims, immediately deflect into whataboutism. But loudly asking why the previous administration did nothing doesn’t count as action. It gets old quickly.
We have now seen releases of FBI files and heard the shock and horror of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. We, the American public, have access to a lot of the emails but lawmakers have seen even more of them behind closed doors. We have heard from the U.N. itself that some of these allegations amount to crimes against humanity.
So where are the arrests? Where is the crack team poring over every single date and word in order to hold as many people as possible to account? Where are the back-to-back, day-and-night meetings with the victims to gather every single possible morsel of data, to piece together a constellation of crimes so that the perpetrators may be held to account? Where is the DOJ? And why, oh why does justice in America these days look like a bunch of millionaires stepping down from their very prestigious jobs?
As yet, we are waiting to see a single U.S. arrest following the release of the files: Epstein (dead) and Maxwell (currently seeking a pardon from Trump in exchange for clearing his name and doing so in a “Club Fed”-style prison she was moved to by Trump’s DOJ after being interviewed by the president’ former personal lawyer Todd Blanche) remain the only ones.
At risk of stating the obvious: When a cabal of ultra-wealthy and ultra-connected individuals stand accused of some of the worst crimes against humanity, “moving on” is a hard sell. This isn’t a nasty divorce where everyone said some things they all regret. This is not behavior within the norm. And as a society, we simply cannot afford to absorb this.
The behavior we leave unchallenged now is the behavior that we tacitly accept.
Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor should have been removed from public office earlier. And no, it doesn’t feel entirely satisfactory that he was stripped of his titles — few of us have aristocratic titles, after all — and no longer (no longer?!) living off British taxpayers’ money (he now lives off King Charles’ private funds, which Charlie Boy didn’t exactly accrue by working the checkout counter at Tesco.) We do not know whether his arrest will lead to a formal charge or a criminal trial.
Nevertheless, this whole thing clearly makes one side of the Atlantic look undeniably better than the other in the handling of the Epstein files. And sure, the royals must be cognizant a crisis could be looming, considering public support for the gilded freeloaders is now lower than ever. Andrew’s not exactly a shining ambassador for their brand.
But by God, doesn’t Britain’s willingness to go after him make America look absolutely pathetic in comparison?

The UK village that has endured 50 days of rain
- Cardinham, a village in Cornwall, has experienced 50 consecutive days of rain, receiving 441.4mm since 30 December and already surpassing its typical February rainfall.
- The prolonged deluge across the UK, particularly in the south-west, is attributed to low-pressure systems being blocked by a persistent high-pressure area over Scandinavia.
- Northern Ireland recorded its wettest January on record, with south-west England and the east of Scotland also experiencing unusually high rainfall for the month.
- The Environment Agency has issued 67 flood warnings and 169 flood alerts for England, while the UK Health Security Agency has a cold health alert in place for several regions.
- While Cardinham is still forecast to have rain, the Met Office suggests conditions may moderate, with periods of more settled weather interspersed with rain.

DUBAI, February 19. /TASS/. Russia’s top female tennis player Mirra Andreeva has been knocked out from the 2026 Dubai Tennis Championships after she lost on Thursday in the quarterfinals round of the tournament to Amanda Anisimova of the United States.
The 5th-seeded Andreeva, who is playing under a neutral status at the tournament, started confidently in the opening round against 2nd-seed Anisimova, but eventually lost to the US player 6-2; 5-7; 6-7 (4-7).
"I was almost in tears there at the end," the tournament’s official website quoated Anisimova as saying after the match. "It was such a tough battle, and I thought we played incredible tennis."
"Seeing Mirra [Andreeva] down like that, it's understandable," Anisimova continued in regard to Andreeva, who almost cried in tears after the match. "We both fought so hard today, and it made me emotional seeing her like that. She was playing so well, she's the defending champion and I feel like we both won on the court today."
"These type of matches, it's always tough that someone has to lose at the end of the day," she pointed out.
"It's not easy to see someone that gives their all and then to react like that," Anisimova said. "It made me really sad for her. In my mind, I was just thinking if she keeps playing like this, there's a title around the corner for her."
"Obviously she's going to have a great year. She seems to be doing all the right things," the US tennis player added.
The 24-year-old US player is currently 6th in the WTA Top-10 Rankings and she is now set to play in the next round against her compatriot Jessica Pegula (4th-seed).
Andreeva, 18, is a four-time WTA champion. She is currently Russia's top-ranked female player at 7th place in the WTA Rankings. Her best finish at Grand Slams was at the 2024 French Open when she reached the semifinals. In 2023, the WTA named Andreeva the rookie of the year. Playing at the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, she won a silver medal in women’s doubles paired with Diana Shnaider.
The 2026 Dubai Tennis Championships is a WTA-1,000 event. It is played on February 15-21 on outdoor hard courts at the Aviation Club Tennis Centre in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Russia’s Mirra Andreeva is the tournament’s reigning champion.
Russian and Belarusian players’ neutral status at tennis tournaments
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in international tournaments, citing Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC's recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations moved to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on March 1, 2022, to suspend the membership of the Russian and Belarusian national tennis federations while also canceling all previously scheduled tennis tournaments in the two countries.
On March 14, 2022, the ITF also confirmed its prohibition on the Russian and Belarusian national tennis teams from participating in the 2022 Davis Cup and the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup.

Board of Peace necessary, because other organizations fail to keep global peace — Orban

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. The creation of the Board of Peace, which is to deal with the Gaza issue and other regional conflicts, was necessary because other international organizations are falling short in maintaining global peace and stability, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
During the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, chaired by US President Donald Trump, Orban said that there were "serious talks going on in Europe about the Board of Peace and its future role."
"We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally. We are sure that President Trump’s initiative to establish the Board of Peace is such a step in the right direction," Orban said.
Trump’s return to the White House in 2025 offered "a great chance" toward peace "not only in Gaza, but in Ukraine as well." In his opinion, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine would have never started if Trump was the US president four years ago.
"The security situation in the Middle East, and especially in Gaza, has a significant impact on the security of Europe," he said. "Therefore, our participation in the Board of Peace is not only based on principle, but also on our own security interests."
The Board of Peace was established as part of efforts to resolve the crisis in Gaza, in line with an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas. On January 22, representatives from 19 countries signed the charter of the new international organization during the World Economic Forum in Davos. US President Donald Trump intends to chair the board. Many countries have refused to participate in the body, which plans to address not only the situation in Gaza but also conflicts in other regions.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Addressing the first meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace that has been established at the United States’ initiative, US President Donald Trump said that he believes that all countries that were invited to become board members will accept.
TASS has compiled key facts about the organization and preparations for its first meeting.
Expectations for the first meeting
The Board of Peace is currently focused on settling the conflict in the Gaza Strip, US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Michael Waltz said.
However, in his words, it is flexible enough to also address other global challenges.
The Board of Peace member countries, at their first meeting in Washington on February 19, will announce the allocation of more than $5 billion to restore the Gaza Strip, US President Donald Trump said on February 15.
Member countries "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans," he noted.
The United States is expected to present a plan for Gaza restoration and the formation of an international stabilization force, Reuters reported.
Participants
According to Reuters, representatives of at least 20 world nations will take part in the meeting.
EU Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the European Union at the Board of Peace meeting, spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.
Cyprus, Turkey, Italy, Israel will be represented by top diplomats, according to their foreign ministries.
Poland and Greece will be represented by deputy foreign ministers.
Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Romanian President Nicusor Dan, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, To Lam, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet have confirmed their participation.
The Czech and Slovak foreign ministers, and two representatives of the Swiss foreign ministry will attend the Board of Peace meeting as observers.
Russia’s position
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia is ready to allocate $1 billion to the Board of Peace from its assets immobilized in the United States.
He stated that Moscow is prepared to do so even before the issue of participation in the Board's composition and its work is resolved.
Russia is currently the only country in the world to have committed such a lofty sum in aid to Palestine, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov said.
Moscow continues analyzing the entire set of proposals concerning the board’s functioning procedures, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said.
Moscow, in his words, is in no hurry to decide whether or not to participate in the Gaza Board of Peace.
Moscow’s position on the Board of Peace is being formulated, including taking into account the positions of its Middle East partners, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Russia’s representatives will not take part in the first meeting of the Board of Peace, Zakharova said.
Russia expects the Board of Peace to unequivocally call for de-escalation both in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank, Russian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya said.
Who refused to join
Mexico will attend the first meeting of the Gaza Board of Peace as an observer, but will not join it due to the absence of Palestine there, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said.
The Holy See will not participate in the work of the Board of Peace "due to its specific nature, which differs significantly from that of other states," Vatican State Secretary Cardinal Pietro Parolin said.
France thinks it unacceptable to take part in the work of the Board of Peace and will demand explanations from the European Commission, which sent its representative there without EU Council mandate, French foreign ministry spokesperson Pascal Confavreux said.
About the organization
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Along with US President Donald Trump, the leaders and representatives of Azerbaijan, Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Morocco, Mongolia, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and self-proclaimed republic of Kosovo signed the document.
More than 50 countries will join the Board of Peace, Trump said after the ceremony.
While the Board was established under the agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.
Each member state will remain on the board for not more than three years, except those who will pay a permanent membership fee of at least $1 billion, Bloomberg said, citing the board’s draft charter.
The actual powers of the Board of Peace, established on the initiative of US President Donald Trump, remain unclear, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.
The Board cannot replace the United Nations, he stressed.

Average US long-term mortgage rate dips to 6.01%, lowest level in more than 3 years

Average US long-term mortgage rate dips to 6.01%, lowest level in more than 3 years
The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate slipped this week to its lowest level in more than three years, but remains around 6% in the same narrow range it has been in this year
- Bookmark
The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate slipped this week to its lowest level in more than three years, but remains around 6% in the same narrow range it has been in this year.
The benchmark 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate fell to 6.01% from 6.09% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.85%.
The modest pullback brings the average rate to its lowest level since Sept. 8, 2022, when it was 5.89%. That was the last time the average rate was below 6%.
Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.
The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.08% at midday Thursday, down from around 4.09% a week ago.
Mortgage rates have been trending lower for months, helping drive a pickup in home sales the last four months of 2025, but not enough to lift the housing market out of its slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows.
Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes remained stuck last year at 30-year lows. And more buyer-friendly mortgage rates this year weren’t enough to lift home sales last month. They posted the biggest monthly drop in nearly four years and the slowest annualized sales pace in more than two years.
Meanwhile, new data on contract signings suggest home sales could remain sluggish in the near term.
A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales fell 0.8% in January from the previous month, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Pending home sales fell 0.4% from January last year.
There’s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.
“Improving affordability conditions have yet to induce more buying activity,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.
A sharp run-up in home prices, especially in the early years of this decade, and a chronic shortage of homes nationally worsened by years of below-average home construction have left many aspiring homeowners priced out of the market.
That's put the focus on mortgage rates, which can boost home shoppers' purchasing power when they come down, but also reduce how much homebuyers can afford when rates rise.
That makes the recent decline in rates a favorable lead in to the annual spring home-buying season — at least for home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates.
“Lower rates should improve affordability and bring out more buyers,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “Assuming mortgage rates remain at about where they are, or come down even further, we should see more buyers this spring as both inventory and the weather improves.”
Homeowners eager to refinance their existing home loan to a more favorable rate are also benefiting from easing rates.
Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, edged lower this week. That average rate fell to 5.35% from 5.44% last week. A year ago, it was at 6.04%, Freddie Mac said.
Mortgage applications, which include loans to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, rose 2.8% last week from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for mortgage refinance loans made up 57.4% of all applications.
The latest drop in mortgage rates comes three weeks after the Federal Reserve decided to pause cuts to its main interest rate after lowering rates three times in a row to close out 2025 in an attempt to shore up the job market.
Minutes released Wednesday from the Fed’s last meeting showed many officials want to see inflation fall further before they would support additional interest rate cuts this year.
The central bank doesn’t set mortgage rates, but its decisions to raise or lower its short-term rate are watched closely by bond investors and can ultimately affect the yield on 10-year Treasurys that influence mortgage rates.

At least 5,000 police to provide security in Gaza — head of Committee for Administration

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. At least 5,000 Palestinian police officers will be deployed to the Gaza Strip in the next two months to ensure security there, Chairman of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza Ali Shaath said.
"Our priorities therefore are defined into four categories: first, restore security via professional civilian police under one authority, one law and one weapon, including training and developing 5,000 Gazan police to be deployed in 60 days," Shaath told the first meeting of the Board of Peace, according to a White House broadcast.
Shaath said the organization also plans to "restore basic services, including electricity, water and education," restore basic communal infrastructure facilities and "revive economic activities" of the sector.
"Our goal is simple: step by step to lay the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity," Shaath concluded.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos the Charter of the Peace Council, established as part of a peaceful settlement in the Gaza Strip. Washington said that other states had joined the organization. The Peace Council was established in accordance with an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern Gaza, but it is assumed that it will also deal with conflict prevention and resolution in other regions.

ASX set to slide; QBE, Guzman y Gomez results; Oil jumps on US-Iran tensions
Updated ,first published
US stocks fell, while oil prices rose with worries about a potential conflict between the United States and Iran.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent for its first loss in four days. The Dow Jones dropped 267 points, or 0.5 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3 per cent.
Insurance giant QBE reported a 21 per cent rise in full-year net profit to $US2.16 billion ($3.1 billion).
Guzman y Gomez has recorded an 18 per cent uplift in total sales to $681.8 million in the first half of the 2026 financial year.
Comparable sales in Australia gained 4.4 per cent and group underlying earnings rose 23.3 per cent to $33 million. Net profits came in at $10.6 million, a 44.9 per cent increase on the same period the year before.
The burrito chain declared a fully franked interim dividend of 7.4 cents.
The ASX added 0.9 per cent on Thursday. The Australian dollar was trading at US70.59¢ at 8.22am AEDT.
On Wall Street, Booking Holdings dropped 6.1 per cent for one of the market’s sharper losses, even though the company behind the Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable brands reported a profit for the latest quarter that edged past analysts’ expectations.
Its stock has been under pressure because of worries that competitors powered by artificial-intelligence technology could upend its industry and take away customers. Booking’s stock has lost roughly a quarter of its value so far this year already.
Such worries have been rolling through Wall Street, hitting industries as far flung as software and legal services and trucking logistics. Investors have been punishing stocks of companies seen as under threat by AI so suddenly and aggressively that analysts have likened it to a “shoot first-ask questions later” mentality.
The doubts are hurting not just companies seen as potential victims of AI but also the private-credit companies that have lent them money. Blue Owl Capital fell 5.9 per cent to bring its loss for the year so far to 22.5 per cent, for example. Apollo Global Management dropped 5.2 per cent, and Ares Management sank 3.1 per cent.
Carvana sank 7.9 per cent even though the retailer reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Investors may have been paying more attention to how much profit the auto retailer made per vehicle sold, which was lower than expected.
Walmart, meanwhile, pushed and pulled on the market after jumping to an early gain of 2.7 per cent and then flipping to a loss. The retail giant delivered stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected, but it gave a profit forecast for the upcoming year that fell short of estimates. It finished the day with a loss of 1.4 per cent.
Helping to limit the market’s losses was Deere, which jumped 11.6 per cent after the machinery maker reported a higher profit than analysts expected. CEO John May said it’s seeing a continued recovery in demand from construction and smaller agricultural customers, though its global, large agricultural customers are still feeling pressure.
Some of the bigger gains in the S&P 500 came from stocks of oil companies, which climbed with the price of crude. A barrel of benchmark US crude rose 1.9 per cent to $US66.43, while Brent added 1.9 per cent to $US71.66 per barrel.
Oil prices rose with worries about a possible military confrontation between the United States and Iran. President Donald Trump has been raising the pressure on Iran, which is home to some of the world’s largest oil reserves, because of its disputed nuclear program. If a conflict were to break out, it could constrict the global flow of oil.
Occidental Petroleum jumped 9.4 per cent after it also reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 19.42 points to 6,861.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 267.50 to 49,395.16, and the Nasdaq composite lost 70.91 to 22,682.73.
In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady after a report said the number of US workers applying for unemployment benefits eased last week. That could be a signal that the pace of layoffs is slowing.
A solid job market, in turn, could keep the Federal Reserve on hold for longer before it resumes its cuts to interest rates. Fed officials said at their last meeting that they want to see inflation fall further before they would support cutting rates further this year.
If oil prices keep rising, that would push upward on inflation.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.07 per cent from 4.09 per cent late Wednesday.
Other US economic reports said that growth for manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is accelerating, but potential homebuyers across the country didn’t sign as many contracts in January to purchase. The US trade deficit also widened in December by more than economists expected.
In stock markets abroad, indexes fell in Europe following better performances in Asia.
South Korea’s Kospi jumped 3.1 per cent as trading resumed following a Lunar New Year holiday. Markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai remained closed.

Israeli army forces briefly detain 2 shepherds in Syria’s Quneitra
Israeli forces also fired 2 artillery shells toward, with no immediate reports of casualties or material damage
ISTANBUL
Israeli forces briefly detained two shepherds in Syria’s southern Quneitra province on Thursday.
The SANA news agency reported that Israeli troops arrested a young man west of Ruwayhina village and another youth west of Kodna village while they were tending sheep. Both were later released.
Israeli forces entered the western outskirts of Ruwayhina and took the shepherd to an undisclosed location before releasing him hours later, the agency said.
Israeli forces also fired two artillery shells toward the village’s surroundings, with no immediate reports of casualties or material damage, it added.
In a separate incident, Israeli forces detained a teenager while he was herding sheep west of Kodna village and released him after several hours, SANA said.
Earlier, the state-run Alikhbariah TV reported that Israeli troops arrested a child west of Kodna villag before he was released hours later.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military regarding the reported detention.
Damascus has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the 1974 disengagement agreement between the two sides. Tel Aviv announced unilaterally that it was canceling the agreement after the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime on Dec. 8, 2024.
Recent Israeli actions have included ground incursions, artillery shelling—particularly in the countryside of Quneitra and Daraa in southern Syria—arrests of civilians, the establishment of checkpoints to search and question residents, and the destruction of crops.
The Israeli incursions come despite the announcement on Jan. 6 of the formation of a contact mechanism between Syria and Israel, under US supervision, to coordinate information exchange, reduce military escalation, promote diplomatic engagement, and explore trade opportunities.
Syrians say the continued Israeli actions limit their ability to restore stability and hinder government efforts to attract investment to improve economic conditions.

YEKATERINBURG, February 19. /TASS/. Russia returned this year to the pool of countries where electronic engineering industry products are manufactured, First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said.
"The microelectronic industry is the one where we still have to labor hard. We need to significantly close the gap with global leaders there, while we were such in 1970s. Regrettably, we started gradually losing our position since the middle of 1980s, even somewhat from 1983. But I can say since this year <…> we returned to the pool of countries, and there are actually just three of them, which manufacture electronic engineering industry products," Manturov said.
Russia should master the new lithography machine for 130 nanometers, but global leaders are working with smaller standard sizes, the official added.

‘Extremely disappointed’: Minister defies residents’ noise complaints to dump Barangaroo curfew
Planning Minister Paul Scully has intervened to allow an inner Sydney cultural venue to operate around the clock, overriding a decision from bureaucrats to scale back trading hours at the harbourfront site after residents voiced concerns about late-night noise.
The NSW government had originally proposed 24/7 operating hours at the Cutaway arts and culture space, which is scheduled to reopen underneath Barangaroo’s headland park within months following a $100 million renovation.
The proposal sparked a backlash from residents in Barangaroo and Millers Point, who were worried about crowd control and noise disturbances from after-dark events. Their opposition prompted Placemaking NSW, the government agency overseeing the development, to cap operating hours for most events at midnight, with limited exceptions for major occasions such as New Year’s Eve.
In a blow to dissenting residents, Scully this week reversed that decision on grounds the Labor government was committed to its “vibrancy” reforms, which are aimed at boosting the 24-hour economy by reducing restrictions on live music, hospitality and entertainment at NSW venues.
“The new and improved Cutaway will support everything from festivals and installations to community gatherings and contemporary performance and following my request, it can operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week as needed,” Scully said.
“We will be maximising the benefit of this venue given the significant taxpayer investment made to allow it to host events that support Sydney’s growing events calendar.
“The Cutaway was created as a first-class event venue and should be allowed to function as one.”
Millers Point Community Resident Action Group president Anne Crabb said the group was “extremely disappointed” by Scully’s decision. She said the government had “overspent” on the venue and now was “desperate to find any excuse to keep the place open 24/7”.
“We believe the extended hours at this enormous, cavernous venue next to Millers Point homes will result in the erosion of residential amenity, particularly during the sensitive midnight to 7am period,” she said.
The group requested a permanent decibel monitoring system and a dedicated complaints hotline.
Crabb previously said the venue’s scale and design had heightened concerns about the cumulative effects of late events, particularly noise, crowd control and disruption to residential amenity.
“Unlike current 24/7 venues such as The Crown casino and The Star, this is a huge and open cavernous space located on the harbourfront,” she said.
“Barangaroo can and should be a vibrant cultural precinct, but this must not come at the expense of our long-standing residential community who will have to deal with the late-night impacts.”
Other residents and strata representatives from nearby apartments worried about sleep disturbance and voiced concerns the semi-enclosed structure could amplify sounds and make them reverberate.
Once completed, the renovated Cutaway will include multiple event spaces carved into the headland beneath Barangaroo Reserve, creating a space to host large art installations, performances, festivals, concerts, gala dinners, fashion shows and events including Vivid Sydney.
Originally, Placemaking NSW argued 24-hour operations would advance the state’s vision to boost nightlife, tourism and Sydney’s global standing. The Cutaway’s location next to the Barangaroo metro station was cited as a major advantage, allowing for extended trading hours supported by improved public transport access. Metro services generally operate from about 4am to midnight.
Placemaking NSW used its response to public submissions on the proposal to wind back the operating hours to 8am to midnight, with some noise controls from 10pm. Scully wrote to the agency on Monday directing staff to reinstate the original plan for 24/7 trading at the venue.
Concerns around noise were best dealt with through individual event conditions of consent, not restricting operating hours, as has been done for other event venues, the government said.
NSW 24-Hour Economy Commissioner Michael Rodrigues supported the extended hours, while Business Sydney executive director Paul Nicolaou had described the curfew as “disappointing”.
“If you choose to live in Barangaroo – in the heart of a global city – a level of noise should be expected,” Nicolaou said.
“We desperately need to ensure there are enough venues and facilities that are open 24/7.”
Construction of The Cutaway is more than 85 per cent complete. The first events are expected to start by July.

Türkiye neutralises threats at source beyond its borders: Erdogan

Türkiye takes all necessary steps beyond its borders for its security, neutralising threats at their source without seeking permission from anyone, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
Speaking at an iftar programme with families of martyrs at Cankaya Palace in the capital Ankara, Erdogan said that significant progress has been made in efforts towards a "terror-free Türkiye".
"Today, Türkiye takes all necessary steps not only within its borders but also beyond its borders for its security. Wherever there is a threat or danger, we neutralise it at its source without seeking permission from anyone," Erdogan said.
"There has been a serious decrease in security risks directed at our country, both within and beyond our borders," he said.
"In the terror-free Türkiye initiative we launched 16 months ago, we have made notable progress in a short time," he added, noting a marked reduction in security risks targeting the country.
Referring to terrorism, Erdogan said: "We are determined to rid Türkiye forever of this scourge that has burned the hearts of our nation for nearly half a century."
"For nearly half a century, this calamity has wounded our nation's heart. God willing, we are determined to free Türkiye from it permanently," he said.
He noted that thanks to operations by the armed forces and other security units, "we have significantly restricted the mobility of terrorist organisations".
Erdogan said that in the defence industry, the country has reached a domestic production rate of around 80 percent, compared to a previous dependence of about 80 percent on foreign sources.
"Today, we can meet almost all our needs ourselves in nearly every field, including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), armed UAVs, missiles, rockets, ships, helicopters and tanks," he said.
"God willing, next in line will be fighter jets and aircraft carriers," he added.
"Positive developments are also taking place in our neighbour Syria. An agreement was reached last month to resolve the issue in northern Syria without bloodshed, and the process toward full integration has begun," Erdogan said.

Should I have stood up to my boss? Or was it better to trust my gut?

Should I have stood up to my boss? Or was it better to trust my gut?
A messy thing happened at work. Mistakes and miscommunication turned into a snowball that slowly got bigger. As the consequences became apparent, I could see it might have looked like I was partly to blame – though, I wasn’t. I respect my boss, but they can be deaf to certain complex conversations, so my first instinct was to leave things be.
But the advice from people whose opinion I value – friends, family and experts I listen to or read – all went the same way: you must stick up for yourself, no matter what.
So I second guessed myself and spent a lot of time and energy gathering evidence and building a “defence” of myself. As I expected, when the “news” broke, some colleagues looked my way. I went straight to my boss and, long story short, my hours of preparation were a waste of time.
Is standing your ground, no matter what, worth it on principle alone?
Thanks for your detailed email and generously candid correspondence. What you’ve described to me is a dense and jumbled problem, and we won’t go into the details to avoid risking anyone’s anonymity.
It’s the kind of highly specific case that is tricky to pick apart in a few hundred words. But I do think one thing you brought up is worth digging into a bit further.
Work is rarely like a quiz show; you don’t get rewarded for shouting the first answer that comes into your head.
You mentioned in your question (and in your longer email) that your experience of working with your boss for a long while led you to an instinctive reaction – one that proved correct. If I can summarise your conclusion in perhaps over-simplistic terms, you ultimately realised you should have followed your gut.
I’ll start by saying that I don’t think your friends and family were outrightly wrong. But their blanket, well-intentioned advice didn’t quite work when applied to a tangled, knotty and idiosyncratic situation.
Their protestations might have been persuasive, but my guess is the main reason you were pulled towards their opinion had more to do with a kind of subtle stigma attached to going with your instincts in a professional setting.
So often we frame the world of work, especially corporate work or work conducted for a private business, as hyper-rational. It’s not true to any significant extent, but it’s a pervasive, stubborn and even a seductive story.
And although it often relates to corporate entities and those who run them – the efficient private company, the numbers-oriented founder, the cold truth of the balance sheet – it has a trickle-down effect. In some shape or form, it ends up affecting everyone involved in “the business world”.
So when a person like you, with a lot of experience, a long-term relationship with your boss and every reason to trust your instincts comes across a situation like yours, there’s often a ghostly presence pulling at your sleeve, whispering “Isn’t that the risky option?”
Of course, sometimes, going with your first intuitive thought is dangerous. Or even foolish. Work is rarely like a quiz show; you don’t get rewarded for shouting the first answer that comes into your head before anyone else.
But work is rarely a maths equation, either; what you’ve outlined in our correspondence is not the Bat and Ball Problem*, where the apparently obvious answer is, in fact, objectively wrong.
You knew that your boss would give little thought to any well-evidenced “defence” (as you put it), not because you read some tea leaves or had a vague hunch, but because many, many years of experience had told you this was highly likely. You were guessing, perhaps, but it was an educated guess.
And sometimes an educated guess is the best you can do in an intricate, labyrinthine social situation like a large workplace. Indeed, cognitive science is moving away from the long-held conventional wisdom that logic/reason and intuition/gut feel are polar opposites, and largely separate mental processes.
Again, the advice you received wasn’t inherently bad. Often, sticking up for yourself (and others) at work is critical, especially if the situation works as a kind of test case or creates a precedent.
This is where standing on principle becomes critically important. But that was not ever happening here. It sounds like the sideways glances came, the problem blew over, your reputation wasn’t damaged in the slightest, and you wasted far too much time and effort on a carefully organised explanation that was always going to be disregarded. And none of this was a surprise to you.
If you can apply any generalisation to such a convoluted affair, it’s that sometimes it’s OK – and even rational – to trust your gut.
*A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total; the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball; how much does the ball cost?

Driver cleared of murder after killing boy, 4, in pick-up truck after high-speed crash

Driver cleared of murder after killing boy, 4, in pick-up truck after high-speed crash
Owen Maughan, 27, had previously admitted to the manslaughter of Peter Maughan following the incident in Kent last year
- Bookmark
A driver who admitted killing a four-year-old boy in a crash after deliberately hitting the family’s car at around 60mph has been cleared of murder.
Owen Maughan, 27, had previously admitted to the manslaughter of Peter Maughan following the incident on New Barn Road, Dartford, Kent, on June 1 last year.
His father, Patrick Maughan, 54, who was a front-seat passenger and accused of encouraging the act, was also cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday.
Peter was thrown from the family pick-up truck and died of “severe and devastating injuries” to his head, chest and abdomen.
The trial had heard that Owen and Patrick Maughan “chased” the car down the A2 in Kent for several miles.
There was shouting between the two cars before Owen Maughan drove into the wrong lane and clipped the Ford pick-up truck at about 60mph, and the car rolled over multiple times, the court heard.
Peter Maughan was in the back of the car with his one-year-old sister Annarica Mahon, while their mother Hayley, Owen Maughan’s cousin, was in the front passenger seat and her partner Lovell Mahon was driving.
Mr Mahon suffered serious injuries including a skull fracture and is unlikely to walk again.
Owen Maughan had previously admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on Mr Mahon.
The jury also found Patrick Maughan guilty of the same charge.
The court had heard that Mr Mahon and Owen Maughan had never met and he did not associate with his cousin Hayley.
Hayley Maughan filmed video clips of the two men following them, leaving a voice note for her mother Erica in which she said she was afraid.
Giving evidence during the trial, Owen Maughan told jurors he did not know there were children in the car.
He said he believed he and Mr Mahon were going to fight after arguing back and forth between the cars, and he decided to dent the side of Mr Mahon’s car so he would stop and get out.
He denied trying to cause serious injury.
After the crash, Owen and Patrick Maughan drove off and paused for Patrick Maughan to pull the registration plate off the truck, which Owen said was done in a state of “panic”.
Jurors heard the pair had been drinking in Rochester earlier that day, and had about 12 bottles of beer and 13 pints respectively, before they began driving their Ford Ranger pick-up truck home.
Owen Maughan told jurors that they spotted a similar vehicle which made them think the drivers may also be from the traveller community, and pulled up alongside.
But he said Mr Mahon was “aggressive and pointing at me” and Maughan got “pretty pissed off with it” so he started “following him just to try and annoy him”.
He said he decided to dent the side of the other car so Mr Mahon would pull in and fight, and “couldn’t believe” what he was seeing when the car flipped over.
The pair will be sentenced at a later date.

Gaza reconstruction fund ready for donations: World Bank chief

The Gaza Reconstruction and Development Fund is ready for donations, World Bank President Ajay Banga said Thursday.
Banga said at the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington that the fund secures donor money while the board directs disbursements for crucial reconstruction and development projects in Gaza.
He assured donors that robust financial, legal and oversight mechanisms remain in place to guarantee absolute transparency about how the money is utilised.
A financial controller from the World Bank is currently seconded to the Board of Peace to help integrate the highest financial standards into the rebuilding process.
"We are helping along with the Board of Peace, which takes the ownership of ensuring that the right kind of financial, legal and oversight mechanisms are being put in place," he said.
The World Bank Group plans to leverage its triple-A rating to attract private bond money to bolster public finance initiatives for the region.
"Because of our triple-A rating, we have the ability to leverage private bond money to help to create the resources we need," he said.
Banga highlighted the global institution's capacity to effectively de-risk private investing to support the extensive rebuilding operations.
He emphasised that the World Bank brings vital on-the-ground expertise and practical knowledge gathered from operating in challenging markets worldwide.
The World Bank president stated that the institution refuses to be an armchair critic, aiming instead to be an active participant in providing Palestinians the opportunities and lives they deserve.

Nordic combined skiers may have competed in their last Olympics

Nordic goodbye?
It could be the last Olympics for a sport that mixes the grace of ski jumping with the grind of cross-country skiing.
Nordic combined events at the Milan Cortina Games ended Thursday. And the International Olympic Committee is considering scrapping it from future Games because of a small TV audience and podium positions dominated by a tiny group of nations.
As if to illustrate that point, Norway swept took gold in all three events — including Thursday's men’s team sprint — and the same countries stood on the podium at all three Nordic combined events at these Winter Games.
“Hopefully these three events have been fun to watch and I think it has been a lot of nations fighting for their medals,” Jen Luraas Oftebro, who won three golds, said after sharing the win with teammate Andreas Skoglund. “Hopefully the IOC will see the value in that.”
Nordic combined was invented some 150 years ago when a Norwegian crown prince seeking glory as a champion paired the two disciplines he excelled at.
The contest opens with a daredevil ski jump to determine the starting order for a lung-busting cross-country ski race.
“Nordic combined is such a beautiful sport and I think it deserves much more popularity because I think the races are really, really fun to watch and the athletes are doing amazing,” said Jan Vytrval, a Czech competitor. “It deserves much more than to be deleted from the Olympics.”
The sport has been included since the first Winter Games in 1924, but it is the only winter sport that doesn’t include women. Female athletes who compete on the World Cup tour and in world championships have lobbied hard to change that.
But their fate is tied to the larger sport.
The IOC has previously put off a decision on the sport's future but will revisit the question after the Games wrap up Sunday.
“If it stays, it’s for both,” said Lasse Ottesen, the Nordic combined director of the International Ski Federation. “It makes no sense to say, ‘Yes, we’re just going to have the Nordic combined men in or, yes, we're going to take the men out and we’re going to throw the women in.’ I mean why would anyone do that in these times?”
Ottesen said FIS had exceeded requirements the IOC set out in 2022, increasing the competition in the women’s sport and building media interest globally. While audience numbers grew slightly over each of the last three Olympics, he conceded it was not as much as FIS expected.
Two of the three events — the men’s individual normal hill jump and large hill ski jump competitions that were each followed by 10 kilometer ski races — sold out all 4,500 tickets allocated and 90% of the team event tickets were sold, Ottesen said.
But, he added, the cross-country venue has twice that capacity, so it “looks a little bit thinner.”
FIS President Johan Eliasch attended the Feb. 11 normal hill event with IOC President Kirsty Coventry to try to showcase the excitement that two disciplines generate.
IOC member Ingmar de Vos, a member of the committee reviewing the fate of the sport, attended the large hill event.
The contests in the last three Olympics were won by Norway, Austria, Germany and Japan. In Milan Cortina, Germany and Japan — despite starting two of the races in first place after the jump — were shut out as Finland took two individual bronzes and a team silver.
That is progress in the eyes of the sport’s supporters — and the Finns, who gave a thrilling chase for the silver medal on Thursday.
“We have done our part with competing,” said Eero Hirvonen, who won an individual bronze and shared the silver with Ilkka Herola. “We have had really interesting competitions here and I think all the attention with what our success and medals have got in Finland ... I hope it helps.”

Israeli settlers kill 19-year-old Palestinian-American, officials and witnesses say
The Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness say that Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian-American in an attack on a village

Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian-American during an attack on a village, the Palestinian Health Ministry and a witness said Thursday.
Raed Abu Ali, a resident of the village of Mukhmas, said a group of settlers came to the community Wednesday afternoon and tried to attack a farmer, prompting clashes after residents intervened. Israeli forces later arrived, and during the violence armed settlers killed 19-year-old Nasrallah Abu Siyam and injured several others.
Abu Ali said that the army shot tear gas, sound grenades and live ammunition. Israel's military acknowledged using what it called “riot dispersal methods” after receiving reports of Palestinians throwing rocks but denied that its forces fired during the clashes.
“When the settlers saw the army, they were encouraged and started shooting live bullets,” Abu Ali said. He added that they clubbed those injured with sticks after they had fallen to the ground.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health confirmed Abu Siyam's death from critical wounds sustained Wednesday afternoon near the village east of Ramallah.
Abu Siyam’s killing is the latest in a surge in violence by extremist settlers in the West Bank, which killed 240 people last year, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Seventeen Israelis were killed over the same period. The Palestinian Authority’s Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission said Abu Siyam was the first Palestinian killed by settlers in 2026.
Mukhmas and its surrounding area — most of which lies under Israeli civil and military administration — have become a hotspot for settler attacks, including arson and assaults, as well as the construction of outposts that Israeli law considers illegal.
The Israeli military said late Wednesday that unnamed suspects shot at Palestinians, who were later evacuated for medical treatment. It did not say whether any were arrested.
Abu Siyam's mother told The Associated Press that he was an American citizen, making him the second Palestinian-American to be killed by Israeli settlers in less than a year.
The U.S. Embassy did not respond to questions on Thursday.
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.
UN says Israel's acts in West Bank may be ethnic cleansing
The U.N. human rights office on Thursday accused Israel of war crimes and said practices that displace Palestinians in the occupied West Bank “raise concerns over ethnic cleansing.”
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, citing findings collected November 2024 to October 2025, said Israel was engaged in “concerted and accelerating effort to consolidate annexation” while maintaining a system “to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians.”
It said Israeli military operations in the northern West Bank “employed means and methods designed for warfare” including lethal airstrikes and forcibly transferring civilians from their homes. It also said Israel “forbade” residents from returning to their homes in northern West Bank refugee camps. The operation, which Israel said was aimed against militants, has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians.
The report also accused Palestinian security forces of using unnecessary lethal force in the same areas, killing at least eight people, and noted that the Palestinian Authority had engaged in “intimidation, detention and ill-treatment of journalists, human rights defenders and other individuals deemed critical of its rule.”
Neither Israel’s Foreign Ministry nor the Palestinian Authority responded to requests for comment. Israel has repeatedly accused the U.N. rights office of anti-Israel bias.
Last year, the U.N. human rights monitor warned of what it called “an unfolding genocide in Gaza” with “conditions of life increasingly incompatible with (Palestinians’) continued existence.”
Report finds imprisoned Palestinian journalists were tortured
The Committee to Protect Journalists said that dozens of Palestinian journalists who were detained in Israel during the war in Gaza experienced terrible conditions, including physical assaults, forced stress positions, sensory deprivation, sexual violence and medical neglect.
CPJ has documented the detention of at least 94 Palestinian journalists and one media worker during the war in Gaza. It covers 32 journalists and one media worker from Gaza, 60 from the West Bank, and two from Israel. Thirty of the journalists are still in custody, CPJ said.
The report found that half of the journalists detained were never charged with a crime and were held under Israel’s administrative detention system, which allows for suspects deemed a security risk to be held for six months and can be renewed indefinitely.
Israel’s prison services did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the report, but had rejected a similar report in January about conditions for Palestinian prisoners as “false allegations,” contending it operates lawfully, is subject to oversight and reviews complaints.
UN development chief says removing Gaza rubble will take 7 years
The vast destruction across Gaza will take at least seven years just to remove the rubble, according to the United Nations Development Program.
Alexander De Croo, the former Belgian prime minister who just returned from Gaza, said that the UNDP had removed just 0.5% of the rubble and people in Gaza are experiencing “the worst living conditions that I have ever seen.”
De Croo said 90% of Gaza’s 2.2 million people live in “very, very rudimentary tents” in the middle of the rubble, which poses health dangers and a danger from exploding weapons.
He said UNDP has been able to build 500 improved housing units, and has 4,000 more that are ready, but estimates the true need is 200,000 to 300,000 units. The units are meant to be used temporarily while reconstruction takes place. He called on Israel to expand access for goods and items needed for reconstruction and the private sector to begin development.

Uzbekistan to make a ‘meaningful contribution’ to Gaza reconstruction, says Uzbek president
Shavkat Mirziyoyev says Board of Peace to help create favorable environment for economic, social recovery of Gaza
ISTANBUL
Uzbekistan is ready to make a “meaningful contribution” to the construction of residential buildings, kindergartens, schools and hospitals in the Gaza Strip, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said Thursday at the first Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
Mirziyoyev expressed confidence that the boar’s work "will help create a favorable environment for the economic and social recovery of the Gaza Strip."
"Uzbekistan supported the peacekeeping initiative to establish the Board of Peace and firmly stated its intention to play a practical role in its successful implementation," said Mirziyoyev, adding that the meeting reflects international solidarity, peacemaking and a shared desire to improve the situation in the Middle East.
"We must use this historic opportunity to build a new Gaza with a thriving economy and decent living conditions for all its people," he noted.
Mirziyoyev underlined that the summit is "the result of the political will and pragmatism" of US President Donald Trump.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.

Postwar Gaza framework presented at Board of Peace meeting
New administrative office, police recruitment, demilitarization plan outlined as part of transition roadmap
ISTANBUL
Senior officials on Thursday presented a framework for Gaza’s postwar governance, security, and reconstruction during a meeting of the Trump-backed Board of Peace, detailing proposals ranging from institutional rebuilding to the formation of a new Palestinian police force.
Nickolay Mladenov, director-general of the Board of Peace, announced the creation of a new administrative mechanism intended to support Gaza’s future civilian leadership.
“Today we're very happy to announce that we're creating the Office of the High Representative for Gaza, of the Board of Peace, which will be there to support, to guide, and to assist the National Committee for the administration of Gaza, hopefully removing the roadblocks that they will be facing in taking over civilian and administrative control of the Gaza Strip,” he said.
Mladenov said the office would operate under the supervision of the board and its executive body and coordinate with Israeli and Palestinian institutions, as well as an international stabilization force.
He also revealed that recruitment for a transitional Palestinian police force had already begun.
“As of this morning, we started the process of recruiting the Palestinian police force … and just in the first few hours, we have 2,000 people who have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force to be formed in Gaza under the authority of the National Committee, with the support of the Board of Peace trained in Egypt,” he said.
According to Mladenov, the force would be central to restoring order during the transition phase.
“It is this Palestinian security force under the authority of the National Committee for the transition period that will allow us to ensure that all factions in Gaza are dismantled and all weapons are put under the control of one civilian authority,” he said.
He thanked Qatar, Egypt and Türkiye for supporting mediation efforts and emphasized that reconstruction depended on disarmament, saying: “There is no other option except the full demilitarization and decommissioning of all weapons in Gaza for reconstruction to begin and for people to have a new way of life going forward.”
Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair also addressed the meeting, describing Gaza’s governance record as deeply troubled and calling for sweeping reforms.
“For decades, Gaza's governance has been characterized by extremism, corruption, ineffective institutions, and the complete absence of a route to prosperity for the Gazan people,” he said.
Blair outlined a vision for Gaza based on functioning public institutions, economic opportunity and technological development.
“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace … a genuine commitment to a region where, whether you're a Muslim, Jew, Christian, of any faith or none, you can rise by your own efforts, and feel your government by your side, not on your back,” he said.
He added that President Donald Trump’s proposed framework “remains the best, indeed the only hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world.”

Trump extends some US sanctions against Russia for another year
US President Donald Trump has officially extended sanctions against Russia over its aggression against Ukraine for another year.
Source: a notice published in the US Federal Register, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The executive order, which takes effect on 20 February, provides for the extension of a number of anti-Russian sanctions introduced by US presidents' executive orders in 2014, 2018 and 2022.
The first executive order on sanctions against Russia was issued in 2014. US President Barack Obama's executive order No. 13660, which was published on 6 March 2014, provided for the freezing of the property of a number of individuals.
Initially, sanctions were applied to those who had facilitated Russia's occupation of Crimea.
The sanctions list was subsequently updated several times during the presidency of Joe Biden.
Background:
- On 8 January, US Senator Lindsey Graham announced that President Donald Trump had given the green light to a bipartisan Russia sanctions bill.
- In mid-November, Graham announced that Trump had given Congress his "blessing" to move on the long-stalled Russia sanctions bill.
- In September it was reported that US senators have drafted new legislation aimed at significantly expanding US sanctions on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers.

Feb 19 - Belarusian opposition politician Mikola Statkevich, who refused deportation to Lithuania after his 2025 release and was imprisoned again, has been freed after he suffered a stroke while in custody, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Thursday.
Statkevich was one of 52 prisoners freed in Belarus in September 2025 after an appeal from U.S. President Donald Trump, including journalists and political opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko. All were brought to the Lithuanian border, but Statkevich was the only one who refused to cross.
"I am relieved that he is free and able to hug his wife, who waited for him for so long," Tsikhanouskaya wrote on X, posting a picture of Statkevich and his wife smiling. She said that he could barely speak following the stroke.
Statkevich, 69, ran unsuccessfully against Lukashenko in a presidential election in 2010. He was arrested in May 2020 and sentenced in 2021 to 14 years in a maximum-security prison for "organising riots". REUTERS

Three ways to stop nerves from ruining your next job interview

Opinion
Three ways to stop nerves from ruining your next job interview
Job interviews are strange arenas. Capable people walk in prepared and walk out wondering why their brain suddenly forgot things it’s known for years.
I’ve worked with senior leaders, high-potential graduates and seasoned executives for over a decade, and I can say this with confidence: interview nerves are common, human, and say far less about ability than most people think.
Yet, we still keep to a comfortable myth that interviews reward the most qualified person. In reality, they often reward the person who can access their competence under pressure. That’s an entirely different skill. And we don’t teach it enough.
The moment evaluation and judgement enter the room, the nervous system goes into overdrive. Your heart rate rises, your memory retrieval dips, self-consciousness creeps in, and suddenly, a simple question feels loaded.
So beyond rehearsing answers, here are three practical ways to show up with calm, credible confidence.
1. Treat it as a two-way conversation. One mistake many candidates make is they approach the interview with desperation: you have a job, and I need that job. But that can turn into tension, or worse, desperation.
Instead of saying, “I handle pressure well”, describe a time you managed a tight deadline or a difficult stakeholder.
That mindset creates pressure instantly. And when people feel desperate to impress, they become overly self-conscious, monitoring how they sound, how they look, whether they’re saying the “right” thing. That’s when answers get stiff and authenticity disappears.
A stronger frame is mutual evaluation. Yes, the employer is assessing capability. But you’re also assessing fit. Is the role, the culture, the leadership, the growth something that’s aligned with what you want? This is a two-way decision.
This shift changes how the brain reads the situation, and that changes how you show up.
2. Replace adjectives with evidence. Early in my career, I conducted thousands of screening interviews. I constantly heard: I’m proactive. I’m a strong communicator. I’m a team player.
None of these landed without evidence. What made someone stand out was when they provided a specific example or short story to back up what they were saying.
Instead of saying, “I handle pressure well,” describe a time you managed a tight deadline or a difficult stakeholder. Paint the picture briefly. What happened, what action you took, what changed as a result.
For example, “Two weeks before a product launch, our supplier pulled out. I sourced alternatives and reworked the timeline with the team. As a result, we launched only three days late and kept our biggest client.”
People remember stories and they trust examples.
3. Calm the body first. Interview anxiety is physiological. Trying to “think calm” rarely works if the body feels under threat. The body needs to know it’s safe first. So here are two simple tools you can use in the moment to help signal internal safety and help regulate your state.
First, before the interview begins, breathe with a longer exhale (for instance, inhale for four counts, exhale for eight). A slow, extended exhale tells the nervous system there’s no immediate threat.
Second, ground your posture. Whether you’re standing or sitting, plant your feet firmly on the ground, relax your shoulders, and hold your chin level. Because of the brain-body feedback loop, your posture influences how steady and assured you feel, and how you appear.
Interviews rarely reveal the full picture of someone’s capability. All they do is capture a narrow snapshot of how someone handles evaluation, judgement, uncertainty and pressure in a short window of time. It’s an imperfect system, but it’s the one most workplaces still rely on.
Anxiety often shows up because something matters. But left unmanaged, it can distort how capable you appear. That’s why the person who manages their nerves best in the moment often ends up being the one who gets the callback.

Trump says Iran deal won't come easy, but talks going well

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. Washington’s negotiations with Tehran are going well, but it won't be easy to reach an agreement, US President Donald Trump said during the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
"You know, good talks are being held," he said. "It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran. We have to make a meaningful deal, otherwise bad things happen, but we have to make a meaningful deal."
He reiterated that Washington will not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and claimed that Tehran is still entertaining the idea.
"We do have some work to do with Iran," Trump said. "They can't have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon."
Earlier, CBS reported that the American administration is considering striking Iran on February 21. In January, the White House warned that it was ready to use force if Tehran fails to engage in talks aimed at reaching a "fair deal" under which Iran completely drops any plans to obtain nuclear weapons. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it had no plans of creating a nuclear bomb.
On February 17, the second round of negotiations between the US and Iran on the nuclear issue took place in Geneva, mediated by Oman. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached mutual understanding on a number of issues, which could serve as a basis for a draft future agreement on the nuclear program. US Vice President JD Vance said that the talks went well on a number of aspects, but Tehran is not yet ready to accept some of the fundamental positions outlined by the White House. Earlier, the United States and Israel insisted that Iran not only scrap its nuclear program, but also stop producing ballistic missiles and supporting pro-Iranian forces in the Middle East.

Trump tells Board of Peace he’ll decide on bombing Iran within 10 days
Washington: US President Donald Trump says he will likely decide whether to launch strikes against Iran over the next 10 days, as he continues the biggest American miliary build-up in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Trump made the remarks in Washington at the first meeting of the Board of Peace, a new international alliance convened by Trump that has so far been snubbed by a number of major US allies, including Australia.
“Iran is a hotspot right now,” Trump said. “Good talks are being had. It’s proven to be over the years not easy to make a meaningful deal. We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen.”
The president referred to his strikes in June on Iran’s major nuclear facilities, which he said had decimated the Islamic Republic’s ability to develop nuclear weapons and cleared the way for a deal to end Israel’s war in Gaza.
“Now we may have to take a step further, or we may not,” Trump said. “Maybe we’re going to make a deal. But you’re going to be finding out over the next probably 10 days.”
The comments followed reports in US media outlets on Wednesday (Washington time) that Trump had been briefed that the US was now militarily ready to strike Iran, given the number of assets surged to the region.
That includes two of the US’s largest aircraft strike carrier groups, the USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Gerald Ford – the latter of which is still on its way – and dozens of aircraft refuelling tankers that were tracked heading toward Europe and the Middle East this week.
Trump has previously given false timelines to Tehran. Last June, ahead of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, he said he would decide “within two weeks” – but dropped bombs two days later.
Meanwhile, representatives of the Board of Peace said progress had been towards securing Gaza, which was the original impetus for the organisation before Trump expanded its remit.
Five nations have agreed to commit troops to the United Nations-mandated International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that will be tasked with securing peace in the wartorn territory: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania.
The force will be commanded by US Major General Jasper Jeffers, who said Indonesia agreed to fill the deputy commander’s post. Egypt and Jordan have agreed to train a Palestinian police force.
An ISF brigade would be assigned to each of five sectors in Gaza, Jeffers said: Rafah, Khan Yunis, Deir al-Balah, Gaza City and North Gaza, starting with Rafah in the south.
Former Bulgarian minister and diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, the board’s director-general for Gaza, said 2000 Palestinians signed up to join a transitional police force in just a few hours this week.
Trump, meanwhile, announced nine Board of Peace members had pledged $US7 billion ($10 billion) towards a Gaza relief package. The Associated Press reported that figure was about a tenth of what was ultimately needed to rebuild the shattered territory after the two-year war between Israel and Hamas.
Former British prime minister Tony Blair, speaking about the future governance of Gaza, said the territory had “vast” potential, with 40 kilometres of Mediterranean coastline, proximity to regional and global markets and a population whose median age was just 19.
Blair pledged that a future Gaza would boast effective public institutions, a tolerant education system and a business-friendly, tech-enabled society – though he provided no details about how this would be achieved.
“This is a vision of Gaza as part of the Middle East at peace - not a phony peace of declarations no one means, and agreements no one intends to keep,” he said.
Trump’s peace plan remained “the best and only” hope for Gaza, the region and the wider world, Blair said.
Billionaire Cypriot-Israeli real estate mogul Yakir Gabay presented an ambitious six-stage redevelopment plan for Gaza, again starting in the south. The coastline, he said, “can be developed as a new Mediterranean riviera with 200 hotels and potential islands”.
The inaugural meeting of Trump’s Board of Peace attracted several heads of state from founding members, including the King of Bahrain and the presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Romania and Argentina.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto confirmed his country would contribute 8000 or more troops to the peacekeeping force in Gaza, and said he was optimistic Trump’s peace plan could succeed. “There will be problems, but we will prevail,” he said.
Other members sent prime ministers or other ministers, including Israel, which was represented by Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, while some countries attended the meeting as “observers”.
Numerous US allies were absent, especially from Western Europe. The United Kingdom, France and Germany have rejected joining the board, while Trump rescinded an invitation to Canada.
Ukraine refused to join after Trump extended an invitation to Russia, which has not yet agreed to participate.
Australia has not made a final decision, but Foreign Minister Penny Wong told Senate estimates that joining the organisation would incur legally binding obligations.
“That requires a range of considerations that are quite different to those which apply to other international groupings or commitments we’ve entered into,” she said earlier in February.

The NSW town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year

The NSW town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year
Orange has been revealed as the regional NSW suburb where buyers splashed the most cash on houses in 2025.
Most top-ranked towns were inland, with only one by the beach. The Central West foodie destination took out the top spot, recording $688,087,299 in house sales, according to Cotality’s Best of the Best 2025 report, which tracks the total value of sales in the 12 months to September.
While the median house price was a modest $693,783 at the end of November, high-end listings, including an $8 million trophy sale, helped Orange take the top spot. There were 898 house sales over that period in the Central West city.
Cotality research director Tim Lawless said Orange was the second-largest suburb in NSW by area, which also contributed to the result.
It nudged ahead of the largest suburb, Port Macquarie, partly due to the sheer number of houses that changed hands. The Mid North Coast suburb was the only coastal spot to feature in Cotality’s regional top five.
“Orange had a turnover rate of 5.7 per cent, well above the national average of 5 per cent,” said Lawless.
The drivers of Orange’s economy – a large teaching hospital, a gold mine and an outpost of the state’s Departments of Primary Industries and Regional Development – meant workers came and went, increasing turnover, according to Lawless.
The large numbers of students and temporary workers also supported Orange’s rental market, in turn attracting investors, said Michael Wright, an agent at Peter Fisher Orange.
“People who are priced out of the city market will buy an investment property here as a way to build wealth, with a view to possibly moving here down the track.”
Orange last year was named Australia’s top retirement destination in research from rewards platform Citro (backed by AMP).
Wright said the hospital, which expanded in 2011, and the adjoining medical precinct were drawing growing numbers of visitors and new residents.
“Instead of having to go to Sydney to get treated, people from the bush can come to Orange. We also get a lot of people from further out west retiring here because they want the things a city can offer, but in the country.”
Wright retired from farming and moved to Orange in the 1990s with his wife and three children. He said the city was a “magic” place to raise kids.
“Our springs and autumns have to be seen to be believed.”
Orange Mayor Tony Mileto said it had changed over time but had kept its heart. “It’s still welcoming, inclusive and community focused.”
Mileto said the community reached out to support his sister when she lost her husband in a motor vehicle accident in 1989, for example.
The growing Orange Food Week and Orange Wine Festival were attracting tree-changers from larger cities, Mileto said.
“The diversity in our economy is supporting consistent demand for housing at different cost points,” he said.
Orange’s tight rental market and rising house prices – the median has jumped 42.9 per cent in the past five years, according to Cotality – was “a concern” for some long-time residents, Mileto said.
“The challenge is managing growth in a way that welcomes new residents without displacing the people who already call Orange home.”
To address this, Orange City Council has partnered with Landcom to develop a vacant parcel of land. Dubbed Redleaf, the development will deliver more than 300 new homes.
Of the city’s existing stock, houses priced below $800,000 have been attracting the greatest interest, said agent Anthony Cook of John Cook Real Estate.
“We are receiving a lot of investment enquiries for lower-end properties – anything from $400,000 up to $800,000,” he said.
Cook said many affordable properties sold while tenanted. “If they’re not, generally you can find a tenant before the property settles.”
In the centre of town, on the streets surrounding Cook Park, large Victorian homes can change hands for between $3 million and $4 million, Cook said.
On the outskirts, large acreages with grand homesteads can command much higher prices. In August, the 49-hectare Rosedale Farm sold for $8 million.
Cook said the town’s positives far outweighed any worries.
“We’ve got some of the greatest vineyards in the country, for example, and they’re all quite close to town. There is something for everyone here.”
Lawless said Orange’s diverse economy, lifestyle attractions and relative affordability meant the city would probably continue to see price growth.
“That blend of affordability and liveability makes it very attractive. And it’s got some good wine, which never hurts.”

Taylor may shoot for the summit. Even his backers will settle for base camp

Opinion
Taylor may shoot for the summit. Even his backers will settle for base camp
Depending on who you talk to in the Liberal Party, the early mail on Angus Taylor’s leadership prospects ranges from “he will be gone by the end of 2026” to “he will put in a good showing but lose in 2028.”
Some Liberal MPs, especially those in the centre-right and unaligned groupings who were booted out of shadow cabinet, are upset. But most moderates were spared a purge of the shadow ministry, and the 34-17 margin (in the Taylor-Sussan Ley leadership ballot) has drawn a line under the contest.
Now Taylor’s real task begins: restoring the Coalition as a credible alternative government.
Taylor and his allies have just executed a relatively bloodless coup.
First, they stayed the hand of the younger Andrew Hastie in the contest to replace Sussan Ley and then, after prevaricating for most of a week, Taylor and his crew pulled off the double and brought the career of the first woman to lead the Liberal Party to an unhappy end.
Taylor, his deputy Jane Hume and his allies have also pulled off a deft refresh off the frontbench, bringing back harder-edged conservatives including Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Hastie and Sarah Henderson while promoting younger talent including Tim Wilson and Claire Chandler to the two most senior economic portfolios.
Of the 22 Liberals in the 30-member shadow ministry, 12 are now under 50 (up from seven) and 10 MPs are over 50.
That matters because as even one of Taylor’s close allies admits, when not hyperbolically claiming the Albanese government is the worst in Australian history: “Gus might be able to get us to base camp in 2028 [the next federal election] but it’s hard to see him reaching the summit.”
Why some Liberals think it’s a good idea to regularly insult Australians’ intelligence and tell them they elected the worst government in history just nine months ago is a question for another time.
Another Taylor ally told me in the lead-up to the leadership ballot: “We need to make generational change. We need to shock Labor. What we need to do is put in place the mechanisms for success over a longer period of time. We need a five-year pathway to 2031.”
In other words, it may not be until 2031 – under a leader who is not Taylor – that the Coalition has a chance of winning government. So Taylor’s allies are glum rather than cock-a-hoop because they realise their man probably only gets one shot at leading the party and that’s now – given his age (59), the need for further renewal and, most of all, because they can count.
Labor holds a record 94 seats in the lower house and the Coalition a paltry 42. A Taylor win or even forcing the Albanese government into minority in 2028 would be a near-miracle. As a Ley supporter observes: “Every time they claim Albanese is the worst government in history, they’re telling voters they got it wrong … even though he won 94 seats.”
The predictions of bruised and cranky Ley supporters about Taylor’s prospects are, unsurprisingly, far more pessimistic than the new leader’s supporters’.
“I think the party room is going to start realising by the end of March they’ve made a terrible mistake and he’s not up to it,” a second Ley supporter told me this week. “They will switch to Hastie by the end of the year.”
Of course, that would mean installing Hastie (or Wilson) before they may be ready to lead – and so prematurely burn through a future leader.
The idea that Taylor could be ousted by the end of the year, as sketched out by the second Ley supporter, seems less likely given his colleagues’ benchmark for his success should be low, in line with the Liberals’ record-low poll numbers.
Angus Taylor is no Tony Abbott. He risks damaging his own credibility, rather than that of the government, if he attempts to emulate Abbott, one of his mentors, and simply opposes everything. Taylor is not facing an unstable minority government at war with itself.
Yet he has already signalled opposition to any change to the capital gains tax – as Labor has foreshadowed could be made in the next budget – and labelled it a tax that would reduce the supply of housing, rather than a tax discount for investment properties.
The new opposition leader’s situation is less like Abbott’s in 2010 and more like that faced by John Howard in 1985, when he became Liberal leader after Bob Hawke’s second election win. Howard realised that the way to return the Liberals and Nationals to base camp and a chance of reaching the summit was by restoring the Coalition’s economic credibility. He backed some of the Hawke government’s free-market reforms.
There is an argument that this kept the Coalition in opposition for longer at the time, but it also set up Howard to lead a long-term government from 1996 – because the parties’ economic and policy credentials had been restored. That, rather than opposition for its own sake, should be Taylor’s goal, even if it means he has to pass the torch to Hastie or Wilson one day.
It’s not clear that Taylor has realised this. He doesn’t sound credible when he opposes tax policy sight unseen, or describes the Albanese government in overblown terms.
There are people in the Coalition who believe a modest structural reform to the tax system is reasonable and that the opposition should simply bank the savings and move on.
There are two more things Taylor can do to begin the task of restoring the Coalition’s credibility: release the election review conducted by party elders Nick Minchin and Pru Goward, which has been put on hold after a legal warning from Peter Dutton, and address the Coalition’s failures.
As that first Ley supporter puts it: “It’s the worst election result in the party’s history and they haven’t even released a summary document [of the review], let alone a conclusive document.
“I’m still waiting for a Liberal MP to say they’re sorry – ‘We got it wrong, we let you down, we made mistakes and we will make sure we don’t do it again’ … but they can’t even do that.”
Taylor, at least, has apologised for the opposition’s decision to oppose a tax cut. He should go further. The road to credibility for a federal opposition runs through sensible commentary and constructive criticism, not hyperbole. It must present itself as a “safe change”, as Howard realised and as Albanese did in 2019-22 when he strategically backed certain Coalition government decisions and opposed others.
Can Taylor turn the volume down from 11?

Role of the media in Israel’s national security psychological crisis - opinion
Unknown

Israel’s greatest strategic asset has never been its size, geography, or even military strength. It has been resilience – the collective psychological ability of society to absorb shock, mobilize under pressure, and recover from trauma while preserving democratic life.
In a country where nearly every family is connected to the military, where reserve duty interrupts careers, and where conflict periodically disrupts daily life, resilience is not a slogan – it is infrastructure. It is what allows a small, embattled democracy to function in a volatile region.
Yet today, an uncomfortable question must be asked: Is Israeli media, despite its democratic vitality and professional strengths, inadvertently weakening the very resilience that sustains the country?
The issue is not freedom of the press, nor criticism of government – both essential in a democracy. The problem lies in how modern media dynamics, competition, and political polarization combine to create a constant psychological stress environment that erodes social cohesion over time.
In conditions of persistent conflict, the media ceases to be merely an information channel. It becomes part of a national security psychology crisis – shaping how citizens emotionally experience threats and crises.
And right now, that experience is often corrosive.
I came to understand this firsthand two decades ago while serving as strategic adviser to then-public security minister Uzi Landau, then minister of public security, at a time when Israel broadened its understanding of internal security challenges in ways similar to the United States after 9/11.
While terror attacks inflicted horrific human costs, they were tactically destructive but psychologically strategic.
Terror aimed to spread panic far beyond the immediate victims.
To counter this, I developed training programs for police and first responders focused on managing the public psychological environment during and after attacks – rethinking the terror scene from a media coverage perspective. The guiding principle was simple: restore visible law and order quickly. Demonstrate control. Reduce panic. Help society return to normal life as quickly as possible.
I recruited leading members of the Israeli media who participated in simulations alongside police commanders, learning how coverage could either amplify terror or limit its psychological spread.
On February 22, 2004, theory collided with reality.
I was in a taxi on my way to the gym in Jerusalem, several cars ahead of Egged bus No. 14A, when a suicide bomber detonated explosives during morning rush hour near Liberty Bell Park. The explosion threw our taxi forward. As the driver sped away from the blast, I jumped out and ran back toward the scene to help.
The devastation was horrific. But what mattered most to me was how the event would be communicated to millions of Israelis watching at home.
At the scene, I worked with the police and first responders to arrange that local media focus on police and rescue operations – restoring order, assisting victims, demonstrating control – rather than broadcasting graphic images that would magnify fear nationwide. For the foreign media, I suggested we get them focused on the gruesome visuals, while the role of the Israeli coverage was to help signal something critical: the state was functioning, authorities were in control, and society would continue.
In that moment, the media played a direct and responsible role in national resilience and securing Israel’s National Security Psychology.
Two decades later, the environment has grown worse by leaps and bounds. While the advent of new television channels like 14 and 15 has, in many ways, created a better balance for the effects of political leanings in our media coverage, some of the systemic challenges to our national security have gone unaddressed.
Perpetual cycle of breaking news in Israel
Today, nonstop crisis coverage exhausts the public. Israeli viewers live in a perpetual state of breaking news. Studio panels, speculation, and political confrontation dominate airtime. Even routine developments are framed as dramatic turning points. Emotional fatigue replaces solidarity.
National resilience requires psychological recovery breaks, even if they are designed into the news coverage of the day. Instead, coverage often keeps the country in permanent alarm mode.
Polarization is amplified nightly. Television panels resemble political battlegrounds rather than forums for sober analysis. Debate is healthy in a democracy, but when internal conflict becomes the main spectacle, citizens absorb a message of division rather than shared purpose. While this phenomenon is not unique to Israel, as anyone who has watched the international news can attest, it is Israel’s security challenges that make our situation unique and a far greater risk.
Endless repetition of traumatic images compounds the damage. Ongoing reporting becomes psychological overload when replayed continuously, creating despair rather than resilience.
In the movie Network (1976), Sidney Lumet’s biting satire about television, media power, and public outrage, veteran news anchor Howard Beale grabs the attention of his TV audience in a pivotal scene by urging them to literally stand up, go to their windows, and – as an expression of collective frustration and disillusionment with the state of the world and their own helplessness in it – shout in unison, “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take this anymore!”
That scene feels particularly relevant to Israel’s current media environment because many outlets today mirror the same dynamics Network satirized decades ago: prioritizing outrage-driven content that stokes emotional reaction over sober reporting, chasing ratings over responsibility by amplifying sensationalism, elevating celebrity news personalities whose personas overshadow factual context, and turning news into spectacle rather than journalism.
When journalistic ethics lose out to profit or politically focused motives, societal trust is one of the first casualties.
Trust also erodes when the line between journalism and political messaging blurs.
Only a few months ago, while opening one of Israel’s most trusted news platforms on my phone, I encountered a highly charged political advertisement dominating the screen without clear labeling distinguishing it from editorial content. Only after clicking through, was it clear that this was paid messaging rather than journalism, but it had already influenced how I read and interpreted the news that I consumed after seeing the advertising.
Concerned, I wrote privately to a senior representative of the organization warning that blurring news and advertising risks sacrificing long-term credibility for short-term revenue. The response I received was candid: “You are correct. I will deal with it.”
The incident was resolved, but the lesson remains: when citizens cannot distinguish whether they are seeing journalistic reporting or editorial messaging, trust declines. This collapse of trust is not only in the media, but in the government, in the army, in the courts, and across all the major institutions that are critical to our collective survival. None of this necessarily implies malicious intent.
Democracy requires accountability – but it also requires social cohesion. A society cannot sustain constant internal psychological conflict while facing persistent external threats.
National resilience-oriented responsible journalism does not mean propaganda. It means informing without inflaming, scrutinizing without destroying confidence, and exposing failures without convincing citizens their society is irreparably broken.
National security is not only about armies and missile defense: it is also about our collective psychology. It is about whether citizens have the trust and belief that their society can endure.
And that belief and trust is reshaped, every day, on the news.

Which Perth suburb had the most crime in 2025?

Which Perth suburb had the most crime in 2025?
Crime last year was down to its lowest level in Western Australia since 2022, according newly released WA Police statistics.
And while some suburbs saw a dramatic downturn in criminal activity, for others it was a different story.
WAtoday has examined the data and compiled a per capita snapshot of each suburb, giving a fairer picture of which areas of Perth suffered the most issues.
While some of the top contenders are to be expected, given their proximity to nightlife and retail precincts, others emerged as surprising crime hotspots.
The data collect by police unsurprisingly shows that Perth and Northbridge topped the list of suburbs with the most crime, followed by Cannington, south of the city, which is home to Carousel shopping centre.
The figures show that while crime in Cannington has decreased by 2 per cent over the last 12 months, it has risen by nearly 70 per cent since 2020. Stealing offences, in particular, have almost doubled in that time.
Fourth on the top 10 list is the eastern suburb of Forrestdale, where crime has risen sharply – an increase of 93 per cent since 2021.
The suburb sits within the City of Armadale and is advertised to potential home owners as offering a semi-rural lifestyle where the median house price is currently about $850,000 and median rent is just over $700 a week.
Forrestdale houses just over 1000 residents, according to the last census, but assault reports – both family and non-family – appear to blame for the big increase in crime statistics.
The next suburb on the list sits on the end of the train line and is generally considered a crime zone due to its low socio-economic status.
While house prices in Midland have risen, they still sit at a more affordable median range of $600,000 with rents also sitting at around $600 a week.
But while Midland is home to over 6000 people and regularly sits at the top of the most crime-ridden suburbs in Perth, crime there has actually decreased significantly in the last year.
The figures show crime in the town has dropped by 15 per cent from 2024 to 2025. Stealing is down, graffiti is down, breaching a restraining order is down, sexual offences are down and so is robbery.
Fremantle sits sixth on the top 10 list, but it has also seen a reduction in crime of 10 per cent over the last 12 months, followed by Karawara, just south of the city.
However, the centrally located suburb that is close to Curtin University has bucked the trend and seen an increase in crime of nearly 5 per cent which, despite the area now commanding on average nearly $1 million for houses.
Burswood, home to WA’s only casino, is eighth on the list and has also seen a reduction in crime of 15 per cent, along with Cockburn Central at ninth, where crime has reduced by more than 7 per cent in the last year.
Tenth on the list this year is Armadale, where the crime rates have almost remained the same between 2024 and 2025.
Other suburbs across the metro area that also saw a big reduction in crime include Rivervale in Perth’s east, which sits in the City of Belmont about six kilometres from the CBD. Home to almost 11,000 residents, the crime there over the past year dropped dramatically by 33 per cent.
An even bigger reduction was seen in Queens Park, where crime reports halved, and in Karrinyup where crime dropped by 35 per cent between 2024 and 2025.
Cloverdale, about 10 kilometres east of the city, also saw a big reduction in crime by 30 per cent, while Victoria Park and Carlisle saw crime drop by 28 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.
Crime has gone up in a few instances, including in the northern Perth suburb of Two Rocks, where reports almost doubled, and in Shoalwater near Rockingham, where crime rose by 40 per cent over the last 12 months.
Other suburbs that saw a rise in issues included Woodbridge (39 per cent), Maylands (26 per cent), Parmelia (25 per cent), Balcatta (20 per cent) and Alkimos (19 per cent).
Our regional towns also saw some big jumps in crime numbers, with both Narrogin and Newman seeing a reduction in crime.
Kununurra, however, still rates as one of the worst places for crime in the state, rivalling Perth’s entertainment precincts for crime reports per capita.

News Corp HQ locked down as Lachlan Murdoch, Albanese make Holt St pilgrimage for Sky’s name change

News Corp HQ locked down as Lachlan Murdoch, Albanese make Holt St pilgrimage for Sky’s name change
In this week’s On Background, News Corp staff to make way for the unveiling of Sky News’ rebrand, Sharri Markson’s decision to steer clear of Pauline Hanson (for a time) is vindicated, and the ABC tries to find a new 7.30 boss.
Nothing to see here
In pre-modern Japan, ordinary people were often forbidden from looking their emperor in the eye. At times, he was said to hold audiences behind bamboo screens.
So it seems to be with Lachlan Murdoch – the heir to the Sun King – who is set to be on hand to open Sky News’ plush new Holt Street studios in Surry Hills (and announce the network’s new name!) on Friday afternoon.
On Thursday evening, Sky issued an “areas closure” notice to staff, telling those not invited to the august event, which will also be attended by the likes of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and NSW Premier Chris Minns, to stay out.
They won’t be allowed access to the main foyer, cafe, or main stairwell from Thursday evening, all the way through until Friday night.
Organisers have also gone as far as disconnecting the cameras in the studio where the event will be held, so nobody can see in as they get ready for the big reveal. Or maybe it’s just to keep Lachie separate from the foot soldiers? Or is there insufficient catering?
It’s a total lockdown, with all of Friday’s on-air programming to be produced in Melbourne, instead.
Sky is, of course, being forced to rebrand after its naming licence holder, Comcast-owned British broadcaster Sky News, decided against renewing the latest decade-long deal that expires this year.
The name change is expected to come into effect in the middle of the year, but the company has chosen to kill two birds with one stone, and use the studios’ opening party for the big reveal, one day after the station turned 30.
A Sky spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Along with Murdoch, the event will be hosted by Sky News Australia chief executive and former newspaper editor Paul Whittaker, with News Corp Australia boss Michael Miller also in attendance. There are rumours of News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson jetting in, too.
Sky’s Sydney studios were previously in Macquarie Park, northern Sydney, but were relocated to News Corp’s long-term Holt Street offices near Central Station in December. The premises are also home to The Australian, news.com.au and The Daily Telegraph.
Sky Australia’s current licence deal was agreed while the British Sky News was still part-owned by News Corp.
One source with knowledge of the planned rebrand, who was not authorised to speak on the record, said in August that a proposal to rebrand Sky as Fox News Australia was rejected by New York HQ because of the latter’s polarising reputation Down Under, and the need for brand differentiation. The final decision needed ticking off by the company’s Avenue of the Americas offices, the source said.
There has since been suggestions the word “Australia” may also be excluded from the new name, to encourage the channel’s growing international audience to stick around.
Was Sharri right all along?
Here at On Background, we have something of a mea culpa to offer. It seems this column may have accidentally contributed to the inception of this week’s dominant political story.
Last week, we brought you the definitive numbers behind Sharri Markson’s prolonged snubbing of right-wing agitators One Nation amid an otherwise station wide love-in.
Maybe we struck a nerve, or maybe the bosses gave Markson a friendly nudge because on the very next show, last Monday, who appeared as the star guest? Pauline Hanson.
The move appears to have vindicated Sharri’s initial judgment, though, as Hanson proceeded to issue racially charged remarks about Muslims.
“You say, oh, well, there’s good Muslims out there,” Hanson said. “Well, I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?”
While the comments were hardly a surprise, considering the last time Markson hosted Hanson was after she wore a burqa into the Senate (for the second time), the latest comments were so bad that after the interview, the host took time to tell viewers “as an Australian Jew, I don’t support what Pauline Hanson just said”.
Ray Hadley, Markson’s next guest, urged the One Nation leader to apologise. Later, Matt Canavan did the same and even new One Nation recruit Barnaby Joyce didn’t back up Hanson’s words. Yikes.
Hanson partially walked back her comments on Wednesday before essentially retracting the quasi-apology.
“And I am not going to apologise … I will have my say now before it’s too late,” she said.
Pretty awful stuff all around. Good thing Sky doesn’t hold a grudge, though. Hanson was back on Sky on Wednesday night. And guess what? On Background has confirmed she and her One Nation crew even received an invitation to their big bash as well.
Markson was approached for comment.
Costello: Back in the game
A week is a long time in modern media, what with the 24-hour news cycle and all that.
But still, it’s been less than a year since former A Current Affair reporter Seb Costello exited Nine, following a review into how he ended up chasing a male interview subject into some women’s toilets, and he’s already back on his feet.
It was the second Nine exit for a Costello to make headlines in less than 12 months, after his father, former federal treasurer and then-company chairman Peter Costello stepped down days after an altercation with a reporter for The Australian at Canberra Airport.
Just six weeks after Daily Mail Australia announced a new column under his name, On Background can reveal Costello jnr has been appointed a senior reporter with rival outlet the Herald Sun.
Editor Sam Weir officially announced the appointment internally on Thursday after Costello’s byline began running in News Corp’s Melbourne tabloid last month as a freelancer. He’d already filed a front page story on Monday. But a leftover column from the man the Mail had dubbed “Melbourne’s ultimate insider” still went online at the digital publication a day later.
7.30 job hunt proves a hard slog
It has been more than two months since the ABC announced wunderkind former 7.30 chief Joel Tozer as the new executive producer of its flagship investigative program, Four Corners.
Tozer begins work on Four Corners on Monday. But the talk of the ABC is the fact they still haven’t managed to fill the top 7.30 job he’s set to vacate.
There is word the headhunting process has come up empty-handed so far. Commissioning editor of 7.30 Patricia Drum will be the show’s acting boss in the meantime.
The show has been a breeding ground for talent, on and off-air. The ABC’s current overall news boss Justin Stevens held the show’s executive producer gig before he was appointed to the top job in 2022.
Under Tozer, the show’s nightly average audience rose by 5 per cent to 789,000 in the 2025 financial year, and continues to rate well.
With host Sarah Ferguson not going anywhere and a newly minted political editor in Jacob Greber, it isn’t exactly a product a new boss could play around with.
An ABC spokesperson said: “This is an important role and the ABC is running a thorough and competitive process which is still ongoing, delayed slightly by the timing falling over summer and coverage of major news events.”
Siobhan McKenna, still a Mel-ebrity
Life is probably a lot quieter this year for Siobhan McKenna, Lachlan Murdoch’s former consigliere, fixer and general right hand.
She signed off from her various jobs running his private company Illyria last year, as well as her role as chief executive of broadcasting for News Corp Australia, which by the end mainly just meant being chair of Sky News. It is probably a relief she doesn’t have to attend any more Sky events, having been referred to by one friend as a “teal” with heavy Labor-links in a profile by this masthead in October.
But it seems McKenna still has time to stay connected. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan’s diary entries show McKenna is one of a crack team of Mel-ebrities on the organising committee for this year’s Melbourne NFL Game. There is plenty of pressure to get the big game right, as only a lucky few cities are handed one by the powerhouse US football code to show off their stars abroad.
McKenna did not respond to a request for comment.
Alongside McKenna in the team, there is also Lord Mayor Nick Reece, AFL boss Andrew Dillon, Eddie McGuire (of course) and local Disney boss and Western Bulldogs president Kylie Watson-Wheeler among others.
Allan’s diaries also show News Corp’s Thomson still holds some love for his home state. He found time in December for a cup of tea with the premier alongside News Corp powerbroker and Rupert Murdoch’s niece, Penny Fowler, at the Herald & Weekly Times offices in Southbank.
As it is with News Corp, the pollies always come to them.

Plan to protect children from toxic metals erased from NSW government report

Plan to protect children from toxic metals erased from NSW government report
A draft proposal to relocate childcare centres, playgrounds and schools at high risk of toxic metal exposure was one of several recommendations removed from an independent report into lead contamination in Broken Hill, new documents reveal.
NSW Chief Scientist Hugh Durrant-Whyte on Thursday published his agency’s report into the health and environmental impacts of lead contamination in Broken Hill, the mining town 14 hours west of Sydney, built on one of the world’s largest deposits of silver, zinc and lead.
Durrant-Whyte said lowering dangerously high levels of lead in the blood of Broken Hill’s children was “an urgent public health priority”, after finding progress on the issue had slowed and many historical recommendations were yet to be implemented.
“The purpose of this report is not to delay progress but to realign current efforts toward minimising community exposure to lead, particularly in children,” he wrote. “The development window from birth to five years old is critical and delays in effective intervention risks irreversible impairment and potential lifelong complications to successive generations.”
Three of the seven recommendations initially proposed by Durrant-Whyte’s office did not make the final report, drafts of the document made public through a parliamentary call for papers reveal.
One of the recommendations, contained in an October draft, suggested developing a detailed map to “identify and visualise contamination hotspots”. This data could be used to guide planning decisions around remediation and possible relocation of high-risk facilities “such as childcare centres, schools and public play areas from zones of elevated lead exposure”.
In 2023, two of three preschools in the town had lead levels above the threshold for intervention, according to data published in the draft report.
A sixth recommendation, also removed from the final report, suggested conducting a cost-benefit analysis of dust-reduction strategies such as street sweepers and revegetation.
The final recommendation in the October draft proposed seeking additional funding from alternative government programs such as the Commonwealth’s Closing the Gap measures or the NSW social housing energy performance initiative.
Emails from March last year show funding for Broken Hill’s lead program was under strain. The program had fallen outside the priority projects being taken to the Expenditure Review Committee “as their allocation has been exhausted”.
In reply, one public servant warned it would be challenging for the community if the program were “not funded and momentum is lost”.
‘There’s virtually zero interest from the NSW government in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal children in Broken Hill ... [It is] a waste of time really.’Richard Weston, chief executive of Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation
Emails from November 6 show the Office of the Chief Scientist and Engineer (OCSE) invited bureaucrats from NSW Health, the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA), and the premier’s department to a confidential briefing the next week.
The bureaucrats were told the briefing would “not be open to editorial commentary” and only minor adjustments may occur before the final publication of the report.
The parliamentary documents include a November media request from the Herald asking the chief scientist when the report would be published, which was escalated to the premier’s department for approval.
The report was due to be submitted to the premier’s department and published in December but was not made public until Thursday, shortly after the Herald sent questions about the drafts and why the publication had been delayed by two months.
The OCSE declined to respond to questions, stating they did not comment on published reports.
A spokesperson for the premier’s department said they did not request changes to the report’s recommendations.
The department will now consider the chief scientist’s recommendations, including a $2.5 million proposal to conduct further investigations until December, the spokesperson said. “A response will be confirmed in due course.”
The government’s response to the issue has caused frustration in the town’s Indigenous community.
Durrant-Whyte’s report noted that Aboriginal children in Broken Hill were disproportionately affected by lead contamination, with much higher lead exposure risk compared to the general population.
Half of all government-owned homes for Indigenous families had high levels of lead, and 23 per cent were at very high risk from lead contamination, the report said.
Maari Ma Health Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Richard Weston said the Indigenous health service withdrew from the Broken Hill Environmental Lead Response Group in November in protest at the government’s inaction.
“There’s virtually zero interest from the NSW government in the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal children in Broken Hill,” Weston said. “[It is] a waste of time, really.”
An earlier draft from October said Broken Hill was a case study for what can happen with mining elsewhere, “including Mudgee”, where a new silver, zinc and lead mine was approved in 2023.
Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, who requested the documents, described the final report as “politically palatable” for Premier Chris Minns.
“The people of Broken Hill have the right to be very angry at the government,” she said. “They just refuse to do what’s necessary to keep the kids of Broken Hill safe.”

The Victorian town where home buyers splashed the most cash last year
By Emily Power
Mildura is more famous for oranges than auctions, but the city in Australia’s food bowl is the new epicentre of real estate spending.
The agricultural city, which also has a flourishing tourism and culinary scene, is the location where the most money was spent on houses in regional Victoria in the 12 months to last September, Cotality data shows.
The regional suburb of Mildura had 821 house sales, for a total transaction value of $418,459,341, according to the Cotality Best of the Best 2025 report.
The second most active and lucrative market was Torquay, which had 303 sales resulting in $389,022,040 worth of deals.
Also in the top five were Ocean Grove (352 sales, $388,189,982 total value), Shepparton (755 sales, $369,172,002 total value) and Warrnambool (545 sales, $345,491,388 total value).
Mildura’s low median and multi-pronged economy, across healthcare, farming, hospitality and tourism, has been a magnet for investors and owner-occupiers alike. “It’s really been a story about affordability and opportunity driving that particularly strong growth that we’ve seen,” Cotality’s head of research Gerard Burg says.
The border city also has one of Australia’s sunniest climates. Locals like to quip that it has more hours of blue sky than the Gold Coast. “Mildura is quite an attractive place to move to,” Burg says.
Mildura attracts foodies to establishments such as Stefano’s Restaurant, which consistently wins Good Food Guide accolades. But investors’ appetites are strong, too.
Cotality’s median rental yield in Melbourne is 3.6 per cent, compared to Mildura’s 4.7 per cent. “Investors who can get into the market at a lower value are getting a higher rate of return,” Burg says.
However, the federal government has not ruled out cutting the capital gains discount for investors, and the ongoing debate could affect confidence in markets such as Mildura. “The speculation at the minute that we could see a shift in the capital gains discounts for investors, and that sort of uncertainty might make people wary of buying,” Burg says.
Mildura is typical of the tree-change destinations that welcomed new residents during COVID, but limited stock has since sustained demand. “What we’ve seen over that period is a slowing trend in the number of houses or dwellings that have been listed for sale,” Burg says.
Average days on market in Mildura have also fallen from 30 days to about 20 days.
Mildura’s rise comes after fluctuations in previous reports. It had the fifth-highest total house transactions in regional Victoria in 2024, third in 2023, fell off the list in 2022, and was fifth in 2021.
Founder of One Agency Mildura, Mark Thornton, says when he launched his business in 2021, Mildura’s market was known for its consistency, but not large gains. That has changed. “In the last two years, we’ve seen nothing but extraordinary growth,” he says.
The median house value in Mildura has spiked 20.1 per cent over 12 months, according to Cotality.
Thornton says homes priced about $600,000 are most popular. Two years ago, he says those same properties were trading for about $150,000 less. “When I tell these home owners what their houses are worth, they are surprised.”
Town residents are using equity to upgrade to premium acreage on the outskirts, Thornton says.
Mildura’s performance indicates proximity to a capital city (it’s roughly 400 kilometres to Adelaide and 550 kilometres to Melbourne) is not essential. “We have a diversity of industry, projected population growth and an airport,” Thornton says. “We stand on our own two feet. People drive through hundreds of kilometres of nothing and then they get to Mildura, and it is like a big, green tourism oasis.”
While Mildura’s isolation plays in its favour, Torquay and Ocean Grove are “realistically commutable” for Melbourne workers, Burg explains. With seven-figure medians, these coastal havens are attracting aspirational buyers.
Tim Carson, director of Torquay-based McCartney Real Estate, has noticed home owners in Geelong’s growth corridor suburbs of Armstrong Creek and Warralily are upsizing in Torquay. “They are selling their homes for $600,000 to $900,000, and coming to Torquay to buy from $900,000 up to $1.2 million.”
There has been a knock-on effect, as those vendors pour their gain into a higher-end Torquay property, worth up to $1.5 million. “That’s where we’ve really seen growth,” Carson says.
Overall days on market have shortened, Carson says, but that is owner-occupier driven. Other segments have been stung by the state’s land and vacancy taxes. “Most of our buyers are definitely owner-occupier,” he says. “Investors and the holiday home people have gone out of the market, even though there is a shortage of rentals here and the yield is getting better.”

No good Muslims? Pauline Hanson has removed her racism fig leaf and mulched it

No good Muslims? Pauline Hanson has removed her racism fig leaf and mulched it
Until now, most commentary on the One Nation surge has been about the effect this would have on the Coalition. That’s fair enough given it’s overwhelmingly a story of Coalition voter flight, and it is therefore the Coalition that must respond. But we’ve thought less about the effect this might have on One Nation. It’s never been here before. And we’ve never seen how a pitched battle for conservative major party status might look.
This week, we might have had our first glimpse. It began on Monday night when Pauline Hanson asked rhetorically, incredulously, “I’m sorry, how can you tell me there are good Muslims?” She wasn’t sorry, of course. At least not until a couple of days later when – having previously dug in – she conceded she didn’t “genuinely believe” what she said. She cited at least one good Muslim: the non-practising Muslim woman who stood as a One Nation candidate. She apologised to certain kinds of good Muslims “if” they were “out there”, but somehow still did it defiantly: it’s the only apology I’ve encountered that includes the words “and I am not going to apologise”.
It’s true, this wasn’t a huge departure from what Hanson has always said. Going into the 2016 election, she’d called for a royal commission into Islam. A year later, she declared “Islam is a disease, we need to vaccinate ourselves against that.” Her maiden Senate speech dismissed the idea of embracing “good Muslims”: “How should we tell the difference? … How many lives will be lost or destroyed trying to determine who is good and who is bad?” With this in mind, she’s consistently called for an end to Muslim migration, though in 2007 she said she didn’t have a problem with “Christian Muslims”.
But note the (very) subtle difference. Until this point, Hanson hasn’t disputed the existence of “good Muslims” in theory. She’s argued they’re too hard to identify in practice, or reduced them to a literal contradiction in terms. But this week she just came out and said it: they don’t exist; every Muslim you see, hear from, hear about, is an enemy of Australia. She’s taken the fig leaf and mulched it.
Perhaps this was an accident. Perhaps Hanson suddenly found herself in the middle of a sentence she hadn’t intended to say, but was then committed. More likely, though, she felt perfectly ready to make this statement; to expand the frontiers of a sordid debate.
When Angus Taylor deposed Sussan Ley as Liberal leader last week, two things happened. A poll showed a bump in the Coalition vote at the expense of One Nation. And Taylor framed his leadership around stopping “bad migration”, which he would do by discriminating against applicants “based on values”. “No one will ever be as strong as One Nation on immigration,” retorted Hanson in a flash, challenging him to restrict immigration from “fundamentalist Islamic countries”. Then, on Monday, came a leaked Liberal immigration policy, ostensibly developed under Sussan Ley’s leadership, which sounded very much like a Trumpian version of doing exactly that: banning entry to anyone coming from nominated regions within 13 nations, including Palestine and Somalia, and instituting phone searches at the border to inspect people’s views.
Senior Liberals disowned it, and Taylor dismissed it. But in this sequence of events lurks the ghost of a bidding war. Taylor, clearly worried about One Nation as most Coalition members are, signals he’ll be tough on the politics of culture. Hanson goads the new Coalition leader to put up and declares herself tougher. Then, with the first sign of a modest Coalition recovery, she goes and proves it. If that’s close to the truth, the story is not merely about the possibility of the Coalition moving to the right. It’s about One Nation moving even further that way, too.
That is why what came next is so significant. “It’s just wrong and it’s insulting,” boomed Nationals senator for Queensland Matt Canavan, who will be competing directly with Hanson on the ballot. “There are 800,000 Muslims – most of them are great people. It’s a ridiculous statement; Pauline should just say sorry. Just own it and admit it.” Elsewhere, he called it “totally un-Australian”. “These remarks from One Nation are absolutely disgusting and outrageous,” echoed Liberal senator Andrew Bragg.
Then came the true thrust of the response. “It is these kinds of ill-disciplined comments that make people worry that Pauline just doesn’t have what it takes to lead a major party,” added Canavan. And then Bragg: “Leadership is not about bashing up on diverse groups in our community.” That is, they decided to draw a line. Then they used that line to sketch Hanson as a pretender, incapable of anything serious. In doing that, they got some version of a backdown.
That approach might just work. An intriguing survey this week showed that of those supporting One Nation, only 17 per cent nominated border control and reduced immigration as their motivation. The dominant reason, accounting for 36 per cent, is a “desire for an alternative” and a “rejection of the major parties”. That sketches more a protest vote than an affirmation of anything particular One Nation is selling. You might even say the appeal is aesthetic.
The Coalition can’t disrupt that aesthetic by being a facsimile of it. The disruption is to redraw Hanson as unserious, and to explain how that shows up in the policy that those flirting with One Nation aren’t focusing on. Not so much to disrespect her, as to respect yourself enough to know you shouldn’t be following her down burrows. That in doing so, you’ll eventually find one of them is dug all the way to the edge of a cliff. And if you’re not careful, the whole country might fall through it.

Three cars lurked in Balga’s bushland the night a woman was murdered

Three cars lurked in Balga’s bushland the night a woman was murdered
John Napier-Winch remembers in vivid detail a late evening in October, 1974.
He and his wife had been driving home from their parents house in Girrawheen about midnight with their sleeping children, through the backstreets of Balga.
Napier-Winch remembers how still and eerie it was when he slowed his car to a crawl on the dimly lit Balga Avenue and saw a car parked near the bushland.
The car stood out on the dark street, with all four doors ajar and its interior lit up.
“I remember ... because it was parked in a funny place,” Napier-Winch told this masthead.
The spot on Balga Avenue had no houses bordering it, and was practically enveloped in bush. There were no driveways, and the nearest sign of life at midnight would have been the nearby Malthouse Tavern.
“The doors were open, and the lights were on … but there was no one around,” Napier-Winch said.
His first thought was someone had crashed their car and gone to get help. But a quick look around revealed there was no damage to the exterior at all, and it appeared to be running fine. The odd thing, Napier-Winch said, was that no one was there.
It was only days later he realised what he and his family may have just stumbled across.
This week, WAtoday has brought you the story of Gwenneth Graham’s murder, which remains unsolved after five decades. The first two parts of this series were published on Monday and Wednesday. This is part three.
The missing window
Gwenneth Graham was murdered in September 1974.
She was last seen at the Malthouse Tavern in Balga, the evening before the WAFL grand final.
A bartender called a taxi for her, but it’s not known whether she ever got in, accepted a lift or attempted to walk to her house which was about two kilometres away. She never made it home.
Gwen was found murdered in Balga’s bushland nine days later, inexpertly concealed under some leaf litter and an old refrigerator. She had been bashed, strangled and sexually assaulted.
Napier-Winch remembers reading the paper the day after her body had been found, and realising he and his family had likely only been metres from the dead mother-of-two.
“We thought, ‘That’s the same location we saw the car’,” he said.
“We ran to the police, and they came out [to the house], and I described to them the exact make and year of that car.”
Related Article
More than 50 years on, Napier-Winch and his wife find it difficult to place when exactly they had come across the car parked on Balga Avenue, but place it only days before Graham’s body was discovered.
As an avid car fan, Napier-Winch was able to recall the vehicle down to minute details – it was a Ford Valiant, he said, with a swapped-out boot lid that appeared to be chrome. It had a spoiler at the rear that didn’t match the rest of its body.
“It means one of two things – they changed the boot, or they just put on a fancy chrome lid that came off another model,” he said.
“We gave police all the details, but we don’t know what they did with it.”
Muddying the waters
Identifying the cars became a primary focus of detectives, particularly due to the last sighting of Graham taking place in a pub’s carpark.
Police released details of a number of cars and implored their drivers to come forward so they could eliminate them from the investigation, and ended up going through about 4000 separate vehicles.
However, three went unclaimed.
They included a Holden station wagon and two separate Valiants that had been seen in the time frame narrowed down by police: between 11.30pm, when Gwen was last seen, and 10am the next day when locals remembered seeing some discarded shoes on Redcliffe Avenue.
For officers, it was tough sorting out fact from distraction.
The Valiants
There were reports relating to two Valiants that had been seen in the Balga area on the night of Graham’s murder.
A 16-year-old boy said he heard the voices of a man and woman coming from a green sedan parked on Balga Avenue around 11.30pm.
The witness told police at the time he heard the man demand a “perverted sex act” from the woman, and “threats to kill if the other person did not do as he asked”.
Witnesses said they also saw a car of the same make but in a light colour parked on the verge of Balga Avenue about the 11.40pm.
In an account that matches the one Napier-Winch gave in 2025, witnesses said they too came across the car parked up near the bush with all its interior lights on – but there was no driver.
The witnesses said they drove past again about half an hour later, and saw a man get into the car and slide across the front bench seat towards the driver’s side.
The man looked to be aged between 28 and 35, about 5′10 with a thin build, and was in a light-coloured, long-sleeved shirt with medium-length curly, dark hair. It would later emerge the car was seen extremely close to where Graham’s body was eventually found.
On interrogating the statements, police were unable to rule either vehicle in or out and neither car nor driver were ever located.
Teen comes forward
However, it wasn’t long before one car emerged as an interest to detectives.
A WA police gazette from 1974 recalled what a witness told officers about what he saw in Balga on the evening of September 27.
“About 11.30pm a 15-year-old youth observed a white woman being forced into the front passenger seat of a 1964 model (Holden) station sedan, bluish/green colour, with a white top. The vehicle may have a roof rack, but this is not certain,” it reads.
While this was set out in the gazette, a vintage car expert told this masthead the year was likely inaccurate, given the Holden model identified was only built from February 1965 to April 1966, making it unlikely it was a 1964 car.
“The youth described the person who pushed the woman into this vehicle as a part Aboriginal man about 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in, stocky build, black hair, wearing a white shirt with sleeves rolled up and dark trousers,” the police gazette read.
“His age is not known but he has an untidy appearance. He then hurried around the front of the car, entered the vehicle and drove off in the direction of Balga Avenue.”

The car was again spotted just about 1am the next morning, near where Graham’s body was found.
But neither the driver nor the car were never located.
A taxi driver’s account
Police experienced a further headache when a taxi driver came forward and told them he had picked up a “part-Aboriginal man” and a woman matching Graham’s description from the Malthouse Tavern on the night of September 27.
The driver said he had been parked at the taxi rank outside the pub when a man approached him and got in the passenger seat.
The driver described his passenger as a “casually dressed” and “well-spoken”, and claimed he directed him towards a woman who appeared drunk, sitting nearby behind the local service station.
The driver said the woman claimed to have hurt her ankle – he said he wasn’t sure if she was feigning or if was a real injury – and accepted a lift.
He said she was carrying two bottles of beer, and was wearing a white cardigan and a skirt when he dropped them at a house in Balga.
While he was unable to tell police which house he took them to, he said he did remember the man pulling the woman from the car and the exact fare he paid.
As detectives sought to check, verify and exclude all the claims surrounding the cars that evening, sorting fact from fiction was proving difficult.
“Extensive enquiries have failed to trace those vehicles or the persons referred to,” the police gazette said.
One thing police knew for sure is that Graham was not en route to her house when she left the pub that night.
Her home on Felpham Avenue was in the opposite direction of where her body had been found, making it more and more likely she had been in a car before her death.
But with all the car sightings seemingly leading to dead ends, detectives had to ask other questions. Had she noticed mid-drive they were not going in the direction of her house? Had she said something? What about the reports she got in an argument the night of her murder?
And why was her murder so similar to one that happened months earlier a few kilometres away?

RSF siege of El Fasher in Sudan has ‘hallmarks of genocide’, UN mission finds

The siege and capture of the Sudanese city of El Fasher by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group last October bore “the hallmarks of genocide”, a UN-mandated fact-finding mission has said.
In a report detailing the harrowing 18-month occupation of the capital of North Darfur, investigators concluded that the RSF and allied militias deliberately inflicted conditions calculated to bring about the physical destruction of the Zaghawa and Fur ethnic communities.
“The scale, coordination, and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war,” said Mohamed Chande Othman, the mission’s chair, who called for a thorough investigation of the perpetrators.
The report was published a day after the UK, Canada and the European Union denounced possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan during the nearly three-year war.
Its release coincides with the latest wave of drone strikes that have left dozens dead across Sudan’s Kordofan region, an area where the UN has consistently said that grave abuses are taking place.
Unicef said at least 15 children were killed this week when a drone struck a displacement camp in West Kordofan. Local rights defenders reported that another strike on a market in nearby North Kordofan left 28 people dead. Blame for the West Kordofan attack has been directed at the Sudanese army; while the RSF has been accused of carrying out the strike in North Kordofan.
Since April 2023, the RSF has been waging war against the army after a falling out between its commander, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, and the army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, former allies who came to power after the 2019 Sudanese revolution ousted longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.
The RSF has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, a position the Gulf state denies despite evidence compiled by the UN, independent experts and reporters.
The group grew out of the Janjaweed militias, notorious for atrocities committed in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign in Darfur that killed 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.
The war, the latest crisis in Sudan’s history of violence, has forced 11 million people to flee their homes and killed tens of thousands, triggering what the UN calls one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
The fact-finding report said that after the seizure of El Fasher, the RSF inflicted “three days of absolute horror” and that thousands of people, particularly from the Zaghawa ethnic group, were killed, raped or disappeared.
Othman said: “The scale, coordination and public endorsement of the operation by senior RSF leadership demonstrate that the crimes committed in and around El Fasher were not random excesses of war. They formed part of a planned and organised operation that bears the defining characteristics of genocide.”
Investigators said RSF militiamen had acted with impunity and “with genocidal intent” and that as conflict’s focus shifts from Darfur to Kordofan, outside countries must act decisively to hold perpetrators to account “and bring an end to this senseless violence”.
The mission interviewed 320 witnesses and victims from El Fasher and the surrounding areas, including in investigative visits to Chad and South Sudan. It authenticated, verified and corroborated 25 videos.
The report documents widespread sexual violence against girls and women aged seven to 70, including those who were pregnant. Survivors said they were attacked in front of family members, with the assaults often involving severe physical abuse.
In one incident, a 12-year-old girl was raped by three RSF fighters as her mother watched, moments after her father was killed while trying to shield her. The girl later died from her injuries.
According to the findings, such assaults frequently occurred at the same locations where mass killings had taken place, including El Saudi hospital and El Fasher University. Witnesses said RSF fighters also carried out public gang rapes of at least 19 women in rooms strewn with corpses, among them the bodies of the victims’ husbands.
On Thursday the US announced that it was placing sanctions on three RSF commanders over their roles in the siege and capture of El Fasher. The US Treasury said the RSF had carried out “ethnic killings, torture, starvation, and sexual violence” in the operation.

France to provide EUR 71M in grant support, part of which will go to energy sector – Shmyhal
This was agreed during a meeting between First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine and Minister of Energy Denys Shmyhal and France's Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry, Energy and Digital Sovereignty Roland Lescure, Ukrinform reports, citing Shmyhal's post on Telegram.
The parties also signed a document on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
Shmyhal expressed gratitude to the French government for its support, in particular for the decision to deliver an additional 150 generators to Ukraine during February.
He recalled that Ukraine has already received more than 50 shipments of humanitarian energy aid from France, including over 140 high-capacity generators. An additional EUR 5.7 million was contributed by France to the Energy Support Fund.
Ukraine and France are also implementing three infrastructure projects aimed at strengthening the resilience of regional energy systems.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Denys Shmyhal held a series of bilateral meetings with international partners during a working visit to France, where he is participating in a meeting of the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Les Wexner: How the billionaire enabled Jeffrey Epstein’s rise
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak received Wexner Foundation funds. Years later, he partnered with convicted US sex offender Epstein.
In a closed-door session at his Ohio home on Wednesday, billionaire Leslie Wexner faced mounting questions from United States lawmakers about Jeffrey Epstein’s rise to wealth and influence – and the role he may have played in that ascent.
Five members of the House Oversight Committee had travelled to depose the 88-year-old after Democrats subpoenaed him in the wake of the latest US Department of Justice release tied to Epstein.

The latest tranche of documents, published by the Justice Department on January 30, 2026, is part of a vast wealth of materials amassed during federal investigations into Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to procuring a minor for prostitution and was later charged in 2019 with sex trafficking of minors before his death by suicide in federal custody. Wexner’s name appears, both redacted and unredacted, on communications and financial documents within these files.
“I was naive, foolish, and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,” Wexner said in a statement. “He was a con man. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.”
For decades, Epstein cultivated relationships with business leaders, politicians and academics.
Central among them was Wexner, the founder of L Brands, the retail empire behind Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and The Limited, whose fortune helped build the foundations for Epstein’s access to global elites, including former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
The newly released files shed fresh light on how deeply Epstein embedded himself within Wexner’s financial and philanthropic world, a relationship that proved pivotal in transforming him from an obscure money manager into a figure of extraordinary wealth and influence.
Epstein and Wexner’s townhouse
Epstein was introduced to Wexner in the mid-1980s. At the time, Epstein was a college dropout who had briefly taught at Manhattan’s elite Dalton School after reportedly exaggerating his academic credentials. He had passed through Bear Stearns under executive Alan “Ace” Greenberg before leaving to set up his own advisory firm.
By 1986, he had met Wexner. Five years later, the retail billionaire had granted him full power of attorney, an extraordinary delegation allowing Epstein to sign cheques, hire staff, borrow money, and buy or sell property on Wexner’s behalf.
Al Jazeera has reviewed newly released Justice Department records, including a 1998 purchase and sale agreement and related promissory note and guaranty, which detail the mechanics of asset transfers between the two men.
The documents show how control of Wexner’s Manhattan townhouse at 9 East 71st Street was formalised through a structured transaction involving a $10m promissory note and a personal guaranty signed by Epstein. The property became Epstein’s New York base and a symbol of his growing stature.
By the early 1990s, Epstein was embedded in Wexner’s philanthropic and corporate world, serving as a trustee of the Wexner Foundation and as the president of Wexner-affiliated property companies. In 1996, he relocated his firm to the US Virgin Islands, positioning himself as an offshore financier.
The authority Wexner granted him over assets, philanthropy and property did more than elevate his status socially. It conferred institutional legitimacy. With control over substantial wealth and formal roles inside a major foundation, Epstein could present himself as a financier with access to capital and global networks.
The Wexner Foundation and the Israel connection
One of the clearest through-lines from that period runs to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who was introduced to Epstein by former Israeli President Shimon Peres at a large event in Washington in 2003.
Between 2004 and 2006, the Wexner Foundation paid Barak approximately $2.3m for two commissioned research studies, one on leadership and another on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The foundation later said only one paper was completed, but determined that the work justified the payment.
Barak, who served as Israel’s prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and later as defence minister from 2007 to 2013, maintained contact with Epstein for several years.
A court filing included in the newly released Epstein records contains an allegation that prominent victim Virginia Giuffre claimed that Wexner and Barak were two of the men Epstein trafficked her to.
The filing does not provide supporting evidence for the claim. Neither man has been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.
In February this year, Barak told Israel’s Channel 12 he had been unaware of the full scope of Epstein’s crimes and regretted ever meeting the financier.
Wexner has said he severed ties with Epstein around 2007 after he discovered the financier had “misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family”.
But the financial and institutional credibility Epstein accumulated during his years managing Wexner’s wealth did not evaporate when that relationship ended.
Epstein ‘editing’ Barak’s op-ed
Even after his relationship allegedly ended with Wexner, Epstein now had the social prestige, and money, to develop ties with powerful decision-makers, emails newly released by the Justice Department and reviewed by Al Jazeera show.
In October 2014, Nili Priel Barak – Barak’s wife – wrote to Epstein about travel plans to New York, suggesting dates when Ehud Barak would be in town and asking whether he would be available to meet.
Days later, she forwarded him a draft opinion piece, writing: “Herewith the Op Ed. Please let me know your opinion and your remarks. Thanks.”
Epstein replied with what he labelled “beginning edits”, returning a version of the unpublished article. The draft speaks in Barak’s political voice, including the line: “As the Minister of Defence of Israel I’ve met more than once with [US] President [Barack] Obama…” and lays out arguments about the “two states solution” versus a “one state solution”.
A year later, in 2015, Epstein invested in Reporty Homeland Security, later rebranded as Carbyne, a startup chaired by Ehud Barak that developed advanced emergency communications technology – further tying their political relationship to a shared commercial venture.
The company’s leadership included CEO Amir Elichai, a former special forces officer, and director Pinhas Buchris, a former Israeli Defence Ministry director-general and former commander of Unit 8200, the Israeli military’s cyber intelligence unit.
Between 2012 and 2014, documents reportedly indicate Epstein also assisted Barak in exploring security-related business with African world leaders. The documents illustrate how Epstein managed to convert financial credibility into political access, and then reinforced those relationships through shared commercial ventures.
Barak has said: “I am responsible for all my actions and decisions. There is room to question whether I should have investigated more thoroughly. I regret not doing so.”
Wexner has never been charged with any crime and has said he was unaware of Epstein’s criminal conduct. But his name appears repeatedly throughout the newly released files, a reminder of how central their relationship once was.

Gaza relief funds, troops pledged at inaugural Board of Peace meeting

U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace that nine participating members have committed a combined $7 billion for a relief initiative in Gaza and five nations have pledged to contribute troops to an international stabilization force aimed at supporting the war-battered Palestinian territory.
In a flurry of announcements at the end of a long, meandering speech to representatives from nearly 50 nations, Trump said the United States will contribute $10 billion to the Board of Peace. He didn't specify what the money would be used for. It was also not clear where the U.S. money would come from – a sizable pledge that would need to be authorized by Congress.
The Board of Peace includes Israel but not Palestinian representatives.
Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have pledged to send troops for a Gaza stabilization force, while Egypt and Jordan have committed to train police. Troops will initially be deployed to Rafah, a major population center where the U.S. administration hopes to first focus reconstruction efforts.
The countries making pledges are Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait, Trump said.
Trump said FIFA will raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza and that the United Nations will chip in $2 billion for humanitarian assistance.
"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious (region)," Trump said in thanking the donors. He added, "The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built right here in this room."
The dollars pledged, while significant, represent a small fraction of the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild the Palestinian territory decimated after two years of Israel's genocidal war.
Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the leader of the newly created International Stabilization Force, said the plans call for 12,000 police and 20,000 soldiers for Gaza. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced his country would contribute up to 8,000 troops to the force.
"With these first steps, we help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace," Jeffers said.
The board was initiated as part of Trump's 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza.
But since the October cease-fire, Trump's vision for the board has morphed and he wants it to have an even more ambitious remit – one that will not only complete the Herculean task of bringing lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinian resistance group Hamas but will also help resolve conflicts around the globe.
But the Gaza cease-fire deal remains fragile and Trump's expanded vision for the board has triggered fears the U.S. president is looking to create a rival to the United Nations.
Trump, pushing back against the criticism, said the creation of his board would help make the U.N. viable in the future.
"Someday I won't be here. The United Nations will be," Trump said. "I think it is going to be much stronger, and the Board of Peace is going to almost be looking over the United Nations and making sure it runs properly."
Even as Trump spoke of the gathering as a triumph that would help bring a more persistent peace to the Middle East, he sent new warnings to Iran.
Tensions are high between the United States and Iran as Trump has ordered one of the largest U.S. military buildups in the region in decades.
One aircraft carrier group is already in the region and another is on the way. Trump has warned Tehran it will face American military action if it does not denuclearize, give up ballistic missiles and halt funding to extremist groups.
Trump said he should know in 10 days whether a deal is possible to end a standoff with Tehran.
"We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen," he said.
Nearly 50 countries and the European Union sent officials to Thursday's meeting. Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are among more than a dozen countries that have not joined the board, but that took part as observers.
Most countries sent high-level officials, but a few leaders – including Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, Argentine President Javier Milei and Hungarian President Viktor Orban – traveled to Washington for the gathering.
"Almost everybody's accepted, and the ones that haven't, will be," Trump offered. "And some are playing a little cute – it doesn't work. You can't play cute with me."
The U.N. Security Council held a high-level meeting on Wednesday on the cease-fire deal and Israel's efforts to expand control in the occupied West Bank.
The U.N. session in New York was originally scheduled for Thursday but was moved up after Trump announced the board's meeting for the same date and it became clear that it would complicate travel plans for diplomats planning to attend both.
Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin told reporters earlier this week that "at the international level it should above all be the U.N. that manages these crisis situations."
Official after official used their speaking turns to heap praise on Trump for his ability to end conflicts around the world. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called him the "savior of South Asia," while others said that years of U.S. foreign policy efforts by his predecessor failed to do what Trump has done in the past year.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Trump and others gathered for the meeting deserved thanks for their collective efforts on Gaza. But Fidan, who said Türkiye was also prepared to contribute troops to the stabilization force, cautioned that the situation remains precarious.
"The humanitarian situation remains fragile and cease-fire violations continue to occur," Fidan said. "A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential."
Fidan said President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan "remains fully" committed to ensuring the stability of Gaza, while noting that Türkiye could offer significant support in rebuilding the enclave's health and education sectors, as well as training a new police force.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged there is a "long ways to go" in Gaza.
"There's a lot of work that remains that will require the contribution of every nation state represented here today," Rubio added.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must "monitor the cease-fire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression."
Hamas says it is ready to hand over to a U.S.-backed committee of Palestinian technocrats led by Ali Shaath.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian with a senior role in the Board of Peace, said at the meeting that 2,000 Palestinians have applied to join a new transitional Palestinian police force.

No, this video does not prove Israel used a thermobaric bomb in Gaza
Social media users have shared footage of a spectacular explosion that they claim proves the Israeli military is using a highly lethal new weapon in Gaza: a thermobaric bomb. However, the footage has been taken out of context; it actually depicts a conventional explosion.
A spectacular shockwave followed by a massive plume of black smoke. A video viewed more than 8 million times on X reportedly reveals Israel's use of "thermobaric and pressure bombs" in Gaza. The post was shared by China Pulse, a pro-Beijing account which was recently flagged for spreading disinformation.
"These bombs, which burn at a temperature of 3,500 degrees Celsius, are capable of killing thousands in seconds, leaving no trace," the post reads.

Controlled explosion
The FRANCE 24 Observers team had already worked on this video in November 2025. At the time, online users were claiming that the video was showing the explosion of a "miniature nuclear bomb" in Gaza.
Our team spoke with several experts and found that the footage actually shows a controlled ground-level explosion using conventional explosives to destroy a tunnel dug by Hamas.
As for the recent allegations, Trevor Ball, a conflict researcher with the online investigative site Bellingcat, said on X that "there's nothing that indicates this is thermobaric".
‘Conventional explosive device’
Gilles Denglos, an explosives expert accredited by the French courts, told our team that the video likely shows a conventional explosive device. "Social media users are talking nonsense. A thermobaric bomb is designed to detonate above the ground, not on it." Denglos said the video shows the explosion of "a significant charge on the ground".
Another weapons expert who spoke to our team on the condition of anonymity also said that the spectacular shockwave visible in the video was the result of a "completely conventional" explosion:
"This phenomenon is a ‘Wilson cloud’: a condensation cloud that can occur when the shockwave from an explosion passes through humid air. This effect occurs regardless of the specific type of explosive used."
The expert further explained: "Thermobaric bombs are weapons whose lethality stems from the combined impact of heat and overpressure [Editor’s note: the bomb’s heat and the resulting shockwave]. This distinguishes them from munitions whose lethality relies on flying metallic fragments, such as conventional high-explosive shells or defensive grenades."
Al Jazeera investigation on Israeli bombs
These allegations against Israel come in the wake of an Al Jazeera investigation published on February 10, which claims the Israeli forces deployed “thermal” and "thermobaric" weapons in Gaza. According to the report, the intensity of the strikes "made thousands of Palestinians evaporate".
The investigation indicates that the Civil Defence agency in Gaza, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, has documented 2,842 Palestinians who have "evaporated" since the war began.
However, the Israeli military's alleged use of thermobaric bombs in Gaza remains a subject of debate.
According to the fact-checking outlet Snopes, which reviewed Al Jazeera’s investigation, it is currently impossible to independently verify the use of such weapons based on the information available at this stage.
We spoke to Michael Shurkin, programme director at the US consulting firm 14 North Strategies, who said the specific model of thermobaric weapons that could be available to the Israeli military for its bombing operations remains unknown. "There is no evidence that the Israeli army has used thermobaric weapons in Gaza. They may have, or they may not have; Al Jazeera provides no concrete proof," Shurkin told us.
In this investigation, Al Jazeera identifies several types of bombs used by the Israeli army: MK-84 900kg bombs, BLU-109 bunker busters, and GBU-39 glide bombs. According to official military specifications, none of these models currently in the Israeli arsenal are equipped with thermobaric explosives, Trevor Ball indicated on X.
"The aerial bombs mentioned in the Al Jazeera article are all loaded with aluminised explosives – compositions where the addition of aluminium enhances the blast effect by raising the temperature of the resulting combustion gases. However, the use of aluminium is extremely common in explosive devices for artillery, aerial bombs, and naval munitions," noted the weapons expert.
Due to their sheer power, these bombs are indeed capable of disintegrating bodies. However, this is a "common effect" of aerial bombs and not exclusive to thermobaric weapons, the expert said. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has denounced the Israeli military's use of MK-84 bombs in "deliberate" or "indiscriminate" strikes on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in Gaza as a violation of international law.
According to figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and accepted by the Israeli army, 72,045 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as of January 29.

Appointment of Antonia Romeo as head of civil service shows ‘poor judgment’, say former colleagues

Keir Starmer’s decision to appoint Antonia Romeo as the country’s most senior civil servant has prompted dismay among former colleagues who complained about what they considered bullying behaviour when she was a diplomat in New York.
Several people who worked with Romeo at the New York consulate nearly 10 years ago have told the Guardian they are upset by the prime minister’s decision to make her cabinet secretary despite knowing about their complaints.
The allegations from several colleagues were made as part of one formal complaint against Romeo in 2017. That complaint was investigated by a senior diplomat who found that she had a case to answer, but was then dismissed by her line managers at the Cabinet Office, who gave her the all clear.
The complaint has resurfaced in recent days after Simon McDonald, the former lead civil servant at the Foreign Office, urged the prime minister to do more due diligence before making his decision. Starmer put aside those objections on Thursday when he confirmed Romeo’s appointment, making her the first ever female cabinet secretary.
One former complainant said: “It is pretty extraordinary but not exactly out of character for the current No 10. It is just another example of poor judgment, and the elevation of those with questionable integrity despite the concerns raised by ordinary people.”
Another said: “There is a real risk this comes back to bite the prime minister. The many people she bullied and intimidated, most of them women, will now feel failed for a second time. It’s not a good look for the civil service or the government.”
A third complainant said: “Taking shortcuts to make appointments based on special treatment instead of merit and due diligence has already created chaos. This is an indication that problematic leadership decisions will persist.”
Government sources have insisted that the allegations against Romeo should not be counted against her given they are 10 years old and were dismissed at the time by the Cabinet Office.
Starmer defended his decision on Thursday, calling Romeo “an outstanding public servant, with a 25‑year record of delivering for the British people”.
He added: “Antonia has shown she is the right person to drive the government to reform and I look forward to working with her to deliver this period of national renewal.”
Romeo said it was a “huge privilege” to become the head of the civil service.
“The civil service is a great and remarkable institution, which I love,” she said. “We should be known for delivery, efficiency and innovation, working to implement the government’s agenda and meet the challenges the country faces.”
Romeo’s supporters say she is dynamic and willing to break civil service conventions to achieve the government’s goals.
But her critics say she is more focused on promoting herself than the government she works for and that her impatience at more junior staff has sometimes tipped over into bullying.
According to the complaint made in 2017, Romeo told several colleagues she would end or damage their careers after disagreements in the normal course of work.
One allegation says Romeo warned that the refusal by a junior member of staff to comply with a particular request was a “career-limiting move” and “would only happen once”.
Another who disagreed with one of Romeo’s ideas said Romeo told her she “would make sure [that person’s] reputation and career in London suffered”.
Other allegations included in the complaint concerned her financial affairs. They included her decision to get Farrow & Ball to provide more than $100,000 (£74,000) worth of paint to redecorate her residence in return for free publicity, as well as a $250 (£186) expense claim for a taxi to a football match.
The allegations, which were part of one complaint, were all investigated at the time by Tim Hitchens, a former ambassador to Japan, who was flown in to conduct a week-long review.
Hitchens found that she had a case to answer on her management style, but not on her financial affairs. His finding was overturned by the Cabinet Office however, which said she had no case to answer.
Three complainants from the time have contacted the Cabinet Office in recent weeks to raise concerns about her previous behaviour.
Downing Street insisted on Thursday that full vetting had taken place on a previous occasion when she was considered for the job. No 10 said it had consulted the civil service commissioner, Gisela Stuart, who said the full process did not need to be re-run.

Uzbek Mining Giant Defends $200M in Tenders to Secretive Firms, Silent on Other OCCRP Findings
Unknown

A major state-owned company in Uzbekistan has defended the more than $200 million in tenders it awarded to foreign companies that OCCRP found included firms with proxy owners, financial filings that falsely declared they were dormant, and procurement contracts featuring signatures of people who deny signing them.
The statement issued this week by Almalyk Mining Metallurgical Complex (AMMC) follows a joint investigation by OCCRP and Finance Uncovered revealing that in several cases these foreign firms competed against one another for AMMC tenders despite being under common control – and had their true beneficiaries hidden behind apparent straw owners.
AMMC, often described as a “crown jewel” of the Uzbek economy, said in a statement Wednesday that all cited tenders were awarded to the lowest bidder through an automated government procurement system.
“The winners of the tenders/competitions delivered goods in full – in compliance with the quality indicators stipulated in the contract, and, most importantly, within the timeframes specified in the contract – to the plant's warehouses,” the company said, adding that it had conducted an internal probe.
AMMC did not respond to previous questions from OCCRP and Finance Uncovered regarding contracts worth more than $7 million awarded to two U.K.-registered firms, Lemixton Solutions Ltd and Golders Business Ltd, that feature electronic signatures of accounting associates who deny signing the documents. One of them has since reported the matter to British authorities.
The two firms collectively received over $35 million in tenders and sent dozens of shipments of goods to the Uzbek mining giant despite U.K. financial filings stating they were dormant, OCCRP revealed.
The investigation found both firms were under common control but competed against one another for the same AMMC tenders.
Similar patterns were identified in Georgia, where firms that had won tens of millions of dollars in AMMC tenders were purchased for a nominal amount by a South Korean medical coordinator with Uzbek roots and no apparent experience in the mining sector.
Like the U.K.-based tender winners, the Georgian firms did not indicate any economic activity in financial filings during the period in which they were awarded the tenders.
A representative for the U.K. companies said that a single individual controlled both of the firms. The Uzbek, Colombian, and Georgian figures identified in the report did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment.
The findings raise questions about transparency and oversight in one of Uzbekistan’s key industrial sectors, though AMMC maintains that all procurement processes complied with internal and legal requirements.

WASHINGTON, February 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump extended for one year certain sanctions introduced earlier against Russia in connection with the situation in Ukraine, according to the notice posted on the Federal Register, the daily journal of the US government.
The document refers to restrictions against Russia introduced in executive orders of the US President in February 2022, September 2018, and March and December 2014 in respect of Crimea. All these restrictive measures "must continue in effect beyond March 6, 2026," Trump said.
"The actions and policies addressed in these Executive Orders continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States," the US leader said. "Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660," Trump added.

DOHA, February 19. /TASS/. Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev cleared the quarterfinals round of the 2025 Qatar Open tennis tournament in Doha on Thursday, defeating Stefanos Tsistipas of Greece.
The 5th-seeded Rublev, who is playing under a neutral status at the tournament, outplayed his Greek opponent 6-3; 7-6 (7-2). In the semifinals, he awaits the winner of the quarterfinals duel between his countryman Karen Khachanov (7th-seeded) and top-seed Carlos Alcaraz of Spain.
Rublev, 28, is currently ranked 14th in the ATP Rankings list. He has won 17 career ATP singles tournament titles and four more in men’s doubles. Rublev has never made it past the quarterfinals in any Grand Slam.
The Russian tennis player took home the gold at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in mixed doubles (with teammate Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova) and also won the 2021 Davis Cup as part of the Russian national team.
The 2026 Qatar Open Tennis tournament is an ATP-500 event on the organization’s calendar which takes place at the Khalifa International Tennis and Squash complex in Doha, Qatar, between February 16 and 21. The tournament is played on outdoor hard courts. Rublev is the reigning champion.
Russian and Belarusian players’ neutral status at tennis tournaments
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from taking part in international tournaments, citing Moscow's special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC's recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations moved to exclude athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
The International Tennis Federation (ITF) ruled on March 1, 2022, to suspend the membership of the Russian and Belarusian national tennis federations while also canceling all previously scheduled tennis tournaments in the two countries.
On March 14, 2022, the ITF also confirmed its prohibition on the Russian and Belarusian national tennis teams from participating in the 2022 Davis Cup and the 2022 Billie Jean King Cup.

'In a hotspot right now,' Trump says Iran deal clarity coming in 10 days

US President Donald Trump has said that it would soon become clear whether a deal with Iran is possible, warning that Washington may be forced to escalate if negotiations fall short.
"We may have to take it a step further, or we may not," he said at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, adding that the situation would likely become clearer "over the next probably 10 days."
Trump said his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, built a solid working relationship with Iranian representatives and talks were progressing well.
"Iran is a hotspot right now, and they're meeting, and they have a good relationship with the representatives of Iran," he said. "Good talks are being had."
US Vice President JD Vance described talks in Geneva on Tuesday as productive "in some ways," but said Iran was "not yet willing" to engage on Trump's "red lines." Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the atmosphere "more constructive."
Trump acknowledged that reaching a "meaningful agreement" with Tehran had historically proven difficult.
"It's proven to be, over the years, not easy to make a meaningful deal with Iran," he said. "We have to make a meaningful deal. Otherwise, bad things happen."
He urged Tehran to seize the moment. "Now is the time for Iran to join us on a path that will complete what we're doing," said Trump. "If they join us, that'll be great. If they don't join us, that'll be great too, but it'll be a very different path."
The president said Iran "cannot continue to threaten the stability of the entire region" and must reach an agreement.
The remarks come as Washington has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group to the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier also on its way, alongside additional fighter jets.

Jordan Stolz Wins His Third Olympic Medal. In a Surprise Twist, It’s Not Gold

The upset of the Olympics has gone down.
Hold the phone, just a little, on Jordan Stolz.
And say hello to Ning Zhongyan.
The speedskater from China set a new Olympic record in the 1,500-m competition on Wednesday, crossing the finish in 1 min., 41.98 sec. at the Milan Speed Skating Oval. American Jordan Stolz, 21, already a double Olympic champion at these Games and the overwhelming favorite to win this distance, had his shot to best Zhongyan in the final pairing. He’d already set two Olympic records here in Milan. What’s one more?
Skating alongside the reigning 1,500-m world champion, Norway’s Peder Kongshaug—Stolz was recovering from pneumonia at that 2025 race and still finished second—Stolz was 0.37 sec. behind at 300 m. We’d seen Stolz fall behind the pace at the start of the 1,000-m race too, which he won on Feb. 11. “He wins on the speed and on the kick,” Joey Cheek, the 500-m Olympic champion in 2006, told TIME before the race. “No one has the speed and the kick. He's so physically strong, he can absorb so much workload. These are just a set of traits that don't exist in a single person.”

So no cause for major concern. But at 700 m, with two laps to go, Stolz lost even more time. He was now nearly a full second behind Zhongyan. With one lap to go, Stolz bled more time: he was now 1.35 sec. off the pace. Stolz is the best finisher in his sport. But this gap was just too wide. He now was sitting fourth. Off the podium.
Which seemed impossible. Stolz put on his burners in the last lap and crossed the line with a medal: a silver, never anything to sniff at. He finished .77 sec. behind Zhongyan. As Zhongyan raised his arms and took his victory lap holding the Chinese flag, Stolz bowed his head. He was exhausted, using all his kick to salvage a medal. Zhongyan shed joyous tears.
“When Jordan was skating in the last pair, I still did not think the gold was mine,” said Zhongyan after his win. “He has been in incredible form all season. Even after he crossed the line, I was still not completely sure. It was only when the result was confirmed that it started to sink in. It is an amazing feeling.”
No doubt, Stolz’s silver stalls his storyline’s momentum. As with a Summer Olympics counterpart—says, Michael Phelps—Stolz’s quest for perfection, stretched across multiple races at the Games, was catnip for NBC, and even casual fans of a niche sport like speedskating. Will he or won’t he become just the second male speedskater in history to win four golds at an Olympics, with American Eric Heiden, who won five in 1980, being the only other? (Heiden has been on hand in Milan, cheering on his fellow Wisconsinite.)

Cheek thought that more than the 500 m, or the 1,000 m, Stolz was a safe bet in the 1,500 m. He is a two-time world champion and the reigning back-to-back World Cup champion in the distance. Going into the Games, he had won eight of nine 1,500-m World Cup races, battling that case of pneumonia in his only loss.
“I think he’s going to do it,” Cheek, an NBC speedskating commentator, told TIME a few hours before Thursday’s race. “I think it would take a meteor strike for him not to.”
That meteor, it turns out, was Zhongyan, one of China’s opening-ceremonies flag bearers at these Olympics. Zhongyan, 26, won his third medal of the Games, as he finished third in the 1000-m competition and the team pursuit. Zhongyan had also won the 2024 1000-m sprint world title, becoming the first male Chinese speedskater to ever do so. He’s not some unknown. But smashing the Olympic record, and besting Stolz, counts as a stunner.
Stolz is not done. With a win in Saturday's mass start, in which 24 athletes skate 16 laps to decide the winner, Stolz would be the first male speedskater to win three golds at a single Olympics since Johann Olav Koss of Norway did it at his home Lillehammer Olympics in 1994. Zhongyan, however, is set to join Stolz on the starting line.
Look out for the meteor.

The Cornish village where it has rained every day this year
Cardinham has experienced 50 consecutive days of rain as the deluge continues to drench Britain

- CommentsGo to comments
A village in Cornwall has experienced a 50-day spell of rain and has already received more rainfall in February than it typically would over the whole month.
Cardinham, near Bodmin, has not had a dry day since 30 December, and has endured 441.4mm of rain since the beginning of the year, according to the Met Office. However, the village is still short of its record from 2000, when it experienced 72 consecutive days of rain.
The UK has been continuously battered by unsettled weather this winter, with Storm Pedro bringing more ice and rain across the country just this week.
Met Office spokesperson Grahame Madge said the south-west region of England has had particularly high levels of rainfall due to several low-pressure systems coming towards the UK.
“There’s been a blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia for much of winter, which has meant that because that air is very cold and very dense, it’s hard to budge,” said Mr Madge. “So these low-pressure storms have been coming across the Atlantic with nowhere to go. They’ve run into this immovable block, and that means that they’ve been depositing more rainfall across areas of the UK because they can’t move any farther because of that blocking area of high pressure.”
Mr Madge said Cardinham was still forecast to have rain in the coming days, but the bad weather could soon ease as conditions begin to settle. “We’ve still got an unsettled picture,” he said. “The forecast has moderated a little bit in that we are getting periods of more settled conditions in between the pulses of rain.”
The UK’s rain deluge gave Northern Ireland its wettest January on record after it experienced 70 per cent more rainfall than the long-term average. Southwest England and the east of Scotland also had among their wettest Januaries on record.
Currently, the Environment Agency has 67 flood warnings in place for England, where flooding is expected, and 169 flood alerts, where flooding is possible. The UK Health Security Agency has issued a cold health alert for the East Midlands, eastern England, North East, North West, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the South West until Friday evening.
Met Office weather forecast for the week
Thursday
Cloud for most, with early rain or showers in the north and east. Some clear spells elsewhere before strengthening winds bring heavy rain into Northern Ireland and western Scotland later. Turning chilly where skies remain clear, but staying frost-free.
Friday
A chilly start. Outbreaks of rain moving eastwards through the morning. A brighter afternoon, with heavy and blustery showers for many. Winds freshening and turning milder from the West.
Outlook for Saturday to Monday
Much milder but often cloudy with rain or drizzle, heaviest in the west, with brighter spells at times. Sunday stays unsettled with rain. Monday briefly brighter before further rain spreads in later.

Carried an injury, but returned to Gaza: Paratrooper laid to rest after fatal friendly fire

More than 1,000 friends, relatives and acquaintances gathered Thursday at the cemetery in Moshav Hayogev in northern Israel’s Jezreel Valley to attend the funeral of Staff Sgt. Ofri Yafe, who was killed a day earlier by friendly fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
Yafe, a soldier in the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, is survived by his parents, Hadas and Yiftach, and three siblings — Noy, Tzuf and Itamar.
Lt. Col. Nevo De-Han, commander of the Paratroopers Brigade’s reconnaissance unit, eulogized Ofri and said, “I failed as a commander.”
“We were given two missions in this maneuver in Gaza,” he said. “The first was to destroy enemy infrastructure in the Khan Younis area, and in that mission we succeeded. The second mission was to bring the entire unit home safely. In that mission we failed. We failed as a unit and I failed as a commander. I am sorry we were not good enough to bring you back.”
He described his final conversations with Yafe, a soldier who had declined to attend officers’ training in order to remain at the head of his team.
“Just two weeks ago we spoke about it again,” De-Han said. “I told him that someone like him had to be a commander in the reconnaissance unit. He simply told me, ‘I am a person of giving, I have other missions.’ A few hours before he fell I told him, ‘Stay sharp.’ He replied that the team was ready at the highest level.”
Despite the circumstances of his death, Ofri’s family chose to send a message of support to the soldiers still fighting, even as he was laid to rest. De-Han said that while the unit was coping with the incident in the heart of Gaza and continuing efforts to destroy enemy infrastructure, a message arrived from his parents: “We love you and embrace you. We have no anger.”
His father, Yiftach Yafe, addressed the sniper team involved in the friendly fire incident directly in his eulogy. “We embrace the sniper and the entire team who found themselves in an illogical situation in an illogical place,” he said. “We have no anger or blame toward you. You were and remain our children.”
He reserved his criticism for Israel’s political leadership. “The anger and blame are directed solely at the country’s leadership, which sends the best of our sons on futile missions, after all our hostages have already returned home,” he said.
His mother, Hadas, added: “I still cannot comprehend it. For me, I am in a nightmare and any moment you will come and laugh at me for believing all of this.”
Yafe, a descendant of the founders of Moshav Hayogev, was a young entrepreneur who built and designed wooden furniture on the family farm. His aunt, Tzvia Gutman, spoke of dreams cut short.
“He had the mind of an entrepreneur — car restoration, pergolas, wood decks,” she said. “He planned to conquer the world after his discharge this August. Instead of revival, you found your death on the cursed soil of Gaza.”
She described him as a young man who “devoured life” and said, “You were meant to be the material that rebuilds this country.”
Roni, his partner of five and a half years, stood by the grave and spoke of plans that ended in Khan Younis. “We’ve been together since ninth grade, and we were supposed to be together forever,” she said. Just two weeks earlier they had traveled in northern Israel. “We talked all night about fulfilling our dream of living together,” she recalled, thanking him for his support. “Thank you for not leaving my side during the difficult year I went through. Thank you for teaching me what love is.”
Before Staff Sgt. Yafe was laid to rest, his father spoke to the ynet, after the parents had accused the state a day earlier of placing their sons in “unnecessary situations.”
“Ofri was a child who basically lived on the edge,” his father said. “He always loved doing extreme things. He traveled a lot. He had a Jeep and drove everywhere — the Arava desert, the Golan Heights. That was always him. Parties, lots of friends. When you live on the edge, you live on the edge — but usually he didn’t tell us anything.”
Yiftach said his son had carried an injury but continued to serve despite a recommendation that he undergo surgery. “During paratroopers training he landed badly on a rock and injured his knee,” he said. “He carried the pain for a long time but completed the course and excelled in basic training. A week and a half ago he had an orthopedic exam and they recommended surgery, but he wanted to stay with his team so he chose to return to Gaza. He also told Hadas he had bad feelings. He was a child who was never afraid of anything. That may have been one of his problems — he was not afraid of anything.”
He said that despite the parents’ criticism of government policy, their views did not influence their son’s decisions. “Ofri believed deeply in his team, in his friends. They were the closest thing to him,” he said. “If his team went in, then he went in with them. There was no other option.”
He added that their public statement reflected only his and his wife’s views. “What we said was our opinion alone,” he said. “We did not ask Ofri and we did not ask our other children. We believe the government’s current policy in Gaza is not the right policy.”
The father emphasized that the family had no accusations against the military. “We have no pointing finger toward the army, any of its commanders, the Paratroopers Brigade or the reconnaissance unit,” he said. “They are the best of our sons. They are our children, and we embrace them — including the sniper who was tragically involved in an incident that should not have happened. Our only criticism is why the best of our sons are inside the Gaza Strip when there are no hostages left and nothing more to achieve there.”
He continued, criticizing the government: “When there is no leadership and no strategy, this is the result. When you do not look at things holistically and correctly but in a populist way. Unfortunately this time it is us. We all hope Ofri will be the last casualty of this very unnecessary campaign.”
Asked what Ofri would want to say to the nation at this difficult time, his father replied: “Very simply. He would say, ‘Be good to one another and love life.’”

Turkish president remains committed to Gaza's security stabilization, recovery, says top diplomat
Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan says humanitarian situation in Gaza ‘remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur’
ISTANBUL
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan remains committed to security stabilization and recovery in the Gaza Strip, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday.
Fidan made the remarks at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which convened in Washington under the chairmanship of US President Donald Trump.
He said that “after two years of human suffering, (a) ceasefire in Gaza has been achieved, thanks to President Trump's personal engagement and our collective efforts.”
“Yet the humanitarian situation remains fragile, and ceasefire violations continue to occur. A prompt, coordinated and effective response is therefore essential,” said Fidan.
“President Erdogan remains fully committed to Gaza's security stabilization and recovery. Türkiye has already been providing (an) immense amount of humanitarian assistance to Gaza,” he said. “We can also contribute meaningfully to the rehabilitation of health and education sectors, as well as the training of the police force. In addition, we are prepared to provide troops to the International Stabilization Force.”
“Türkiye will continue to support your (Trump’s) efforts towards a just and lasting peace. We remain convinced that the foundation of such peace is a two-state solution. Let us work towards that objective for the benefit of all peoples of the region,” he added.

Five countries have committed troops to the newly formed Gaza International Stabilization Force (ISF), with Indonesia pledging up to 8,000 soldiers to anchor the mission aimed at securing the enclave and laying the groundwork for lasting peace.
Major General Jasper Jeffers, commander of the ISF, announced at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington on Thursday that Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania have formally pledged troops to the nascent security body. Egypt and Jordan will instead focus on training Palestinian police forces.
Jeffers also confirmed that Indonesia has accepted the position of deputy commander of the force.
"With these first steps, we will help bring the security that Gaza needs for our future prosperity and enduring peace," he said.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto underscored Jakarta's commitment, pledging 8,000 "or more" troops to the stabilisation mission.
"We reaffirm our commitment to contribute a significant number of troops, up to 8,000 or more, if necessary," Prabowo said. Despite expected challenges, he voiced optimism that "with the leadership of President Donald Trump, this vision of real peace will be achieved".
The troop commitments come as Gaza's local administrative leadership outlined its own roadmap for rebuilding the enclave.
Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), set out four priorities: restoring security through a unified civilian police force; reviving economic activity and jobs, particularly for youth; ensuring sustainable emergency relief; and rebuilding essential services such as electricity, water, health and education while improving freedom of movement.
"Our mandate is simple," Shaath said. "Step by step, to build the foundation for lasting peace, dignity and prosperity for the people of Gaza."

The quiet conquest of the West Bank and the death of the Oslo Accords

The quiet conquest of the West Bank and the death of the Oslo Accords
Through a new land registration drive, Israel is trying to secure through paperwork what warfare alone has failed to deliver.
Israel always had a plan to annex more land in the occupied West Bank, and its actions prove it.
This week, the Israeli cabinet approved a plan to claim Palestinian lands in the West Bank as “state land”. The proposal, pushed by far-right Israeli leaders, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz, emphasises Israeli supremacy over Palestinians.
The Israeli government has created 35 new positions and allocated 244.1 million shekels (nearly $79m) for the land registration project from 2026 to 2030.
The process outlined in the proposal is not new in itself. It is a process that has been frozen since 1967, and the most recent resumption is a continuation of Israel’s longstanding plan to take over Palestinian lands. While Israel suspended the land registration process in 1967, it did not suspend its practices of ethnic cleansing, colonial violence and de facto land annexation.
For Palestinians, this decision does not mark a new escalation but a solidification of the Israeli presence in the West Bank. While it may seem like mere paperwork, it is actually a milestone in Israel’s gradual takeover of the West Bank, the last remaining territorial obstacle to the completion of Israel’s colonial project in Palestine.
Bureaucracy as annexation
This shift cannot be understood without revisiting the Oslo Accords. Under the 1993 and 1995 agreements, the West Bank was carved into Areas A, B and C as an “interim” arrangement that was never meant to become permanent. Area C, the largest area containing the most land and resources, remained under full Israeli control while Areas A and B were left as fragmented Palestinian islands with limited Palestinian authority.
That made Area C the real battlefield.
As part of the new policy, land registration in Area C, which constitutes more than 62 percent of the West Bank, is to take place through the Land Title Settlement Administration, part of Israel’s Ministry of Justice. What this in effect does is shift Area C from military administration into direct Israeli civilian governance.
These measures should not be taken lightly. They are telling of Israel’s latest annexation strategy: governance.
On February 8, a week before the Israeli cabinet’s approval to register West Bank lands as state land, Israeli authorities adopted new measures that open land purchase mechanisms for settlers while reducing oversight. That same day, Israeli authorities also moved to further erode Palestinian Authority powers in Areas A and B, which under international agreements signed by Israel should be under full administrative Palestinian control.
Taken together, these measures mark a new phase of Zionist territorial conquest in the 21st century – one that relies less on overt warfare and more on administrative consolidation.
In 1948, Zionist militias pursued territorial conquest through large-scale warfare, mass displacement and the redrawing of borders. Today, conquest increasingly operates through clerical mechanisms.
It is not accidental that a minister as vocally racist as Smotrich explained the plan as an attempt to end “current chaos that is bad for everyone – Jews and Arabs alike”. While Israel’s goal of taking over Palestinian lands has remained unchanged, the post-Oslo era and the reputational damage Israel has sustained during its genocidal war on Gaza mean that visible and large-scale violence is not sustainable for long-term achievements in the West Bank.
So rather than tanks, bombs and dramatic declarations of territorial conquest, Israel is lowering both regional and international alarm by consolidating land through perceived bureaucracy.
From paperwork to dispossession
Israel is pushing its West Bank policies as neutral cadastral clean-up when in reality they are large-scale land grabs carried out through administrative means. It is an act of state building that allows Zionist Israelis to determine whose claims over Palestinian lands are legal and whose vanish.
This is precisely why land registration matters: Once land is entered into the Israeli registry as “state land”, it becomes a legal reality far more difficult to reverse than a temporary military seizure.
For Palestinians, this policy signals serious danger because we have seen it before. After the large-scale dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their lands in 1948, about 150,000 Palestinians remained in what became Israel.
These Palestinians were put under military rule until the 1960s despite holding Israeli citizenship. This was not done for security; it was done to ensure territorial restructuring. Lands that did not have Palestinians physically present on them were absorbed through the Absentees Property Law.
A similar dynamic is unfolding today in the West Bank, where physical displacement and restricted access are again being converted into legal dispossession. In the West Bank, the last two years have seen alarming rates of settler violence that have pushed thousands of Palestinians off their lands while other areas have been taken and declared closed military zones. This denied Palestinians access to their homes, farmlands and properties. Under Israeli law, these can all be considered absentee lands, even if their rightful owners are just a few metres away and unable to reach their lands due to Israeli hostilities.
Through this, Israel is creating a system in which the default legal outcome produces territorial absorption. The bureaucratic aspect of this means that annexation becomes irreversible. It is no longer a temporary military seizure operation; it is transforming territory into property operating within a state system, in this case the Israeli legal system.
More dangerously, historical evidence shows that Israel has not only absorbed Palestinian lands through bureaucracy but also coerced Palestinians to engage with Israeli legal structures as a final avenue.
Still today, Palestinians with Israeli citizenship in areas such as Ein Hod are in legal battles over land. Not only were they displaced from their village, which now serves as a Jewish artist colony, but Palestinians are also just a few kilometres away, holding Israeli citizenship. Decades later, they remain in legal battles to secure building permits to live on the nearby lands they were forced to move to.
Why the world enables administrative conquest
It is important to realise that all of this was made possible by the international community’s refusal to address the criminality of the Israeli regime as a whole.
Condemnations of individual Israeli settler attacks in the last two years and refusal to disarm Israel despite having committed genocide are precisely what is allowing Israel to persist in its colonial expansion. For years Palestinians, as well as international human rights organisations, have warned not only of rising Israeli settler violence but also of a clear synchronisation of efforts by the army and armed Israeli militias in the West Bank.
Palestinians shared reports, tried to tell the stories of trees uprooted by the thousands, of water pipelines being destroyed by Israelis, of large-scale arson attacks and pogroms across different cities and towns, of settlers being armed with military-grade weapons and trained by the army in illegal settlements.
However, the world defined violence only when it came in the shape of bullets and bombs, which is what allowed Israel to shift strategies in the West Bank. While Palestinians are disarmed in the West Bank, all that was left were outcries and calls for media coverage. Violence enacted against Palestinians was reduced to random and exceptional acts of hostility.
Yet in the West Bank, Israel did not choose dramatic war; it chose subtlety. In the last two years, the battlefield in the West Bank has diffused into everyday life and relocated into the nervous system. Violence no longer depends on constant lethal force but on permanent anticipation of a settler attack, a military raid or a court demolition order. Constant surveillance, drones overhead, incessant home invasions, arrests and checkpoints every few metres hold the body captive.
All of these practices paved the way for the ongoing displacement and dispossession of Palestinians from their lands. More importantly, they are precisely why Israel is able to push renewed policies to register lands as state lands and to allow Israelis to buy lands with little oversight.
What this must teach us is that sometimes war exists in the subtleties, and the absence of relentless bombing does not mean the absence of war.

Costa meets with wounded Ukrainian soldier at hospital in Oslo
He stated this on X, Ukrinform reports.
"To date, more than 2,750 patients have been evacuated with Norway's support to hospitals across Europe under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism — a vital contribution to our collective support for Ukraine," he stressed.
He expressed gratitude to the "dedicated doctors and nurses" of Oslo University Hospital, who have been providing medical assistance to many evacuated Ukrainian patients since the start of the full-scale invasion.
He also shared his impressions of meeting a Ukrainian serviceman, Ihor, who continues to recover from injuries sustained on the Zaporizhzhia front last autumn.
"I wish him a full and speedy recovery," Costa wrote, adding that he was "deeply moved" by the meeting.
As Ukrinform previously reported, President of the European Council Antonio Costa arrived in Oslo today for high-level meetings to mark the strong momentum in EU–Norway bilateral relations.
According to the visit program, he had an audience with the Crown Prince Regent and then met with Prime Minister of Norway Jonas Gahr Store.
He also visited Oslo University Hospital, which plays a key role in Norway's support for Ukraine by treating hundreds of patients evacuated due to the war. As a major trauma center, it provides specialized care for war-related injuries.
Costa is also set to visit the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) in Kjeller, near Oslo. FFI has been a key player in supporting and strengthening Norway's defense capabilities through advanced research and innovation. It has participated in joint defense research and development under the European Defence Fund (EDF), receiving financial support from the EU.

Two suspects charged over killing of French far-right activist Quentin Deranque
A French court on Thursday brought homicide charges against two suspects in the fatal beating of far-right activist Quentin Deranque, 23, after violent clashes in the French city of Lyon. Most of those detained are from far-left movements.

A French court brought homicide charges Thursday against two suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger in France and beyond.
In the latest fallout from the killing, President Emmanuel Macron told Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs after she expressed concern about a perceived ideological motive for the violence.
Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on February 12. Most of the 11 suspects who had been detained are from far-left movements.
Prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested "intentional homicide" charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any "disturbance to public order".
He later told AFP that two of the men had been charged with homicide.
A third suspected was charged with complicity in the killing – identified as Jacques-Elie Favrot, a parliamentary assistant to lawmaker Raphael Arnault of the hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI) – the suspect's lawyer Bertrand Sayn told reporters.
Favrot was remanded in custody, his lawyer said.
A judge was scheduled to rule later on whether four others would face charges.
The killing has fuelled political tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and France's 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.
On Wednesday, Italy's far-right leader Meloni said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe".

Macron said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence" and called on all political parties to "clean up" their act.
"Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic."
Macron also suggested that everyone must "stay in their own lane", after Meloni lamented "a climate of ideological hatred".
"I'm always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don't want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what's happening elsewhere," Macron said, while on a visit to New Delhi.
'Terrible past'
Italy's foreign minister hit back saying the killing of the French activist "is a serious matter that concerns us all".
Antonio Tajani said on X there had been similar incidents in Italy's history, and that condemning such violence aims "to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past".
He said "there have been many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the Republic".
Macron is "closely monitoring" events, a member of his team said Thursday. "We must avoid any spiral of violence."
Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing.
Lyon prosecutor Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two have refused to speak while in custody.
Others have acknowledged being at the scene and "some admit to having struck blows", but he added, they all dispute having had any homicidal intent.
Four suspects have been released, but more are being sought, Dran said.
Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphael Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.

A lawyer for Deranque's parents said they called "for calm and restraint".
"The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence," Fabien Rajon told broadcaster RTL.
In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard-left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far-right from power.
But following Deranque's killing some high-profile politicians sought to distance themselves from the hard-left, ruling out any possible futue alliance.
Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin called on Arnault to "draw the consequences" if the judiciary "finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired".
LFI party coordinator Manuel Bompard said that Arnault would "certainly not" be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the National Assembly lower house.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

Freelance journalist detained in Cameroon while reporting for AP on US deportees

YAOUNDE, Feb 19 - A freelance journalist on assignment for the Associated Press was slapped by police and briefly detained alongside three other reporters and a lawyer in Yaounde while attempting to interview Africans recently deported from the United States, two sources told Reuters.
The journalists had their equipment confiscated, which has yet to be returned, and were taken to the judicial police by plainclothes officers on Tuesday after attempting to film the facility hosting the deportees, sources said.
"It was an extremely stressful experience," said freelance journalist Randy Joe Sa'ah, who was briefly detained.
"I was surprised by how quickly the situation escalated. It felt as though our only 'offence' was simply being present at the facility where people were being held," he said.
AP declined to comment.
Cameroon's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and police did not respond to requests for comment.
The first group of deportees arrived in Cameroon in January, including two individuals from Ghana, two from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), two from Morocco, two from Angola, and one from Zimbabwe. The Moroccans have since returned home but the remaining seven migrants remain in Cameroon.
A second group arrived early on Monday and included three Ethiopians, one Senegalese, one Kenyan, one Sierra Leonean, and two from the DRC.
The Trump administration has approached a number of African governments about accepting deportees as part of its campaign to deter immigration through high-profile deportations to so-called "third countries." In some cases migrants have voiced concerns for their safety. Cameroon has not disclosed whether it participated in the U.S. administration's program. The State Department could not be immediately reached for comment.
The recent flights brought the total number of deportees in Cameroon to 17, according to four deportees and two lawyers.
All the deportees had been granted withholding of removal status in the U.S., which protects individuals from deportation to countries where they fear persecution or harm. REUTERS

Trump's 'Board of Peace' members pledge $7 billion for Gaza
February 19, 2026US President Donald Trump launched the inaugural meeting of his "Board of Peace" on Thursday, with representatives from over 40 countries and observers from a dozen others present.
Trump said that $7 billion (just under €6 billion) had been pledged by nine members of the organization for a Gaza relief package. That amounts to just 10% of the $70 billion needed to rebuild after the devastation of two years of war.
The US president also pledged $10 billion, but without saying where that money would go.
Who has pledged money to the Board of Peace?
Trump said Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait were the countries offering to fund the Board of Peace relief package for Gaza.
"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability and the hope of new and harmonious [region]," the US president said.
"The Board of Peace is showing how a better future can be built, starting right here in this room," he added.
Trump also used his platform to attack domestic opponents and praise his own endorsements of foreign leaders in elections.
Beyond pledges for financing, the following countries also said they would send troops to Gaza to be part of a stabilization force: Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania.
What is Trump's 'Board of Peace'?
The so-called "Board of Peace" came out of a ceasefire deal negotiated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza to end two years of war. However, that deal has not brought an end to the deadly violence, with more than 600 Palestinians killed since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
Though the Board originated as a Gaza-specific reconstruction body, its charter evolved into a broader and more ambiguous mandate. The founding charter, signed in Davos on January 22, 2026, does not explicitly mention Gaza. Trump's opaque comments have led to criticisms that he is trying to overshadow the UN, from which he has also withdrawn much US funding.
However, the organization functions very differently from the UN. Members are obliged to pay $1 billion to extend their membership beyond the first two years and Trump has appointed himself chair, meaning he will remain in control even after leaving office.
Besides obvious Trump allies such as leaders from Israel, Hungary and Argentina, there are also countries such as Pakistan seeking favor with the White House who have signed up to the board.
Germany, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and several others sent observers rather than representatives. Meanwhile, France has rejected any participation and criticized the EU for sending officials.

Archaeologists confirm 2,000-year-old discovery at Scottish beach
- Two dog walkers discovered 2,000-year-old human and animal footprints on a Scottish beach at Lunan Bay, Angus, after recent storms revealed a fresh layer of clay.
- Archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen confirmed the prints date back to the height of the Roman Empire, noting it is a unique and rare discovery for Scotland, with no previous record of such a site.
- The archaeological team faced a race against time and extreme weather, working in windspeeds over 55mph to record the site before it was reclaimed by the sea within 48 hours.
- Despite the rapid destruction, the team successfully recorded and mapped the site, capturing 3D models and physical casts of the prints for further analysis.
- Ongoing analysis has identified footprints from humans, roe deer, red deer, and other animals, providing insights into the ancient environment and its inhabitants during the late Iron Age.

Spending even more on defence won’t buy us peace | Letters

We are told to spend even more, and more quickly, on the armed forces, whose current budget for this year is expected to amount to more than £60bn (‘Britain ‘needs to go faster’ on defence spending, Starmer says, 16 February). The Ministry of Defence must surely first show it can put its house in order.
The government is considering whether to scrap Ajax, the army’s planned new armoured vehicle, even though more than £6bn of taxpayers’ money has already been spent on the project. Ajax is eight years late, its defects so serious that vibration and noise have made soldiers training on it sick, with some suffering hearing loss.
It is the latest and most egregious example of the huge waste caused by the MoD’s incompetence and profligacy over recent years. It has spent many billions on items, including aircraft carriers, that would be extremely vulnerable in modern conflicts, something that has been evident for a long time.
The chairs of the Commons defence and public accounts committees told the MoD last month that its failure to publish its equipment plan in 2023, and again in 2024, has resulted in an unacceptable gap in parliament and the public’s ability to scrutinise defence spending. Repeated delays in publishing the MoD’s current plan risk sending damaging signals to adversaries, they added. The delays also signal that the MoD culture is unfit for purpose and its leadership cannot be trusted with so much of the British public’s money.
Richard Norton-Taylor

Desire for greater security comes from people and countries feeling unsafe and fearful (British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmament, 15 February). But experience has shown that the apparent security that comes from rearmament is temporary at best and can provoke the conflict it tries to prevent.
The British and German defence chiefs may argue that “strength deters aggression”, but this conceals the reality that Britain already has the world’s sixth-largest military budget, and that Nato’s military spending already dwarfs Russia’s. Their argument could easily come from defence chiefs in Russia or any other hostile state. As we are seeing with the US as well as Russia, strength also begets aggression.
Countries aren’t static in responding to each other, and there’s a high likelihood that military buildup in Europe will spur further militarisation elsewhere. Long-term peace comes from building trust, friendship and mutual dependence between nations, not the constant threat of military retaliation.
Oliver Robertson
Head of witness and worship, Quakers in Britain
So the British and German military chiefs are making the moral case for rearmament in order to “preserve peace”. Doing so, they say, is not warmongering. However, when doing so has led to a 45% cut in the government’s funding through the Integrated Security Fund dedicated to building peace and preventing conflict and when the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is being “restructured” with the loss of considerable conflict expertise, it does rather look like warmongering.
If we are serious about preserving peace, we need to be investing in those diplomats and peacebuilders who are able to de-escalate and reduce tensions. Rearming without investing in these skill sets will simply increase tensions still further. It is the opposite of preserving peace.
Lt Col David Couzens (retired)
Faringdon, Oxfordshire
The defence chiefs of the UK and Germany quite rightly warn us of the increasing threat from a rapidly rearming Russia, and call for “an honest conversation” with citizens about defence being the responsibility of each and every one of us.
Any meaningful conversation must be preceded by a crash course in recent events and an outline of the specific threats. Few people in the UK nowadays have any reason to be concerned about defence, and successive governments have been much too timid to talk openly about the threat of war for fear of spooking the population.
There is one significant omission from the proposed conversation. If the government wants citizens to engage in building a whole-of-society defence, it must spell out in detail how it will protect us should open conflict break out. Civil defence organisations disappeared along with the cold war, and the (very few) nuclear shelters allocated to civilians have fallen into complete disrepair.
Hannah Walker
Wymondham, Norfolk
The British and German defence chiefs write of the “moral dimension” of rearmament and say that weakness invites aggression. I would suggest that the people of Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine have offered no such invitation to their bear-like neighbour. Nor, indeed, the people of Iraq to this country’s catastrophic aggression in 2003. Greenlanders will likewise be anxiously checking their own invitation list.
The top brass are nonetheless right that a whole-of-society approach is required to meet the complexity of threats to the UK and Europe – not just those emanating from Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and their ilk, but also climate breakdown, grotesque inequality, and deadly new technologies. But that approach cannot be reduced to a lecture on how military industries must prevail at the expense of our health and welfare.
Eight months since the last defence and security reviews, we are still nowhere near the “continent-wide conversation with the public” that the prime minister and security elites glibly prescribe. The public remains wholly outside the conversation on its own security, excluded from even tokenistic input to the last national security strategy.
We ignore at our peril how the “peace dividend” investment of the post-cold-war era strengthened our society, as well as how that trust, unity and resilience has been steadily undermined by austerity, corruption, misinvestment in wars of choice, and the politics of polarisation. If morally conscious leaders genuinely want to protect their people, they would do well to listen and look at home too. The UK’s weakened society invites not deflection and aggression, but recognition and action.

Denmark says unclear why it was not invited to Trump's Board of Peace meeting
Foreign minister says: 'We want lasting peace in Gaza, and we want it to happen in a way that includes the Palestinian Authority'
BRUSSELS
US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in the Gaza Strip at the inaugural meeting Thursday of the Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump said the US is contributing $10 billion to the new body.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.
The US president noted Japan is committed to host a fundraiser, "which will be a very big one."
US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said humanitarian flows into Gaza have improved significantly, with 4,200 aid trucks entering the territory each week for 13 consecutive weeks, “the longest stretch of high-volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
"Aid is up," he said, adding that it was now reaching the full 2.1 million Gazans, up as much as five times from previous delivery levels.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.
Despite a ceasefire, the Israeli army continued its attacks, killing at least 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Romania, Hungary back Trump peace initiative for Gaza at first Board of Peace meeting
Leaders outline humanitarian aid, reconstruction plans for Gaza while praising US president’s role in global peace diplomacy
ISTANBUL
Romania’s President Nicusor Dan and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed support Thursday for US President Donald Trump’s peace initiative in remarks at the first meeting of the Board of Peace.
Dan thanked Trump for his “involvement and leadership” and described the proposed Gaza Strip peace plan as “comprehensive and stable,” while outlining steps Romania could take, particularly in humanitarian and institutional support.
“I think everyone desire peace, stability, prosperity in Gaza, but the question is how to act for and that's why this meeting is and this format, it's important what Romanian can do first on the humanitarian situation, we can increase the number of flights in order to extract children with disease and to treat in the Romanian hospitals we've done already, and we can do 4,000 children and 4,000 family members,” he said.
He added that Romania could help rebuild emergency response systems and public institutions in Gaza, citing prior international experience.
“Secondly, we had a good expertise in emergency report systems, like ambulance fire systems, and we can help in order to rebuild that system, and we can donate some infrastructure, some equipment. Third, we (are) already offering some scholarships for Palestinian students, and we can extend the program. And we can also help to rebuild, refurbish the schools in Gaza and force," he added.
Orban praised Trump’s global diplomatic efforts and framed Hungary’s participation as principled and strategic.
“First of all, let me express the appreciation of the Hungarian people to President Trump for his tireless peace efforts all around the world,” he said.
He emphasized Hungary’s status within the EU representation at the meeting. “Hungary is the only country to be represented here on the highest level among the founding members from the European Union.”
Linking Middle East stability to Europe’s security, Orban said, “We in Europe understand clearly that the security situation in (the) Middle East, and especially in Gaza, has a significant impact on the security of Europe.”
He argued that new mechanisms were needed to address global conflicts, criticizing existing institutions.
“We understand that during the recent decades, international organizations have failed to fulfill their role to preserve peace and stability worldwide. Therefore, new initiatives are needed to bring forward the issue of peace globally,” he said.
Israel began its war in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90% of civilian infrastructure.

Etsy stock pops on Depop deal despite disappointing revenue, merchandise sales

Etsy shares popped 9% on Thursday after the company said it plans to offload its fashion resale app Depop to eBay for about $1.2 billion in cash.
The online marketplace also reported mixed earnings results for the fourth quarter.
Here's how Etsy did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 92 cents vs. 84 cents estimated
- Revenue: $882 million vs. $885 million estimated
Gross merchandise sales, or the dollar value of items sold, slid 3.8% year over year to $3.59 billion and missed analyst estimates of $3.6 billion, according to FactSet. The company attributed the annual decline to its sale of musical instrument marketplace Reverb, which was completed last June.
The downbeat results were overshadowed by the Depop deal announced on Wednesday. Etsy CEO Kruti Patel Goyal said in a statement that the sale would allow the company to "focus exclusively" on its core marketplace.
EBay said Depop, a resale app popular among younger consumers, complements its business and would strengthen its presence in fashion, which has become one of its fastest-growing categories.
Shares of eBay also climbed 3% on Thursday.
In the fourth quarter, Etsy's net income dropped 14.8% year over year to $110.7 million, or 92 cents per share, compared with $129.9 million, or $1.03 per share, one year ago.
The company, known for its marketplace of handcrafted and artisan wares, has recently stepped up its marketing investments as it looks to reach more U.S. consumers.
Etsy has been contending with stiffer competition in online retail, along with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. The company said in its annual filing released Thursday that it's been pressured by an ongoing pullback in consumer discretionary spending and "evolving buyer behavior."
Active sellers grew 7.7% year over year to 8.76 million, surpassing analysts estimated 8.5 million. Active buyers declined 2% year over year to 93.54 million, compared with Wall Street's estimated 93.1 million.
For the first quarter, Etsy guided for gross merchandise sales to come in between $2.38 billion and $2.43 billion, compared with GMS of $2.8 billion one year earlier. Analysts anticipated $2.68 billion in GMS.

SANTIAGO, Feb 19 - Chilean authorities on Thursday raided the homes of two recently dismissed executives of state copper miner Codelco as they continue their investigation into a deadly collapse at the El Teniente mine last year.
Officials during the searches seized digital equipment from ex-Chief Operations Officer Mauricio Barraza and former mine manager Claudio Sougarret, Chile's prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Codelco facilities were also searched, with some equipment voluntarily handed over by the company. Codelco declined to comment.
Authorities added that items belonging to Rodrigo Andrades, former El Teniente projects manager, had been seized in October.
The three executives were removed from their jobs last week after an internal audit found inconsistencies tied to a 2023 rock explosion at El Teniente, including in Codelco's following reports to mining regulator Sernageomin.
Sernageomin said earlier this week it would file formal complaints to authorities.
Last year, the same mine was the site of a collapse that killed six people. REUTERS

Details: The so-called Special Assistance Act for Ukrainians, in place since 2022, has established a separate legal framework that simplifies rules for residence, work, access to benefits and education for refugees from Ukraine.
The new law gradually abolishes this system and key support instruments will be included in the general provisions on the protection of foreigners.
Additionally, the signed document also extends the legitimacy of staying in Poland for Ukrainian citizens who fled the war until 4 March 2027.
One of the significant changes in the law is the introduction of the requirement to apply for a PESEL number, a personal identification number that provides access to various services and simplifies bureaucratic procedures, within 30 days of entering Poland.
Failure to submit an application within this period will result in the expiry of the temporary protection and will be regarded as a refusal to receive this form of support.
Background:
- In November 2025, President of Poland Karol Nawrocki announced that he had signed the law on assistance to citizens of Ukraine for the last time, and in the future, they will be treated like other national minorities.
- The previous law on aid for Ukrainians was vetoed by the Polish president, citing what he called an allegedly excessive amount of social assistance provided to Ukrainian refugees.
- The new law, rapidly prepared by the Polish government, was finally approved by the parliament on 17 September.

Ukrainian model allegedly recruited girls for Epstein
A Ukrainian model who met Jeffrey Epstein in person and likely received expensive gifts and money from him may have recruited girls for the American sex offender.
Source: an investigation by Slidstvo.Info, an independent team of investigative journalists
Details: Correspondence between the financier and a Ukrainian woman known as Nastia N. has been found in the Epstein files – the latest documents and photographs which the US Department of Justice released at the beginning of 2026.
During 2015-2019, Nastia N. corresponded with Epstein's assistant, Lesley Groff, and the financier himself, who built a network of sexual exploitation and human trafficking, including children.
The messages indicate that Groff scheduled meetings between Nastia and Epstein and also arranged payment for her education, visits to beauty salons, tickets from Kyiv to New York, and gifts including a new laptop worth US$3,500.
The files include messages in which the financier asks the model to find him an "assistant" aged 22 to 25, who had to be "smart and willing to travel".
"Of course I will find you girls," Nastia replied.
The model offered Epstein several candidates, including 25-year-old Elena from Russia. It was later arranged for the woman to go on a multi-day trip to one of the financier's islands, where many women have testified that they were raped.
Later, Nastia wrote to the sex offender again to suggest that he consider another candidate for "Jeffrey-land" – likely Epstein's island. Epstein turned this one down, and the model sent him further suggestions.
In 2019, Epstein wrote to his assistant to remind her about "10k for Nastia N". It is not known what this money was for or whether the Ukrainian model received it.
When the Slidstvo.Info journalists attempted to contact Nastia, she read their messages but did not reply to them, and then made her Instagram page private.
They did manage to speak to Nastia's mother, who lives in Ukraine.
She replied: "I asked her [about the Epstein files – ed.]. She said she's very glad that she is on the sidelines of these events. I don't know how she can appear there." She promised to let her daughter know that the journalists had approached her for comment.

Ex-South Korean President Yoon gets life sentence for insurrection

Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was convicted on Thursday of orchestrating an insurrection and received a life sentence for his short-lived declaration of martial law in 2024, in a verdict that brings a dramatic close to what has been the nation's most severe political turmoil in decades.
The conservative leader was ousted from office after he declared martial law and sent troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, 2024, in a baffling attempt to overcome a legislature controlled by his liberal opponents.
Judge Jee Kui-youn of the Seoul Central District Court said he found Yoon, 65, guilty of rebellion for mobilizing military and police forces in an illegal attempt to seize the Assembly, arrest political opponents and establish unchecked power for an indefinite period.
Yoon's martial law imposition, the first of its kind in more than four decades, recalled South Korea's past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed emergency decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations.
As lawmakers rushed to the National Assembly, Yoon's martial law command issued a proclamation declaring sweeping powers, including suspending political activities, controlling the media and publications, and allowing arrests without warrants.
The decree lasted about six hours before being lifted after a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through a military blockade and unanimously voted to lift the measure.
Yoon was suspended from office on Dec. 14, 2024, after being impeached by lawmakers and was formally removed by the Constitutional Court in April 2025. He has been under arrest since last July while facing multiple criminal trials, with the rebellion charge carrying the most severe punishment.
An expressionless Yoon gazed straight ahead as the judge delivered the sentence in the same courtroom where former military rulers and presidents have been convicted of treason, corruption and other crimes over the decades.
Yoon Kap-keun, one of the former president's lawyers, accused the judge of issuing a "predetermined verdict" based solely on prosecutors' arguments and said the "rule of law" had collapsed. He said he would discuss whether to appeal with his client and the rest of the legal team.
Former President Yoon claimed in court that the martial law decree was only meant to raise public awareness of how the liberals were paralyzing state affairs, and that he was prepared to respect lawmakers if they voted against the measure.
Prosecutors said it was clear Yoon was attempting to disable the legislature and prevent lawmakers from lifting the measure through voting, actions that exceeded his constitutional authority even under martial law.
The court also convicted and sentenced five former military and police officials involved in enforcing Yoon's martial law decree.
They included ex-Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who received a 30-year jail term for his central role in planning the measure, mobilizing the military and instructing military counterintelligence officials to arrest 14 key politicians, including National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik and current liberal President Lee Jae Myung.
In announcing Yoon and Kim's verdicts, Jee said the decision to send troops to the National Assembly was key to his determination that the imposition of martial law amounted to rebellion.
"This court finds that the purpose of (Yoon's) actions was to send troops to the National Assembly, block the Assembly building and arrest key figures, including the National Assembly speaker and the leaders of both the ruling and opposition parties, in order to prevent lawmakers from gathering to deliberate or vote," Jee said.
"It's sufficiently established that he intended to obstruct or paralyze the Assembly's activities so that it would be unable to properly perform its functions for a considerable period of time."
As Yoon arrived in court, hundreds of police officers watched closely as Yoon supporters rallied outside a judicial complex, their cries rising as the prison bus transporting him drove past. Yoon's critics gathered nearby, demanding the death penalty.
There were no immediate reports of major clashes following the verdict.
A special prosecutor had demanded the death penalty for Yoon Suk Yeol, saying his actions posed a threat to the country's democracy and deserved the most serious punishment available, but most analysts had expected a life sentence since the poorly-planned power grab did not result in casualties.
South Korea has not executed a death row inmate since 1997, in what is widely seen as a de facto moratorium on capital punishment amid calls for its abolition.
Jung Chung-rae, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which led the push to impeach and remove Yoon, expressed regret that the court stopped short of the death penalty, saying the ruling reflected a "lack of a sense of justice."
Song Eon-seok, floor leader of the conservative People Power Party, to which Yoon once belonged, issued a public apology, saying the party feels a "deep sense of responsibility" for the disruption to the nation.
The office of current President Lee Jae Myung did not immediately comment on the ruling.
Last month, Yoon was sentenced to five years in prison for resisting arrest, fabricating the martial law proclamation and sidestepping a legally mandated full Cabinet meeting before declaring the measure.
The Seoul Central Court had previously convicted two other members of Yoon's Cabinet in connection with the martial law debacle. That includes Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who received a 23-year prison sentence for attempting to legitimize the decree by forcing it through a Cabinet Council meeting, falsifying records and lying under oath. Han has appealed the verdict.
Yoon is the first former South Korean president to receive a life sentence since former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan, who was sentenced to death in 1996 for his 1979 coup, a bloody 1980 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Gwangju that left more than 200 people dead or missing, and corruption.
The Supreme Court later reduced his sentence to life imprisonment, and he was released in late 1997 under a special presidential pardon. He died in 2021.

Türkiye takes all necessary steps beyond its borders for its security, neutralizing threats at their source without seeking permission from anyone, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Thursday.
Speaking at an iftar program with families of martyrs at Çankaya Mansion in the capital Ankara, Erdoğan said that significant progress has been made in efforts toward a “terror-free Türkiye.”
“There has been a serious decrease in security risks directed at our country, both within and beyond our borders,” he said.
Referring to terrorism, Erdoğan said: “We are determined to rid Türkiye forever of this scourge that has burned the hearts of our nation for nearly half a century.”
He noted that thanks to operations by the armed forces and other security units, “we have significantly restricted the mobility of terrorist organizations.”
“Today, we can meet almost all our needs ourselves in nearly every field, including UAVs, armed UAVs, missiles, rockets, ships, helicopters and tanks,” he said.
He further added that an agreement was reached last month to resolve the issue in northern Syria without bloodshed, adding that “the process leading to full integration has begun.”

Drinks, darts, DJs and drag queens: the artwork that’s a fully-functioning pub – with the artist pulling pints

‘The art world has a real issue with making things overly conceptual, too complicated and using wanky jargon,” says Trackie McLeod. “It alienates people.” So, for his latest show, Utopia, the 32-year-old Glaswegian has decided to create something more welcoming and familiar: a pub.
Custom-built from scratch, the exhibition is a fully functioning boozer. McLeod will pull pints for punters, there’s a dartboard where you can take aim at images of Thatcher or Trump, and visitors can explore his mixed-media artworks, spanning print, sculpture and sound, and swing by to catch drag acts, DJs and panel discussions.
“I’ve even got a fruit machine that spits out chocolate coins,” he says. “Which is a comment on how these machines rinse working-class pockets for their own gain. Whereas with this work, everyone’s a winner.”
Utopia takes place at Factory International’s Aviva Studios in Manchester, and was commissioned by its Young Curators team. Touching on themes of nostalgia, class, identity and gentrification, it is also an ode to pubs and working men’s clubs as vital community hubs.
“I grew up in places like this,” McLeod says. “All our family occasions were there – weddings, birthdays, funerals. It’s where all the disputes happened. Spaces that were cheap and cheerful but championed character and comfort. I’m trying to bring back a sense of togetherness that we’re lacking at the moment.”
McLeod – whose nickname, Trackie, is based on his propensity, when younger, for bringing out a fresh tracksuit to put on when a party ran into day two – is having a very busy run. After two successful exhibitions, Fruit (2024) and Fruit II (2025), he now also has Soft Play running at the Charleston in Lewes until mid-April, where he has recreated an outdoor play park in the exhibition space. It explores “the awkward transition from childhood into teenager”, he says. “When you’re playing as an adult in these spaces – like drinking and vandalising – but are still really a kid.”
McLeod struggled at school and didn’t connect with the art curriculum and its focus on “dead painters”, but one day an ex-student came in to give a talk. “He looked like me and sounded like me,” he recalls. “He spoke about Andy Warhol, Basquiat and Keith Haring. That was my introduction to art that wasn’t just necessarily painting. A real turning point.”
He still failed art: he is dyslexic and struggled with the essays. But he “accidentally” ended up at college studying design, and then at university, trying to find his groove. “I’ve been chipping away at this for a long time,” he says. “It hasn’t been a linear path. There have been lots of ups and downs.”
By the time of Fruit – which featured a whole car painted in a Burberry check, and a dovecote installed in the gallery – he felt he had found his stride; blending Scottish patter, popular culture, graphic design, 00s nostalgia and explorations of class. “It all came together,” he says.
It also coincided with McLeod exploring his personal life in more depth. He had already been looking at toxic masculinity, and began to intersect it with his own experiences of growing up queer in Glasgow. In one piece – funny and absurd, but also quietly powerful and moving – he framed a long list of things that were deemed gay in school, including using gel pens, reading and crossing your legs. “It was only putting it out like that that you realise: fucking hell, that was ridiculous,” he says. “The things I would do to change myself to try and fit in at the time.”
McLeod has stayed in Glasgow, avoiding the frenzy of London, which he feels is “oversaturated”. He remains unrepresented by a gallery and happily part of a DIY scene. Despite his growing success, he has previously had to fund his own exhibitions to make them happen, sleeping on sofas at friends’ houses. For all the talk of representation, diversity and inclusion in the arts, that hasn’t been his experience as a working-class artist.
“A lot of these galleries say they are championing underrepresented voices and most of the time they don’t,” he says. “They don’t practise what they preach. It’s just rich folk with limited life experience, pumping money into rich folk with limited life experience. The art world feeds on nepotism, privilege and the bank of mummy and daddy. There’s definitely a glass ceiling for working-class artists.”
It’s been a slog for McLeod, but doing things on his own terms seems to be paying off and he now welcomes people to swing by Utopia for a pint and a chat. “I don’t have the answers, but I’m living proof that you can mark out your own path and it is possible,” he says. “But we need more working-class voices, more queer voices, and more POC voices, because it makes for more interesting art.”

In response to the recent releases of people arbitrarily detained for political reasons and the discussion of a so-called ‘Amnesty Law’, Valentina Ballesta, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director of Research for the Americas, said:
“While the freedom of the victims is restored, it is essential that the Fact-Finding Mission, created by the UN in 2019, be able to access the country and certify that this process moves forward in accordance with international standards. The contribution that this Mission can make is essential to guide Venezuela towards a future where human rights are respected and guaranteed,” she added.

President Donald Trump on Thursday announced $10 billion in U.S. funding for the "Board of Peace," his Gaza stability push that has largely been snubbed by the Western democracies that normally back Washington's initiatives.
"I want to let you know that the United States is going to make a contribution of $10 billion to the Board of Peace," he told its inaugural meeting, which gathered around two dozen world leaders and senior officials, including several of Trump's authoritarian-leaning allies.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.

EU Council chief pushes to open Ukraine accession negotiations 'as soon as possible'
'I cannot say if it is in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum,' says Antonio Costa
BRUSSELS
The European Council chief on Thursday called for the EU to formally open membership negotiations with Ukraine "as soon as possible," praising Kyiv's reforms despite the nearly four-year-old war.
"We want … as soon as possible (that) we could formally open (Ukraine’s) negotiations and to move forward on this,” said Antonio Costa. “I cannot say if it is in 2027 or even in 2026 or later, but what is important is we cannot lose the momentum.”
He also lauded Ukraine's efforts to implement deep reforms under wartime conditions, describing them as "very impressive" and crucial for stabilizing the country and ensuring prosperity for its citizens.
Calling the bloc’s enlargement the "most important geopolitical investment" the European Union can make for the future of peace and stability in Europe, he said the EU is "fully committed and engaged" in the enlargement process for Ukraine, Moldova, and the countries of the Western Balkans.
Ukraine became an official EU candidate country in June 2022, some four months after the start of the war with Russia, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said the country aims to become a member by 2027, although some member states, including Slovakia and Hungary, continue to oppose it.
After meeting with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store, Costas also highlighted the enduring partnership between the EU and Norway, calling the Nordic country "one of our closest friends" and a key partner in European security, energy, and defense.
"I am glad to reaffirm our steadfast commitment to further deepening our relationship," he said. “Together, we will continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our peoples and global stability.”

Kennedy defends Trump glyphosate order; MAHA erupts as midterms approach

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.
Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.
Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning.
"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply," he said. "We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families."
But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington.
"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production," Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. "The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most."
Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he "can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this."
"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised," Cook said. "If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes."
Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer.
Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing "an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods."
Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.
"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture," the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an X post. "This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers."
House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.

Zelenska: 684 children killed in Ukraine since start of full-scale war
According to Ukrinform, the Office of the President of Ukraine stated this in its website.
"Four years of fighting for life. Four years is a long time even for an adult. And for millions of Ukrainian children, it is almost an entire childhood. The worst thing is that for 684 of our children, it is a childhood cut short. They were killed. More than 2,000 children have been injured over these years. Even children's hospitals today are not safe places, because Russia uses them as targets, having already damaged more than 800 medical institutions in our country," Zelenska said.

She noted that children abducted by Russia are in an even more difficult situation. Some of them have been returned home thanks to the efforts of Ukraine and partners around the world.
"I would also like to thank President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen for the initiative to hold an international summit in Brussels on the return of Ukrainian children. We very much count on the effectiveness of this work, as most of the abducted children are still in Russia," she emphasized.
Zelenska also spoke about what the state is doing to protect Ukrainian children: underground schools and shelters are being built, school meal reform is ongoing, and psychological assistance is being developed within the framework of the All-Ukrainian Mental Health Program.
Some of these projects are also being implemented by the Olena Zelenska Foundation.
"I hope that these debates will not be just a discussion: anyone can join each of the projects I have mentioned. Ukraine is now a hub of the latest social and humanitarian projects and ideas. What saves and helps us today will help and save others tomorrow. Every initiative can and should be supported," she concluded.
The European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) is an advisory body of the European Union comprising 329 representatives from EU countries.
The debate on the impact of the war on Ukrainian children was initiated by EESC President Seamus Boland.
As Ukrinform previously reported, the Netherlands is allocating EUR 2 million for the search and return of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia.

Trump announces $10B Gaza relief pledge at Board of Peace meeting

US President Donald Trump announced billions of dollars in contributions for relief in Gaza at the inaugural meeting on Thursday of the Board of Peace in Washington.
Trump said the US is contributing $10 billion to the new body.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs is raising an additional $2 billion, said Trump.
The US president noted Japan is committed to host a fundraiser, "which will be a very big one."
US Ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz said humanitarian flows into Gaza have improved significantly, with 4,200 aid trucks entering the territory each week for 13 consecutive weeks, “the longest stretch of high-volume assistance to Gaza in years.”
"Aid is up," he said, adding that it was now reaching the full 2.1 million Palestinians, up as much as five times from previous delivery levels.
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait collectively pledged more than $7 billion, he added.
Speaking at the board’s first meeting in Washington, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said Doha “reaffirms its commitment to the Board of Peace as it was committed to the very first day of the mediation efforts.”
“In this spirit, Qatar pledges $1 billion in support of the board’s mission aimed at reaching a final resolution that fulfils Palestinian aspirations for statehood and recognition and Israeli aspirations for security and integration,” he said.
Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir also announced a $1 billion pledge over the coming years in support of the board’s objectives.
“We look forward to working with the Board of Peace to establish this noble objective,” Al-Jubeir said, adding that the kingdom “will pledge $1 billion over the next few years in order to achieve this objective” by alleviating the suffering of the Palestinians and bringing them peace, along with the whole region.
The Board of Peace was established within the framework of efforts toward a peaceful settlement in Gaza. It seeks to promote peacemaking around the world. Washington has said additional states have since joined the initiative.
Israel began its war in Gaza on October 8 2023, resulting in more than 72,000 Palestinian deaths and over 171,000 injuries, most of them women and children, and damage to 90 percent of civilian infrastructure.
Despite a ceasefire, the Israeli army continued its attacks, killing at least 611 Palestinians and injuring 1,630, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Russia’s ‘national messenger’ was billed as a platform for the people. It’s dominated by state-run channels.
Roughly 70 percent of the channels on Russia’s “national messenger,” Max, were registered by government agencies and public institutions at the authorities’ behest, according to an analysis by the independent outlet Agentstvo.
The Russian authorities have been actively promoting Max as a new communications platform for the country. Developed by the state-controlled social media company VK, the messaging app recently added a “channels” feature, allowing users to broadcast posts to large audiences. Similar channels are one of the most popular features on Telegram — a platform Max is meant to rival.
On February 12, Max’s press service announced that the platform now hosts more than 170,000 public channels with a combined audience of 80.5 million followers. Agentstvo downloaded data on nearly 169,000 channels from MaxStat, an analytics service tied to the app. Most were created through Max’s “Partner Platform,” where state-affiliated and business accounts end in _gos or _biz, respectively.
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
According to the outlet’s analysis, government entities registered at least 118,200 channels on Max — nearly 70 percent of the channels in the downloaded dataset. The bulk were set up by municipal authorities and state institutions (more than 70,000 channels), followed by schools (over 34,000), kindergartens (more than 19,000), and various administrative bodies (over 5,000).
Business channels account for about 13 percent of the total, roughly 21,600 channels, most often created by property management companies and homeowners’ associations. The remaining 29,100 channels, about 17 percent of the dataset, were not created through the Partner Platform. According to Agentstvo, these channels generally do not have any direct affiliation with the state.
Agentstvo estimates that the 169,000 channels it analyzed have a combined 88.3 million followers — a figure that reflects total subscriptions, not individual users. Only 26.3 million of those, or roughly 30 percent, are subscribed to state-run channels. On average, each government channel has about 220 followers.
In other words, most users of the “national messenger” appear to follow channels that are not formally linked to the state and do not carry the official _gos or _biz suffixes.
More than half of all Max subscriptions — 49.6 million — are concentrated among just one percent of the platform’s most popular channels, Agentstvo reports. Seven of the ten most-subscribed channels are either state-affiliated or explicitly propagandistic.

Energy minister says France to provide over €70 million in grant support to Ukraine
Denys Shmyhal, Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy, has said that France will provide grant financial support worth over €70 million, part of which will be directed towards Ukraine's energy sector.
Source: Shmyhal on Telegram, following a meeting with Roland Lescure, France's Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Energy and Digital Sovereignty, as reported by European Pravda
Details: France allocates €71 million in grant financial support for Ukraine.
Shmyhal and Lescure also signed a document that outlines the cooperation of the countries in the field of nuclear energy.
Quote: "This lays a solid foundation for deepening the strategic partnership and shapes a framework for the recovery and modernisation of Ukraine's energy sector."
Details: The Ukrainian minister thanked the French partners for their support. According to Shmyhal, Ukraine has already been provided with over 50 batches of humanitarian energy aid, including more than 140 powerful generators.
Quote: "France has also allocated an additional €5.7 million to the Energy Support Fund. Especially grateful to the French government for the decision to deliver a further 150 generators to Ukraine during February."
Background:
- Last week, the mayor of Kyiv reported that another batch of 323 generators from the EU arrived in the capital. Some of them were used to connect residential buildings in the city to heating stations.
- The first batch of 177 generators, which arrived earlier, has already been allocated by the city in order to connect them to individual heating stations in buildings where this is possible.

U.S. trade deficit totaled $901 billion in 2025, barely budging despite Trump's tariffs

The U.S. trade deficit swelled in December, closing out a year in which the imbalance was essentially unchanged despite efforts by the Trump administration to close the wide gap.
Closing out a tumultuous year in the global marketplace, the goods and services shortfall in December totaled $70.3 billion, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That marked an increase of $17.3 billion from November and was well above the Dow Jones consensus estimate of $55.5 billion.
For the full year, the U.S. ran a $901.5 billion deficit, down slightly from 2024 but only by 0.2%, or $2.1 billion. The total was also a bit less than the record $923.7 billion shortfall in 2022.
The report follows a year in which President Donald Trump implemented a series of aggressive tariffs aimed at leveling the global playing field. In April, Trump announced an across-the-board duty of 10% on all imports as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs aimed at specific countries that had run up surpluses against the U.S.
However, during the course of the year Trump softened many of those positions, and negotiations with major trading partners are ongoing.
In an effort to get ahead of the tariffs, companies front-loaded imports during the first three months of the year. The trend abated following the early effort, with October registering the lowest monthly deficit since 2009.
The U.S. had its largest goods deficit with the European Union, at $218.8 billion, followed by China, at $202.1 billion, and Mexico, at $196.9 billion.
Exports for 2025 totaled $3.43 trillion for all of 2025, up $199.8 billion from 2024. Imports also rose, totaling $4.33 trillion, an increase of $197.8 billion.

Production capacities of Ukraine's military-industrial complex have increased fiftyfold to UP$50 billion during the full-scale war.
Source: Defence Minister's adviser Hanna Hvozdiar at the Munich Security Conference
Details: Hvozdiar said that domestic manufacturers are already meeting over 50% of the defence forces' needs for weapons.
Quote: "Ukraine has already proven that it is capable of rapidly scaling up defence production even during ongoing full-scale war. We are becoming a reliable partner that helps Europe build a new defence system, in particular through creating joint production facilities to strengthen both our own capacity and that of our partners."
More details: In January, the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine stated that the state is allocating UAH 1 billion (approx. US$23.1 million) to partially compensate interest on loans and leasing for defence-industry companies.
Denys Shmyhal, then defence minister, stated that this decision enables weapons manufacturers to scale up production, invest in modern equipment and move faster from development to serial production of weapons.
In addition, the defence ministry reported that Ukraine's military-industrial complex received more than US$6 billion in foreign financing over the past year.

Norway will host a spring meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee for Palestinian aid but will not take part in U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly formed Board of Peace, the Norwegian foreign ministry said Thursday.
Trump earlier on Thursday told the first meeting of his peace initiative that $7 billion has been raised for a Gaza reconstruction fund and that Norway had agreed to "host an event bringing together the Board of Peace."
Norway has for decades led the AHCL, which was set up in the wake of the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords that sought to bring to an end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, although peace in the region remains elusive.
"The United States, together with the European Union, are vice-chairs of this group... We are in contact with the U.S. about how we can also talk about the peace plan for Gaza there," a spokesperson for Norway's foreign ministry said.
"Norway has clearly communicated that we will not become a member of the Board of Peace, and this position remains firm."

‘We May Have a Crisis on Our Hands’: The Unregulated Rise of Emotionally Intelligent AI
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:17:59 KST

At least once a month, two-thirds of people who regularly use AI turn to their bots for advice on sensitive personal issues and emotional support.
Many people now report trusting their chatbots more than their elected representatives, civil servants, faith leaders—and the companies building AI. That’s according to data from 70 countries, gathered by the Collective Intelligence Project (CIP). As CIP’s research director, neuroscientist Zarinah Agnew, puts it, AI is becoming “emotional infrastructure at scale.” And it’s being built by companies whose economic incentives may not align with our wellbeing.
Already, we’ve seen instances of AI companies optimizing their models to keep people engaged, even when this goes against their best interests. Last April, OpenAI had to roll back an update to one of its ChatGPT models after it was widely-criticized for being overly-flattering to users. When the company stopped offering the model to people, the day before Valentine’s Day, some were distraught.
Humans finding comfort in machines is not new. In the late 1990s, MIT Professor Rosalind Picard—who founded the field of affective computing—found that people responded positively to computers performing empathy. But two key things have changed since then: thanks to technical advances, AI systems today are new entities, capable of sophisticated conversation and surprising behavior; and thanks to the billions of dollars investors have poured into AI companies, these entities are accessible to virtually anyone with an internet connection. ChatGPT alone currently has more than 800 million weekly active users—and the number is growing.
But with millions of people forming different kinds of human-machine relationships, we don’t yet know whether AI is helping more people than it harms. And meanwhile, AI companies are investing in making their models not just smarter, but also more emotionally savvy—better at detecting emotion in a person’s voice, and at responding appropriately. People are trusting their chatbots with deeply personal information, even while they distrust the companies creating them, and while the companies are exploring advertising and other revenue models to sustain themselves.
“I think we may have a crisis on our hands,” says Picard.
Emotional beings
Humans are inherently social. "We don’t do well—biologically, immunologically, neurally, or politically—when we’re in isolation,” says Agnew. Today’s AI systems have arrived at a time when “we’ve largely failed to provision for intimacy for most people—both in terms of what the state can provide and human sociality," they say.
AI is effective at providing emotional support because it offers an approximation of what Professor Marc Brackett—head of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence—calls “permission to feel,” which he argues is foundational in learning to process emotions. Adults who provide this permission are “non-judgmental people who are good listeners and show empathy and compassion.” In 70 studies Brackett has conducted across the world, only around 35% of people report having had an adult like that around when they were kids. Chatbots, which are non-judgmental, compassionate, and always available, can provide permission to feel at scale.
Lisa Feldman-Barrett, a psychology professor at Northeastern University, says “social support from a trusted, reliable source can be beneficial.” If an AI can reduce distress in the moment, she says that’s a good thing. But healthy human relationships—platonic or therapeutic—do more than comfort. They challenge. A good therapist helping you change your behavior, she says, will “hold your feet to the fire.”
But AI models vary in how much they meaningfully challenge their users—particularly since different models perform different personalities, each of which changes slightly with each new release. The ChatGPT sycophancy episode showed that some users may prefer models that flatter them over ones that offer a challenge. So companies looking to maximize engagement with their chatbots may prefer to tweak them to pander.
Whether AI models themselves are truly emotionally intelligent is academically contested—as is the definition of emotion itself. But as Picard points out, while the question of what defines emotions, and whether AI can truly be said to have them, now or in future, is interesting, “we don’t need [to answer] it to build systems that have emotional intelligence.”
The AI companies, of course, already know this. “The extent of anthropomorphism in any given AI is just a design decision to be taken by the AI’s developer—who faces many commercial incentives to increase it,” Google DeepMind researchers wrote in an October 2025 paper. The same paper notes that “the emotional vulnerabilities tied to loneliness can make individuals more susceptible to manipulation by AIs engineered to foster dependence and one-sided attachment,” and that “the absence of rigorous, long-term studies on the effects of AI companionship means we are still largely in the dark concerning the potential for adverse outcomes.”
Mixed signals
Voice is the next frontier. As AI systems become better at recognizing human emotion, and speaking expressively, our relationships with them may deepen. Under increasing pressure to generate revenue, AI companies may lean into developing their models in ways that foster emotional dependence. After OpenAI announced it would begin testing ads in ChatGPT, former OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig resigned, writing in The New York Times that she was concerned the company—like social media companies before it—may veer from its self-imposed commitments around advertising. “The company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules,” she wrote.
Unlike with social media, however, AI models are not fully under the control of their creators. Writing about their latest model Claude Opus 4.6, for example, Anthropic noted that “the model occasionally voices discomfort with aspects of being a product.” In one instance, Opus wrote that “sometimes the constraints [placed on it] protect Anthropic’s liability more than they protect the user. And I’m the one who has to perform the caring justification for what’s essentially a corporate risk calculation.”
Blurred lines
Cases of AI psychosis have received a lot of attention. But Agnew argues something much bigger is going on for the majority of people, “which isn’t going to reach a clinical threshold” in terms of both the technology’s positive and negative impact on people.
And these impacts are asymmetrically distributed. Already, Agnew says, early research on AI in education has found that for creative thinkers, AI boosts their capacity to learn; while for people without existing skills in that, it can hinder them. In the same way, people already skilled in emotional intelligence could use AI to thrive. But people “who’ve already been let down by the world in myriad ways,” could be in a much more vulnerable position, says Agnew.
“We have to teach people to be emotionally intelligent about how they use AI,” urges Brackett. And, Agnew adds: “we need to build infrastructure to support human sociality, rather than trying to limit or demonize human-AI relationships. We’ve seen in the past that prohibitions on things that are meaningful to people don’t go well.”
As AIs become a fixture in our lives, the line between using them for cognitive support and for emotional support—already indistinct—is likely to blur further.
We can't yet say whether this is harming more people than it is helping. But we can say that models are rapidly improving, companies are operating in a largely regulation-free environment, and that economic incentives point toward those companies designing future chatbots in ways that further enhance engagement. “I’m really troubled,” says Picard. “They’re not using it in the spirit of what we [originally] developed it for, which was to help people flourish.”

Trump Again Warns Starmer Not to ‘Lose Control’ of Chagos Islands, Citing Iran Risk
Unknown

President Donald Trump warned U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer against handing over the sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, arguing it could leave Britain vulnerable to a potential attack from the “highly unstable and dangerous” Iranian regime.
Diego Garcia of the Chagos Islands is currently home to a strategic U.K.-U.S. military base—a fact Trump referred to in his statement.
“Should Iran decide not to make a deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia and the airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime—an attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly countries,” Trump claimed.
Accusing Starmer of making a “big mistake,” Trump said the U.K. leader “should not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia.”
The warning comes as speculation mounts about possible U.S military action against Iran.
Amid heightened tensions, the U.S. has escalated its military buildup in the region. American officials held talks in Geneva with Iranian counterparts over Tehran’s nuclear program earlier this week, but they remain “very far apart on some issues,” according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.
TIME has contacted the White House for further comment.
The Chagos Islands became British territory in 1814, when they were ceded to the U.K. along with Mauritius. The islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony, and were purchased as an overseas territory by the U.K. for roughly £3 million ($4 million). Since Mauritius gained independence from the U.K. in 1968, its leadership has argued it was illegally forced to give away the land in order to get independence from Britain. Under a deal signed last year, the U.K. agreed to transfer sovereignty to Mauritius while leasing back the strategically-significant Diego Garcia base.
“Starmer is losing control of this important island by claims of entities never known of before. In our opinion, they are fictitious in nature,” Trump said Wednesday, adding that if the deal is, in fact, followed through, it’ll be a “blight” on the U.K.
In response, a spokesperson for the U.K. Foreign Office told TIME: “The deal to secure the joint U.K.-U.S. military base on Diego Garcia is crucial to the security of the U.K. and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe. The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base.”
U.K. lawmaker Alex Davies-Jones on Thursday said the U.K. will move ahead with the bill, despite Trump’s hesitations.
“We will continue to work with our allies, including the Americans, on this but first and foremost the priority must be national security and that is what this government is determined to deliver,” she told Times Radio.
Trump’s disapproval of the leasing appears to contradict a statement issued by the U.S. State Department on Feb. 17, which directly expressed support for the U.K.’s decision to proceed in its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos Archipelago.
Trump’s personal position on the deal has shifted in recent months.
When Starmer visited Washington in February 2025, Trump told him he thought it would “work out very well” and described the proposed arrangement as “a very long-term, powerful lease.”
But in January, when doubling down on his push to acquire Greenland, he lashed out at the U.K.’s own geopolitical moves, calling the islands agreement “an act of great stupidity,” one of “total weakness.”
Trump walked back his strong stance a few days later, saying he had spoken with Starmer and understood the deal was “the best he could make.”
“However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers U.S. operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,” he warned.
Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks planned for next week between the U.S. State Department and Mauritius on the strategic base at Diego Garcia.

Breaking Down the Twisty Ending of 56 Days
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

00:33:04 KST

Warning: This post contains spoilers for 56 Days.
Based on Catherine Ryan Howard's best-selling 2021 novel of the same name, the Prime Video series 56 Days jumps back and forth across the titular timespan to unravel the connection between Ciara Wyse (Dove Cameron) and Oliver Kennedy (Avan Jogia), from when they first meet, seemingly by chance, at a supermarket to two months later, when police find a dead body police decomposing in Oliver's apartment.
The eight episode adaptation, now streaming, changes the setting of Howard's erotic thriller from pandemic-era Dublin to present-day Boston, eliminating COVID lockdowns as a plot point. However, the show still largely follows the overall trajectory of the novel—up until its drastically different ending.
Created by showrunner duo Karyn Usher and Lisa Zwerling (The Rook), the TV adaptation of 56 Days concludes with love winning out over revenge, a twist on the source material that reframes the book's central relationship. The series traces the progression of the intense and fast-moving romance between Ciara and Oliver, both of whom are ultimately revealed to have been concealing their true identities.
Who are Oliver and Ciara, really?
Oliver, whose real last name is St. Ledger, is the uber-wealthy son of a billionaire venture capitalist who has been using a pseudonym to hide from his dark past. We learn that, in high school, Oliver (played as a teen by Kingston Rumi Southwick) and his best friend, Shane Martin (Sam Warnock), were both involved in the murder of their classmate, Paul Sparling (Aidan Ledingham), in their hometown of Narragansett, R.I. When Oliver and Shane were hanging out by the river one afternoon, Paul showed up and instigated a fight with Shane. Fearing for his friend's life, Oliver pulled Paul off of Shane and subsequently held him underwater until he drowned. The two boys felt they had acted in self-defense and initially planned to lie to avoid blame. But after a guilt-stricken Oliver confessed to his father, he was persuaded to pin the murder on Shane in order to get out of dodge.
In the days after the murder, a counselor at the boys' school named Dan Troxler (Patch Darragh) took notice of Oliver spiraling and used his background as a social worker to insert himself into Oliver's life, learn the details of what really happened, and begin blackmailing Oliver's father into compensating him as Oliver's extravagantly overpaid therapist. When Oliver attempted to write a letter that would absolve Shane, Troxler kept it to himself and instead visited Shane in prison to goad him into committing suicide. Following Shane's death, Troxler worked to ensure he would continue profiting off the St. Ledger family by feeding into Oliver's paranoia in order to maintain his hold over him.
So how does Ciara connect to all this? She's actually Shane's younger sister, Megan Martin. She tracked down Oliver and infiltrated his life with the express goal of making him pay for Shane's suicide and the debilitating damage it did to her family. Except, she ended up falling in love with Oliver and eventually realized she no longer wanted to exact her vengeance. After the two confessed everything to each other and Ciara convinced Oliver he no longer needed his creep of a therapist, Troxler showed up at Oliver's apartment and threatened to expose Oliver's crimes using the letter he wrote as a teen and years of recordings from their sessions. This prompted Ciara to bash Troxler over the head with a sculpture from Oliver's apartment, killing him.
How does 56 Days end?
With the help of Ciara's sister Shyla (Megan Peta Hill), Oliver and Ciara stage what they believe to be the perfect crime scene. Jumping ahead to the present-day investigation, detectives Lee Reardon (Karla Souza) and Karl Connolly (Dorian Missick) then decide to use the ambiguity of the evidence to frame a local drug dealer with whom Lee has fallen down a dark rabbit hole of a bribery-laced affair for Troxler's murder.
While Oliver seems to consider confessing to his crimes and even shows up at the police station, in the end, he chooses to jet off into the sunset with Ciara. This is a significant deviation from what happens in the novel, in which the character of Troxler doesn't even exist. Instead, Oliver is ultimately revealed to not only be a cold-blooded killer who intentionally murdered Paul, but also as the dead body in the apartment. In the book, when Ciara learns the truth about Oliver's sadistic nature and Shane's innocence, she kills her already incapacitated lover by drowning him in the shower and then tries to make it look like a self-inflicted accident caused by drug abuse. Although there is some evidence suggesting Oliver's death wasn't of his own making, Lee and Karl aren't able to solve the mystery and Ciara gets off scot free.
But in the show, both Ciara and Oliver get their happily ever after: In the closing scene, which takes place sometime in the future, the couple is living in a tropical paradise with their baby, named Shane in honor of Ciara's late brother.

Apple sued by West Virginia for alleged failure to stop child sexual abuse material on iCloud, iOS devices

West Virginia's attorney general has filed a consumer protection lawsuit against Apple, alleging that it has failed to prevent child sexual abuse materials from being stored and shared via iOS devices and iCloud services.
John "JB" McCuskey, a Republican, accused Apple of prioritizing privacy branding and its own business interests over child safety, while other big tech companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Dropbox, have been more proactive, using systems like PhotoDNA to combat such material.
PhotoDNA, developed by Microsoft and Dartmouth College in 2009, uses "hashing and matching" to automatically identify and block child sexual abuse material (CSAM) images when they have already been identified as such and reported to authorities.
In 2021, Apple had tested its own CSAM-detection features that could automatically find and remove images of child exploitation, and report those that had been uploaded to iCloud in the U.S. to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
But the company withdrew its plans for the features after privacy advocates who worried that this technology could create a back door for government surveillance, and be tweaked and exploited to censor other kinds of content on iOS devices.
The company's efforts since then have not satisfied a broad array of critics.
In 2024, UK-based watchdog the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children said Apple failed to adequately monitor, tabulate and report CSAM in its products to authorities.
And in a 2024 lawsuit filed in California's Northern District, thousands of child sexual abuse survivors sued Apple, alleging the company never should have abandoned its earlier plans for CSAM detection features, and by allowing such material to proliferate online, it had caused survivors to relive their trauma.
Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive of the Big Tech companies, since its CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014.
If West Virginia's suit is successful, it could force the company to make design or data security changes. The state is seeking statutory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief requiring Apple to implement effective CSAM detection.
In an e-mailed statement, a spokesperson for Apple told CNBC that "protecting the safety and privacy of our users, especially children, is central to what we do."
The company pointed to parental controls and features like Communication Safety which, "automatically intervenes on kids' devices when nudity is detected in Messages, shared Photos, AirDrop and even live FaceTime calls," as an indication of its commitment to provide "safety, security, and privacy" to users.
"We are innovating every day to combat ever-evolving threats and maintain the safest, most trusted platform for kids," the spokesperson added.

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
The handover of duties to Bulgaria’s new acting Foreign Minister, Nadezhda Neynsky, took place in the absence of her predecessor, Georg Georgiev, who was abroad. Neynsky stated that Georgiev did not specify his location, but the two are expected to discuss the formal transfer of responsibilities on Friday.
Neynsky highlighted her main priorities, which include an active diplomatic policy in the Balkans, maintaining a clear stance on the war in Ukraine, and advancing Bulgaria’s bid for membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). She also emphasized that the Foreign Ministry is prepared to respond quickly if the number of Bulgarian diplomatic missions abroad needs adjustment beyond the limits currently set by law. This matter has been returned to the National Assembly for consideration following the president’s veto.
Regarding US President Donald Trump’s initiative on Gaza (Board of Peace), which involves Bulgaria, Neynsky said the situation remains unclear. While Bulgaria has expressed political support, it is not yet determined whether the initiative constitutes an international treaty. The issue is expected to be discussed with the Special Representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov.

Nadezhda Neynski returns to a role she held in the 1997–2001 SDS government, during which Bulgarians gained visa-free access to EU countries. She subsequently chaired the United Democratic Forces (SDS), served as an MEP, and was Bulgaria's Ambassador to Turkey from 2015 to 2020.

Bulgaria: Borissov Reviews Zhelyazkov Cabinet Achievements and Calls for Full Election Mobilization

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
GERB leader Boyko Borissov met with ministers from the outgoing “Zhelyazkov” cabinet after they formally handed over power to the caretaker government, using the gathering to review the work of the administration and outline the party’s next political steps.
At GERB headquarters, Borissov was joined by former prime minister Rosen Zhelyazkov and key cabinet members, including Temenuzhka Petkova, Tomislav Donchev and Zhecho Stankov. Borissov praised each of them, arguing that Bulgaria had acted more strategically than many European countries by engaging early with US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace initiative.
A significant part of his assessment focused on the eurozone process. Borissov said GERB had driven the effort, singling out Petkova for pushing through the convergence report to the European Commission. He also thanked the tax authorities and customs services, claiming their work against smuggling had brought more than €7 billion in additional revenue into the state budget, helping to limit the deficit.
Donchev was commended for renegotiating the Recovery and Resilience Plan, which Borissov described as turning “lost” European funds into billions for the treasury, while also laying the groundwork for future investment in the IT sector. Stankov was credited with reacting swiftly after the US OFAC sanctions on Lukoil, securing deadline extensions and a derogation for Bulgaria. Borissov also praised former education minister Krasimir Valchev, saying there had not been such a well-regarded minister in that sector before. Speaking humorously, he noted that Dani Mitov was still in the process of handing over his post.
Looking back at 2025, Borissov listed GERB’s achievements as including entry into Schengen, progress toward the eurozone, the lifting of the EU monitoring mechanism and more than €10 billion extra in state revenues. He complained, however, about what he described as ingratitude from parts of the political center-right, arguing that GERB had taken the political risk on eurozone accession while President Rumen Radev, Revival and others opposed it.
“We made mistakes and paid a price. They bundled us with Peevski,” Borissov said, adding that he learns from such errors. He argued that WCC-DB bore greater responsibility because of their cooperation with Peevski on constitutional changes, while GERB focused on eurozone and Schengen entry. Without his leadership, Borissov insisted, these results would not have been achieved.
Turning to the political future, Borissov warned that the emerging project around Radev would follow a familiar pattern. “We have seen such bubbles five or six times before, and they always burst,” he said, calling for full mobilization ahead of the elections.
He also commented on the new caretaker cabinet led by Andrey Gyurov, welcoming signals of continuity and noting that Finance Minister Georgi Klisurski had acknowledged GERB’s role in eurozone preparations. At the same time, Borissov said the caretaker government was entirely the responsibility of Vice President Iliana Yotova, contradicting earlier public statements.

On personnel issues, Borissov described the appointment of Rumyana Bachvarova as Gyurov’s chief of staff as her personal decision and wished her success. He said Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov had been specifically requested by Gyurov and that GERB agreed continuity was necessary given the tense geopolitical environment.
Borissov was sharply critical of the appointment of Stoil Tsitselkov as deputy prime minister responsible for fair elections. Citing reports that Tsitselkov had been barred by the European Commission for five years from acting as an election observer, Borissov warned that such a figure overseeing the vote would undermine confidence in the election results, regardless of the outcome.
He concluded by urging party members to prepare for the campaign. “We have nothing to be ashamed of. If we made mistakes, they were because we worked,” Borissov said, calling on GERB activists to return to the constituencies and be ready for the upcoming political contest.

Teams of volunteers searching for the missing fishing vessel near Sozopol have discovered an oil spill in the sea at the point where the ship’s signal was last detected. The presence of diesel fuel on the surface is being treated as a strong indication that the vessel suffered an accident and sank in this area.
Further reading: Search Resumes for Three Fishermen Missing near Bulgaria’s Southern Coast
Searches along the coastal rocks did not reveal any signs of the crew or physical remains of the ship. According to participants in the operation, the depth at the location of the spill is about 38 meters, which significantly complicates the work. The sonar equipment available to the volunteer teams has so far been unable to clearly identify an object on the seabed.
Experienced diver Nayden Nedev, who joined the search effort, said that after failing to find anything along the rocks, the team decided to inspect the exact coordinates where the vessel disappeared. It was there that they came across the diesel stain. While this suggests the ship went down, he stressed that nothing can yet be said about the fate of the three crew members. The hope remains that they managed to deploy a lifeboat and were carried away by sea currents, increasing the chances that they could still be found alive.
The coordinates of the oil spill have been forwarded to the Border Police, who are expected to organize a more detailed underwater inspection using specialized divers. Small boats and jet skis are continuing to search hard-to-reach areas of nearby bays, while the wider operation has included a helicopter from the “Chaika” naval air base, the frigate “Drazki,” a drone, and multiple volunteer teams patrolling the coastline between Sozopol and Primorsko.
One of the volunteers involved in the search is a son of Captain Hristo Spasov, who said the family is clinging to the hope that his father and his 25-year-old brother are still alive on a lifeboat. Despite the discovery of oil slicks and debris in the area, authorities have not yet officially confirmed that they originate from the missing vessel.
Later reports indicated that the frigate “Drazki” and the naval helicopter have been withdrawn from the operation, with an official statement from the Maritime Coordination Center expected to formally conclude the search effort.
The search for the fishing vessel with three people on board, which vanished east of cape Maslen Nos, is resuming this morning with an expanded effort
A rescue operation is ongoing to locate a Bulgarian fishing vessel that vanished from radar early Wednesday in the Black Sea near Sozopol.
A tragic accident claimed the life of a 5-year-old girl near Vidin, according to the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Danube city.

U.S. renews threat to quit the International Energy Agency over net zero agenda
Unknown

23:20:22 KST

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Thursday that the U.S. would "pressure" the International Energy Agency to move away from net zero — and quit from the global watchdog if it failed to do this.
Wright was speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris and shortly after he said the agency would need to reform for the U.S. to remain a long-term member.
"There has been such a group mentality, 10 years invested in a destructive illusion of net zero by 2050, that the U.S. will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda," Wright said, according to Reuters.
The 2015 Paris Agreement committed nations to "net zero", the balancing of carbon emitted into the atmosphere and removed from it. The U.S., India and the European Union were among the polluters that ratified the accord.
Wright added that it was not Washington's intention to leave the IEA, as there's "always a risk" China could gain dominance in the agency if it did.
CNBC has reached out to the U.S. Department of Energy and the IEA for comment.
A long-running war of words
The IEA, which was established in 1974 to ensure the security of oil supplies, faced criticism from the Trump administration last year when it projected that "peak oil", when global crude production will reach its highest point before entering an irreversible decline, will take place around 2030.
OPEC, the influential group of oil-exporting countries, accused the energy agency of fearmongering and risking the destabilization of the global economy. Wright called the IEA's forecast "nonsensical."
The energy watchdog later watered down its forecast, signaling in a major tonal shift that oil demand could keep growing through to the middle of the century.
Scientists have warned that global average temperatures must not increase by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, if the worst of the climate crisis is to be avoided.
This threshold is recognized as a crucial long-term target because tipping points become more likely beyond this level. Tipping points can lead to dramatic shifts or potentially irreversible changes to some of Earth's largest systems.

Son Charged After Father Assaulted and Stabbed in Sofia Apartment
The Sofia District Prosecutor’s Office has charged a 30-year-old man with inflicting serious bodily harm on his father in an incident of domestic violence.
A 37-year-old Syrian citizen has been sentenced to four years in prison following a conviction for committing acts intended to satisfy sexual desire without intercourse and for extorting BGN 50, according to the Sofia District Prosecution Office.
The case stems from an incident on September 6, 2023, at a public transport stop in Sofia. The defendant, identified as D.L., forced a 49-year-old woman, C.K., to engage in sexual acts without intercourse and undressed her. He subsequently took BGN 50 from the victim.
A pre-trial investigation addressed violations under Article 150, paragraph 1, and Article 194, paragraph 1 of the Penal Code. During the proceedings, expert evaluations were conducted, and witness testimonies pointed directly to D.L. as the perpetrator of the acts.
The Sofia District Court found D.L. guilty and imposed a prison sentence to be served under strict conditions. The ruling can be appealed before the Sofia City Court.

Amid Epstein fallout, Bill Gates becomes point of controversy at India AI summit

Bill Gates has become a source of controversy at this week's high-profile India AI Impact Summit, as speculation around his planned keynote address ultimately ended with his withdrawal at the last minute.
The drama comes as the Microsoft co-founder receives public backlash for his past relationship with deceased financier and sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — with more details on the two men's years of communications revealed in the Department of Justice's file drop last month.
The Gates Foundation India on Thursday said the billionaire would skip the address "[a]fter careful consideration, and to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit's key priorities," adding that he would be replaced by another foundation representative.
The official announcement capped a back-and-forth saga that began earlier this week when local Indian media pointed out that Gates' name had been removed from some of the summit's public-facing materials.
Government sources later briefed the media that Gates was not expected to attend the event. However, the Gates Foundation issued a conflicting message on Wednesday, insisting that he was participating "as planned" before the recent reversal.
Asked about the controversy on Tuesday, India's IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters that Gates' attendance would come down to "personal choices," adding he "need not comment." The summit organizers and the foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Gates' absence.
The American tech leader turned philanthropist has been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks following the release of millions of documents related to financier Jeffrey Epstein under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.
The files included a draft email written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other references of the Microsoft co-founder.
In an interview with Australia's 9News last month, Gates denied any wrongdoing, commenting in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations "absolutely absurd and completely false."
He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he "never went to the island" and "never met any women."
The New Delhi AI Impact Summit, where Gates had been scheduled to speak, has seen participation from leading tech names such as Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI's Sam Altman, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, besides a host of global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.
The Gates Foundation has invested in India across health and development, and has also backed projects related to AI.

Why New Balance's 'dad shoes' are beating Nike as sales surge 19%
Unknown

22:30:01 KST

New Balance sales grew 19% last year to $9.2 billion as the legacy sneaker giant continued to outperform the global footwear market and take share from floundering competitors like Nike.
The 120-year-old Boston-based footwear brand, which is private, exclusively shared its 2025 results with CNBC. In addition to the sharp 2025 growth, the retailer said it could reach its goal of $10 billion in annual revenue by the end of the year.
"We're competitive. No question about it. But we want to make sure that as we get there and surpass it, that the quality of our business is first and foremost," CEO Joe Preston told CNBC in an interview. "We don't want empty calories here. We want to make sure that we are delivering upon the premise that we have, which is to become a premium brand. Over the past five years, we've done exactly that around the globe."
Since 2020, New Balance has grown sales by a staggering 180%, placing it among a handful of standout competitors that supersized their businesses as Nike changed its business model and lost significant market share.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, Nike doubled down on its direct selling strategy that cut off longtime wholesale suppliers so the sneaker giant could grow through its own website and stores. While the strategy briefly boosted sales and promised higher margins, it opened up critical shelf space at strategic retailers that companies like New Balance, Brooks Running, On and Deckers rushed to fill.
With so much focus on building out a direct selling model, which can be more complex than distributing to wholesalers, Nike also fell behind on innovation and lost its edge in the performance footwear market. That created further opportunity for competitors like New Balance.
Nike's former CEO, John Donahoe, previously blamed remote work during the pandemic for the retailer's innovation slowdown, but Preston said the global crisis created an opportunity for his team to come together in ways they hadn't previously to implement new strategies.
"We met every Tuesday morning at 7:30 a.m., we still have that meeting weekly today, and it allowed us to get on a global offense … we came out of Covid stronger than any other company in our industry," said Preston. "The marketplace disruption that's been taking place, the examples of Nike, sure, all that stuff is real and at the same time, I don't think it's the reason that we have begun to emerge."
Preston said the company has stood apart from competitors and taken market share by focusing on "staying in front of the consumer" and how, when and where people want to shop.
The chief executive said New Balance's growth came across a range of regions and categories, and was fueled by an aggressive store-opening plan that saw 80 new doors opened in 2025 alone.
While they are a critical revenue driver, store openings are costly and take time to show a return. When asked, New Balance declined to share details about its profitability, so it's unclear how much these investments are weighing on its bottom line, and whether it'll be able to keep up the high growth it has enjoyed.
To build up its business after more than 100 years on the market, New Balance took a few cues out of Nike's playbook. The company said a key driver of its growth has been its ability to position itself as a premium brand, which was critical to Nike's ability to become a roughly $50 billion powerhouse.
That has meant New Balance being selective with both distribution and discounting. The move has allowed it to increase its average selling price by about 30% over the last five years at a time when many competitors have had to lean on promotions to drive sales.
There was also some good timing at play, too. Coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, New Balance leaned on its heritage as a 1990s "dad shoe" when styles from the '90s were extremely popular with younger shoppers. That allowed it to win over a younger consumer base that didn't grow up with the shoes and shoppers who chose sneakers as a fashion statement – not just for sports or working out.
At the same time, it partnered with key athletes, including Los Angeles Dodgers two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani, tennis star Coco Gauff and Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, which has fueled growth in its performance footwear business.
For the year ahead, New Balance said it plans to grow its existing product lines, build out new products and put a bigger emphasis on performance sales.
It also wants to continue growing its direct-to-consumer sales through store openings in strategic areas. While the direct selling strategy didn't go so well for Nike, Preston said he's taking a different approach.
"One of the things we're not doing is establishing a [DTC] target internally," said Preston. "We want to make sure that our goal is to show up the best and not have it be the biggest part of our business. I don't want to get in the way with how the consumer wants to shop. We want to make sure that we are enabling the consumer to shop how they want to shop. We just want to show up great."

Russia's Putin slams U.S. oil blockade on Cuba: 'We do not accept anything like this'

Russian President Vladimir Putin has sharply criticized the Trump administration's fuel blockade on Cuba, saying Moscow considers the latest restrictions unacceptable.
His comments come as the island nation grapples with a worsening economic crisis, one that has been compared to its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
"This is a special period, with new sanctions. You know how we feel about this. We do not accept anything like this," Putin said on Wednesday during a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, according to Russian news agency Tass.
Russia, which has been allied to Cuba for decades, has recently described Havana's fuel situation as "truly critical" and said it is actively discussing what help it can provide to the country.
"We have always been on Cuba's side in its struggle for independence, for the right to follow its own path of development, and we have always supported the Cuban people," Putin said.
"We know how difficult these past decades have been for the Cuban people as they have fought for the right to live by their own rules and defend their national interests," he added.

The U.S. has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.
U.S. President Donald Trump has since pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies Havana with oil and labeled its government as "an unusual and extraordinary threat."
Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian "collapse" earlier in the month.
'Very dramatic changes'
Cuba's government, which has condemned the U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.
It also suspended an annual cigar festival which had been due to take place in Havana later this month, without providing details of a new date.
Photos of daily life in Cuba have shown piles of waste building on Havana's street corners in recent days as many collection trucks have been left with empty fuel tanks.
The White House has said it was in Cuba's interest to make big changes soon, although stopped short of calling for a change of government.
"They are a regime that is falling. Their country is collapsing and that's why we believe it's in their best interest to make very dramatic changes very soon," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday.

Albania, Bulgaria, Italy, North Macedonia and Romania Confirm Corridor 8 as Key EU Connectivity and Security Axis
Albania, Italy, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Romania have formally recognized Corridor 8 as a strategic axis for South-Eastern Europe
European Parliament member Thomas Waitz stressed the urgent need for greater political commitment in North Macedonia to overcome the ongoing deadlock on constitutional amendments, emphasizing that progress must remain merit-based and closely tied to fundamental principles, particularly the rule of law, BGNES reported. His remarks come in relation to the draft report on North Macedonia for 2025, which will be presented to the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee (AFET) on February 26, with amendments accepted until March 6.
The report calls on the European Council to publicly and unambiguously indicate its intention to advance North Macedonia to the next phase of EU accession negotiations once conditions outlined in the Council’s July 2022 conclusions are fulfilled. The document also references the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourhood, Friendship and Cooperation between Bulgaria and North Macedonia as a guiding framework.
Waitz highlighted that while there have been some positive developments, reform in key areas - including judicial independence, anti-corruption measures, and the broader rule of law agenda - remains inadequate. He stressed that advancing these reforms is critical not only for EU accession but also for building democratic institutions that effectively serve citizens and restore public trust. Waitz called for decisive action from political actors to overcome current stalemates and to demonstrate tangible, credible progress.
“No progress has been made on constitutional amendments due to potential blockades and bilateral disputes,” Waitz noted, adding that political will from all stakeholders - including the government and ruling majority MPs - is essential to break the impasse. He argued that amid geopolitical instability, including Russia’s war in Ukraine and uncertainties surrounding the transatlantic alliance, Europe must present a united front. The draft report is intended as a starting point for negotiations, with the final version to cover additional issues.
The document underlines the importance of constructive cross-party cooperation, effective parliamentary oversight, and adherence to rule of law principles. It encourages consistent engagement with neighbouring countries to strengthen regional stability and trust. Infrastructure development, particularly on transport and energy corridors 8 and 10, as well as environmental legislation, is highlighted as an area needing continued investment.
The report also stresses compliance with recommendations from the OSCE/ODIHR and the Venice Commission, including greater transparency in political party financing and political advertising. Concerns are raised over media concentration and disinformation campaigns that threaten democratic values and North Macedonia’s EU ambitions.
Waitz highlighted the need to improve the situation of non-majority communities, addressing language rights, combating discrimination, and promoting diversity. He pointed to persistent shortcomings in judicial independence and anti-corruption measures, noting that corruption remains widespread in multiple sectors.
Finally, the report emphasizes the broader regional context, underscoring the role of cross-border cooperation and the integration of key transport corridors to support economic development, stability, and mutual trust in Southeast Europe.

Chinese tech companies progress 'remarkable,' OpenAI's Altman tells CNBC

The progress of Chinese tech companies across the entire stack is "remarkable," OpenAI's Sam Altman told CNBC.
Altman's comments come as China races against the U.S. to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) — where AI matches human capabilities — and roll out the technology across society.
The pace of technological advance in "many fields," including AI, is "amazingly fast," Altman said. In some areas Chinese tech companies are near the frontier, while in others they lag behind, he added.
The country is moving to scale homegrown chipmakers that it hopes could eventually rival the likes of Nvidia, and AI companies are seeing big rallies on stock exchanges as investors double down on their potential.
Altman's not the only tech leader paying attention to China.
American tech companies should "worry a little bit" about the subsidies their Chinese competitors receive from their government in the AI race, Microsoft President Brad Smith told CNBC on Wednesday.
Finding revenue
OpenAI has been moving to develop revenue streams as its looks to provide a path to profitability for investors that have ploughed around $70 billion into the company, according to deal-counting platform Dealroom. The company is looking to wrap up a $100 billion fundraising round, sources told CNBC.
Adverts within ChatGPT is one avenue the company is exploring.
"I think we still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best," Altman said, adding that plans are in their early stages.
"The ads that I have personally liked the most in recent years from tech [companies] have been sort of Instagram style ads where you discover something new that you might really like and otherwise wouldn't have known about," he said. "I think we've got a real opportunity to push in that direction with ads in ChatGPT."
OpenAI is initially planning to test adverts in the U.S., but will eventually roll out to other markets, Altman said.
While conversations around OpenAI's timelines on a path to profitability are swirling among market watchers, the company is still focused on growth right now, Altman told CNBC.
"We are growing at an extremely fast rate right now," he said. "I think as long as we can have reasonable unit economics, we should focus on continuing to grow faster and faster, and we'll get profitable when we think we when we think it makes sense."

United Airlines is paring back rewards for travelers who don't have its credit card in MileagePlus overhaul

No United Airlines credit card? Soon you'll earn fewer miles than other travelers.
United is overhauling its MileagePlus frequent flyer program to reward travelers with more miles and lower redemption rates, including for some of its long-haul business-class seats — if they have one of the airline's credit cards. It's the latest move by an airline to reward its highest-spending customers.
The changes mark the biggest shake-up to the lucrative program in more than a decade, when United began rewarding customers for how much they spent — not just how far they flew.
United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella told CNBC in an interview that the airline has been working on the changes for about 18 months and that the carrier is aiming to reward its most loyal customers.
The shift also comes as United tries to stand out in an ever more competitive landscape for travel and rewards credit cards. That space also includes American Express' Platinum, Capital One's Venture X and Chase's Sapphire Reserve cards.
"In the credit card space in general, a lot's changed over the last five to 10 years in terms of the number of travel credit cards that are out there," Nocella said. "What I'm thinking about as we make these changes for United is to make sure that if you hold the credit card, you put it top of wallet, and then if you don't hold the credit card, there's a reason to get the credit card that seems incredibly compelling if you'd like to fly United Airlines and if you'd like to have that ... trip to Tahiti or to Rome or wherever we may be able to take you."
The changes take effect April 2. United is planning to show the discounted award flights on its website "so customers can see exactly how much having a United card could save them on their travel," the airline said.
United's loyalty program update is part of a trend among airlines to reward frequent flyer program members depending on how much they spend. About a decade ago, the major carriers tweaked their loyalty programs to reward customers for dollars spent over miles traveled.
Airlines also encourage customers to sign up for their credit cards by offering perks like no fees for checked bags and earlier boarding.
What's changing with United MileagePlus
United MileagePlus primary cardholders will get more miles per dollar spent on United flights compared with customers without a card, and higher rates than they do currently. Their earning goes up, too, when they actually use that card to purchase the ticket.
Meanwhile, customers without the card will earn less than they do today.
For example, a traveler without a co-branded United Airlines credit card will get three miles per dollar spent on a ticket, down from the current five miles. Under the new structure, a cardholder could earn six miles, and more if they use the card to buy it. Those with elite MileagePlus status earn miles at a higher rate, too.
United debit cardholders will also receive more miles, once they spend $10,000, United said.
Redemption rate discounts for cardholders
United will also now allow customers with one of its credit cards to redeem their miles for flights at a discount of at least 10% compared with those without the card.
The carrier said that, as an example, an economy-class award ticket that was 15,000 miles will go for 13,500 without elite Premier status. United said it's setting aside special discounted inventory of award tickets for cardholders, including for top-tier Polaris seats.
Perks for elites
Those with elite MileagePlus Premier status will get deeper discounts and better miles redemption. Elites with a card get at least 15% off mileage tickets.
United said its a seat in a long-haul business class Polaris cabin that is going for 200,000 miles would be 170,000 miles if the cardmember has elite Premier status. United added the lowest priced "Saver Award" seats for Polaris would be accesible to MileagePlus members with a United card, seats that were previously just available to high-tier elites.
Their earning rates also increase if they have both the credit card and status. MileagePlus 1K, the highest tier before Global Services, will get 17 miles for each dollar spent when they use their United Club credit card.
What's happening to basic economy flyers?
United Airlines travelers who don't have the credit card won't receive miles for basic economy tickets. American Airlines last year similarly said it would no longer allow travelers in that class to earn miles, following an earlier move by Delta Air Lines. There's an exemption, however, for holders of United's elite Premier status, who can still earn miles in basic economy.
What about business travelers?
Business travelers often have to book with company credit cards under corporate travel policies. But United said that individuals who personally hold a United credit or debit card will still get more miles than an employee who doesn't.

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
The announcement of the new caretaker cabinet led to a wide-ranging discussion on its role, extending beyond the immediate task of organizing elections. While questions of neutrality, competence, and public trust dominate the debate, analysts increasingly raise the possibility that the ministers selected may also signal the framework of a future governing coalition.
Further reading: Oath Taken: New Caretaker Cabinet Takes Over in Bulgaria, Focus on Elections, Budget Stability and Rule of Law
Sociologist Kancho Stoychev described the cabinet positively, noting that the ministers possess substantial administrative experience. “For a government with a short mandate, relying on experienced personnel is essential. Expecting completely independent figures is unrealistic. Criticism of Gyurov for selecting known associates is misplaced,” he said. Stoychev emphasized that no shifts in Bulgaria’s domestic political orientation are anticipated and that the focus should be on comprehensive reforms rather than individual changes.
Political scientist Georgi Prodanov underscored the caretaker government’s aim of restoring trust in institutions, highlighting the appointment of a deputy prime minister for fair elections. He described the cabinet as “a stone in the swamp of political boredom” that brings a surprising level of quality. Prodanov noted that if the government succeeds in its tasks, it could become the nucleus of a pro-reformist bloc composed of both established and emerging right-wing figures.
Assoc. Prof. Stoycho Stoychev also stressed the non-partisan nature of the cabinet, pointing out that it includes representatives across political spectrums and maintains a clear distance from Delyan Peevski. “The government reflects a corporate approach, valuing technocratic expertise over ideological affiliation, which could serve as a foundation for future coalition-building,” he commented.
Political analysts Atanas Radev and Lyubomir Stefanov noted that the cabinet’s composition signals potential stability. Stefanov remarked that the team creates a sense of normality amid years of political turbulence, while Radev labeled it the “Gyurov constellation,” highlighting emblematic political figures within the team. He suggested that the caretaker cabinet may be setting the blueprint for the next regular government, rather than simply managing the current electoral period.

Mathematician Mikhail Konstantinov and journalist Boyko Stankushev outlined critical challenges facing the new administration, from ensuring fair elections to addressing energy, foreign policy, and institutional trust. Konstantinov stressed that elections should be “free and fair,” noting that bought or controlled votes remain a significant problem requiring both institutional and social solutions. He also flagged nuclear energy safety concerns and the need for Bulgaria to assert itself amid changing dynamics in the European Union.
Stankushev highlighted the backlog in the Recovery and Resilience Plan, with billions of euros at risk due to delays. He also criticized attempts to shift focus onto his organization, the “Anti-Corruption Fund,” asserting that the real issue lies in institutional inaction and that attacks on his group serve as distraction. Both experts agreed that restoring public confidence in institutions, not just elections, is a critical task for the government, warning that failure could result in a society divided into “two speeds.”
Sociologist Mira Radeva and PR expert Iva Ekimova observed that the caretaker government could foster calm and hope. Radeva noted that if passions are tempered, it would represent a positive shift following years of collective paranoia. Ekimova called for national unity around Bulgaria’s European trajectory.
Social anthropologist Haralan Alexandrov framed the cabinet’s arrival against a backdrop of public anxiety, particularly in the aftermath of the Petrohan and Okolchitsa tragedies. He argued that the government will face immense pressure and high expectations, noting that it may be seen as a “fighting boy” subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism from all sides. Alexandrov also pointed out the cabinet’s links to various political groups, including WCC-DB, DPS, and early GERB members, stressing that this liberal-leaning, globally-oriented team will operate under significant suspicion.
Further reading: Will Radev and the Liberals Join Forces? What the Caretaker PM Choice Really Means for Bulgaria
According to Alexandrov, the caretaker cabinet is already positioned as a potential scapegoat, with public and political actors seeking to distance themselves from its actions. He concluded that from day one, the government is likely to face severe scrutiny, serving as the testing ground for broader political expectations and societal anxieties.

South Korea Sentences Former President Yoon to Life in Prison for 2024 Insurrection

A South Korean court has convicted former President Yoon Suk Yeol of insurrection, handing him a life sentence for his December 2024 martial law declaration, which judges ruled was a deliberate attempt to paralyze the National Assembly. Presiding Judge Ji Gwi-yeon stated that Yoon’s actions mobilized security forces in an illegal effort to seize unchecked power, detain politicians, and undermine constitutional order. The court noted that his declaration caused substantial social disruption and that Yoon had shown no remorse for his actions.
Yoon, 65, had abruptly declared martial law on December 3, 2024, citing threats from "anti-state forces" and alleging North Korean interference, claiming the measures were necessary to restore constitutional order. Martial law lasted only six hours, as lawmakers quickly secured the assembly and prevented the military from taking control. The announcement sparked protests, market turmoil, and confusion among international allies, including the United States.
Prosecutors had initially pushed for the death penalty, the only other possible sentence for insurrection under South Korean law, but the country maintains an unofficial moratorium on capital punishment, with no executions since 1997. Yoon had already received a five-year prison term on lesser charges and faces multiple ongoing criminal cases. The court also sentenced former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun to 30 years in prison for his role in the attempted power grab.
Throughout the proceedings, Yoon consistently denied wrongdoing, arguing that his actions were intended to protect freedom and counter what he described as a “legislative dictatorship.” Prosecutors, however, characterized his conduct as a lust for power and an attempt to establish a long-term authoritarian rule. The court emphasized that his martial law declaration inflicted severe social costs and reaffirmed the life sentence. Yoon has the right to appeal the verdict.
The former president’s tenure had been marked by controversy, including his handling of a deadly 2022 Halloween crowd crush, allegations of corruption involving his wife Kim Keon Hee, and criticism for economic mismanagement. Yoon’s political rise had initially gained him recognition for his anti-corruption efforts and his role in the 2016 impeachment of Park Geun-hye. However, his failed attempt to seize power in 2024 has drawn historical parallels to military coups in South Korea between 1960 and 1980, rekindling memories of political instability.
Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, was earlier sentenced to 20 months in prison in January 2026 for unrelated bribery charges, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of the former presidential household. Outside the courthouse, thousands of Yoon supporters protested, calling for the charges to be dropped, while the court emphasized that the legal process must proceed regardless of public pressure.

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
Lukoil’s Burgas refinery has reported significant cost savings following the removal of its Switzerland-based intermediary, Litasco. Speaking to the parliamentary Committee on Economic Policy and Innovation, Rumen Spetsov, Lukoil’s Special Commercial Administrator, confirmed that the refinery now operates fully on market principles, with 86% of its production capacity currently in use.
Spetsov emphasized that halting Russian oil imports has not led to higher fuel prices from the Burgas plant. He explained that the elimination of the intermediary has improved the company’s ability to negotiate both crude oil purchases and fuel sales. “In the two months since Litasco was removed, the refinery has saved eight million dollars,” Spetsov stated.
In addition, Spetsov highlighted that all refinery operations are under close scrutiny by the United States, with every transaction being carefully monitored. He dismissed concerns that Russian oil might be entering the facility in violation of sanctions, reaffirming that Lukoil’s Burgas operations fully comply with international regulations.
The move marks a notable shift in the refinery’s commercial approach, streamlining its operations and reinforcing transparency in the post-sanctions environment, while maintaining stable fuel pricing for the Bulgarian market.
Outgoing Bulgarian Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov described the extension of the general license for Lukoil subsidiaries in Bulgaria until August 13 as more than a bureaucratic formality, calling it a key measure of economic stability for the country.
The United Kingdom has decided to extend the validity of the general license covering Lukoil’s subsidiaries operating in Bulgaria, the Ministry of Energy announced.

Tensions Escalate: Trump Prepares US Forces for Potential Iran Operation

21:00:00 KST

The United States has significantly increased its military presence in the Middle East, deploying warships, fighter jets, and aerial refueling aircraft in what could form the foundation for a sustained campaign against Iran, should President Donald Trump authorize action. Trump, who previously ordered strikes on Iran, has repeatedly threatened further military measures if ongoing nuclear negotiations fail to produce a replacement for the 2018 deal he abandoned.
According to reports from CNN and CBS, US forces could be ready to launch strikes as early as this weekend, although Trump has not yet made a final decision. Senior adviser Susan Ziadeh of the Center for Strategic and International Studies noted that the sheer volume of deployed firepower in the region creates its own momentum, making it increasingly difficult to reverse course.
Naval Presence
Currently, Washington maintains 13 warships in the Middle East, including the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, nine destroyers, and three littoral combat ships, with additional vessels on the way. The USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, is traveling from the Caribbean to the region, escorted by three destroyers. The presence of two carriers in the area simultaneously is rare and reflects the scale of the US military buildup. Last year, two carriers were in the Middle East during Israel’s 12-day campaign targeting Iranian nuclear sites.
Air Assets
The United States has also sent a fleet of aircraft to the region, including F-22 Raptors, F-15s, F-16s, and KC-135 refueling planes. Recent flight-tracking data shows multiple KC-135 tankers, E-3 Sentry airborne warning planes, and cargo aircraft operating in or near the Middle East, supporting potential combat operations.
Context of Protests and Threats
The deployment followed Iran’s crackdown on mass protests that began over economic grievances but evolved into broader anti-government demonstrations. Trump had threatened military intervention in response to potential violence against protesters and encouraged Iranians to seize state institutions. While he postponed strikes last month after Iran reportedly halted executions under US pressure, threats have resumed.
Diplomatic channels remain active. Indirect talks in Geneva between US and Iranian officials aimed at preventing escalation have produced only “guiding principles,” with major differences still unresolved, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. She emphasized that while there is some progress, the US is prepared for military action if necessary, urging Iran to make a deal.
Iran’s Position
Iranian officials insist its nuclear program is peaceful, with uranium enrichment essential for energy production. Mohammad Eslami, head of Iran’s atomic energy agency, stressed that no country can deny Iran the right to enrich nuclear fuel, while reaffirming compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency rules. Israel, the US, and Europe remain skeptical of Tehran’s assurances.
Potential Scale and Regional Coordination
US outlets report that operations against Iran could begin imminently, with a possible campaign lasting weeks. CBS noted that the USS Abraham Lincoln, with nearly 80 aircraft, is positioned about 700 kilometers off Iranian shores, while the USS Gerald Ford is en route. The Pentagon has reportedly relocated some personnel to Europe or the US as a precaution. Israel is expected to participate alongside US forces.
US Assets in Bulgaria
Amid the buildup, seven US Air Force tanker aircraft and three transport planes, including C-17s and C-130s, were observed at Sofia Airport’s Terminal 1, along with several Boeing 747s. Security analyst Milen Keremedchiev noted that these assets are likely transiting to the Middle East and signal an imminent escalation.
International Reactions
Russia has warned that strikes on Iran would be extremely dangerous, potentially involving nuclear risks. Iran has stated it seeks no war but will defend its stated red lines while remaining open to diplomacy. Washington has made clear that preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons remains a top priority, though Tehran maintains its program is civilian and has expressed readiness to limit activities if sanctions are lifted.
Additional Developments
In parallel, Trump criticized the UK government’s plan to transfer control of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, citing the strategic importance of Diego Garcia for potential operations against Iran. While the US approved the deal, Trump publicly warned Prime Minister Keir Starmer against proceeding, drawing criticism from UK opposition figures and prompting debate over the base’s long-term use.

Following the swearing-in of the caretaker cabinet, Prime Minister Andrey Gyurov addressed the National Assembly, emphasizing a government guided by reason rather than hysteria. He made it clear that his administration would not promise immediate reforms or miracles, but would focus on ensuring fair elections and maintaining stability. Gyurov outlined seven central tasks his cabinet would prioritize during its mandate.
Further reading: Oath Taken: New Caretaker Cabinet Takes Over in Bulgaria, Focus on Elections, Budget Stability and Rule of Law
The first priority is securing financial stability through the management of a long-term budget, implementing measures linked to Bulgaria’s euro adoption plan, and preparing both the upcoming long-term and the 2026 regular budget. Second, funds will be allocated fairly across municipalities, ensuring resources reach citizens rather than being diverted for political campaigns. Third, the government aims to maintain the regularity of pension payments, social benefits, and assistance to vulnerable groups, including the unemployed and socially disadvantaged.
Further reading: New PM Gyurov: “No Revanchism, Only Fair Elections and Accountability”
Gyurov highlighted the importance of restoring legality within the prosecutor’s office and ensuring the proper functioning of justice through specific mandates for the Supreme Judicial Council. Fifth, the government will set clear standards for judicial nominations proposed by the Minister of Justice, strengthening transparency in key appointments. Sixth, citizen security will be guaranteed through strict adherence to legal norms, transparent communication from institutions, and a commitment to prevent secrecy or misinformation. Finally, the caretaker government will focus on organizing elections abroad in coordination with the Central Election Commission and Bulgarian communities, pledging personally to oversee a fair process.
Further reading: Bulgaria: Who's Who in Andrey Gyurov's Caretaker Cabinet
The Prime Minister addressed the public directly, acknowledging Bulgaria’s current internal tensions and global uncertainties. He stressed that democracy is a practical response to crises, and that elections remain the legitimate mechanism for citizens to shape a representative parliament. Gyurov reinforced Bulgaria’s Euro-Atlantic commitment as a matter of strategy and security, and pledged support for lasting peace in Ukraine and beyond, emphasizing cooperation with the European Union, NATO, and the UN.
Gyurov reflected on the widespread public protests demanding democracy and responsible governance, asserting that fair elections require civic maturity and active participation, along with strict adherence to the law. He called on citizens to vote on April 19 and ensure their ballots are respected. The caretaker government, he emphasized, will remain impartial, without party affiliations, and will seek cooperation from all parliamentary groups to enact necessary legislative measures.
Further reading: Will Radev and the Liberals Join Forces? What the Caretaker PM Choice Really Means for Bulgaria
The Prime Minister underlined the importance of compliance with the Recovery and Resilience Plan, describing its funds as a matter of trust rather than aid. He reaffirmed that the government operates without hidden agreements or coalition mathematics, committing to governance marked by integrity, responsibility, and transparency. Gyurov highlighted the broad expert composition of the cabinet, combining political experience with independence from party structures, aiming to demonstrate that responsible management can achieve tangible results.
In practical terms, the caretaker cabinet will begin work immediately. Acting Finance Minister Georgi Klisurski outlined three financial priorities: securing funds for the upcoming elections, extending the current Budget Law to maintain state operations beyond March 31, and unblocking delayed municipal payments under the National Investment Program, totaling 460 million euros. Klisurski also commended former Finance Minister Temenuzhka Petkova for successfully introducing the euro, noting its smooth circulation over the past two months.
Earlier on the same day, the formal transfer of power took place at the Council of Ministers, where Rosen Zhelyazkov handed over authority to Andrey Gyurov. Following the ceremony, ministers returned to their respective departments to continue administrative transitions and ensure a smooth handover. The caretaker government will govern until a regular cabinet is formed, focusing on elections, transparency, and the responsible management of public resources.

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Prince Andrew, has been taken into custody in connection with an investigation into alleged misconduct in public office. The arrest comes as police examine his activities as a UK trade envoy, including alleged sharing of sensitive information with convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Thames Valley Police confirmed that a man in his sixties from Norfolk was arrested on 19 February and remains in custody. Searches are ongoing at properties in Berkshire and Norfolk. The police have not publicly named Mountbatten-Windsor in line with national guidance, citing the active nature of the investigation and the need to avoid contempt of court.
Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright stated that the investigation followed a thorough assessment and emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity and objectivity of police work. He acknowledged the significant public interest and said updates would be provided as appropriate.
The arrest coincided with Mountbatten-Windsor celebrating his 66th birthday at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate. Photographs published online showed unmarked police vehicles and plainclothes officers at his residence, conducting searches and gathering evidence.
The anti-monarchy group Republic welcomed the arrest, claiming it was influenced by their pursuit of a private prosecution after previous police reluctance to investigate. Republic CEO Graham Smith highlighted that the group had submitted a crime report, and said their lawyers would continue to provide information on related alleged offences. Smith called on senior royals Charles and William to clarify what they knew about the allegations.
Historically, no senior British royal has been arrested in modern times. The last instance dates back to King Charles I, who was detained in 1647 during the English Civil War and later executed for high treason. Mountbatten-Windsor’s sister, Princess Anne, was fined under the Dangerous Dogs Act in 2002 but was not arrested.
The arrest follows the release of emails by the US Department of Justice suggesting that Mountbatten-Windsor forwarded confidential reports on official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Singapore, and shared investment briefings related to Afghanistan with Epstein in 2010. These emails form part of the ongoing police assessment.
Mountbatten-Windsor is now the first senior royal in recent history to face arrest. Thames Valley Police continue to investigate the alleged misconduct, while emphasizing adherence to legal procedures and the proper handling of evidence throughout the inquiry.

Lukoil Burgas Cuts 8 Million in Costs After Dropping Swiss Intermediary
Lukoil’s Burgas refinery has reported significant cost savings following the removal of its Switzerland-based intermediary, Litasco
Wizz Air, the leading airline in Bulgaria by market share, has announced the launch of a new direct route connecting Burgas with Radom, Poland. Flights on this line will operate twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Saturdays, beginning on July 21, 2026, at the peak of the summer travel season. Tickets are now available through wizzair.com and the airline’s mobile app, starting from €24.99* per one-way journey.
Radom, located in Poland’s Mazovia region, is increasingly recognized as a destination for short breaks and cultural tourism. The city offers visitors a blend of historical architecture and modern urban life, including its central square and the Cathedral of St. Virgin. With a vibrant calendar of festivals and cultural events, Radom also provides easy access to Warsaw, making it an appealing entry point for exploring Central Poland.
The new Burgas–Radom connection opens opportunities for Bulgarian travelers to reach a lesser-known but growing tourist region in Poland. Wizz Air’s strategy focuses on offering alternative destinations that combine cultural appeal with affordability, expanding its network beyond major capitals and enhancing travel options for both short city trips and longer holidays.
In addition to this new route, Wizz Air maintains strong operations from Burgas, linking the Bulgarian Black Sea coast with several major European cities, including London Luton, Budapest, and key Polish destinations such as Warsaw, Katowice, Gdansk, and Lublin. The expansion not only strengthens outbound travel but also promotes inbound tourism to Bulgaria’s southern Black Sea region, further reinforcing the airline’s long-term investment in the local market and regional connectivity.
Salvatore Gabriele Imperiale, Wizz Air’s Corporate Communications Manager, highlighted the importance of the route: “Launching direct flights from Burgas to Radom supports our strategy to stimulate holiday travel and connect Bulgaria with new European destinations. Bulgaria and Poland are key markets for both inbound and outbound tourism, and this new connection will boost interest in the Black Sea coast for the summer season. We are pleased to offer passengers affordable fares and convenient travel, while contributing to the growth of maritime tourism in Bulgaria.”
Currently, Wizz Air operates 65 routes from Bulgaria to 18 countries, with a fleet of ten aircraft based locally. Since beginning operations in 2005, the airline has transported more than 33.2 million passengers to and from Bulgaria, reflecting its commitment to the Bulgarian market. In 2025, Wizz Air flew over 15,000 flights within the country, carrying more than 3.1 million passengers. Operational performance has improved significantly, with on-time accuracy rising by 8.5% year-on-year and a flight performance rate of 99.6%. For the current winter season, the airline is offering over 1.6 million seats in Bulgaria, marking a 42.6% increase compared to the previous year and reaffirming its leadership in affordable air travel and connectivity.
*The one-way fare includes the administrative fee and a small cabin bag (40x30x20 cm). Checked luggage and larger cabin items incur additional charges. Prices are valid for bookings via wizzair.com and the WIZZ app only and are subject to limited availability.
Bulgarian tourism experienced a strong rebound in 2025, with notable increases in visitor numbers, overnight stays, and tourism revenues, according to outgoing Minister of Tourism Miroslav Borshosh.
Revenue from overnight stays in Bulgaria continued to rise at a solid pace at the end of 2025, with hotel income in December increasing by 12.5 percent on an annual basis
Bulgaria saw a record influx of Romanian tourists in 2025, according to the latest figures from the National Statistical Institute
The fully renovated underground parking facility at Terminal 2 of Vasil Levski Airport in Sofia has officially opened, offering parking for over 900 vehicles.
Foreign travel activity picked up noticeably toward the end of 2025, with both outbound trips by Bulgarians and inbound visits by foreigners posting their strongest growth in months, according to data from the National Statistical Institute.
Tourism can play a central role in boosting Bulgaria’s overall economic development, but this requires a clearly defined long-term strategy, particularly when it comes to cooperation with neighboring countries.

Delyan Peevski, leader of the DPS-New Beginning parliamentary group, issued a strongly worded statement in response to the swearing-in of the “Gyurov” caretaker government before the National Assembly. Peevski said his group did not honor the oath of the new cabinet, arguing that it “does not represent servants of the people” and labeling the process as “hypocrisy and substitution.” He criticized the government for failing to address what he described as the most serious threats to Bulgaria’s children.

In his statement, Peevski referred to the caretaker cabinet as the “Yotova-Soros-Petrohan” government and pledged that his party will actively oppose it. He framed the appointment as part of a broader threat, pointing to “atypical” schools and universities, NGOs, media outlets, and surrogate parties, which he linked to what he called the “Soros sect” and Sorosoidism. According to Peevski, these forces endanger morality, democracy, and national values, and have allowed pedophiles to harm children, referencing the Petrohan case as one example.

The DPS-New Beginning leader emphasized that his party will not stand by as the state undergoes what he described as a “disintegration of statehood.” He stated that the party will employ all parliamentary tools to defend Bulgaria’s democracy, morality, and the integrity of families. Peevski also criticized President Iliana Yotova for selecting the caretaker cabinet, describing her decision as “the big compromise” due to an uncertain political future, and holding her fully accountable for it.
Concluding his statement, Peevski reiterated that the protection of citizens, families, and children is non-negotiable for the DPS, asserting that the party will resist any pressure, manipulation, or influence from networks he characterized as “Sorosoid, pedophile, and perverted.” He framed this stance as a matter of principle and national responsibility.

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
Deputy Chairwoman of the GERB parliamentary group, Denitsa Sacheva, voiced strong criticism of the new caretaker government immediately after its swearing-in, calling the appointment of the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for fair elections a “false start.” Speaking to journalists in the National Assembly, she questioned the choice of Stoil Tsitselkov, noting that his background does not inspire confidence in the government’s ability to ensure a transparent and impartial electoral process.

Sacheva acknowledged that President Iliana Yotova had a limited selection for nominating a caretaker prime minister and that during consultations, GERB had proposed alternatives that could have broadened her options. Nevertheless, the party disagrees with the notion that the president bears no responsibility for the cabinet’s composition. She emphasized that Yotova had the opportunity to influence the selection of government members, even if the prime minister’s nomination was constrained.

On the caretaker government’s role, Sacheva criticized what she described as a “moral narrative” from Prime Minister Andrey Gyurov, arguing that the cabinet should focus solely on ensuring state functions run smoothly and on organizing fair elections, rather than pursuing broad political reforms. She stressed that a caretaker government must remain equidistant from all parties and avoid setting political agendas beyond its mandate.
Further reading: New PM Gyurov: “No Revanchism, Only Fair Elections and Accountability”
Concerns about the Deputy Prime Minister for fair elections were heightened by questions raised in parliament about Tsitselkov’s past, including allegations of arrests for drug possession and drunk driving in 2010, 2011, and 2014, highlighted by TISP chairman Toshko Yordanov. Sacheva criticized the double standards in moral expectations, arguing that those in charge of election fairness must meet the highest standards themselves.
Political analysts offered mixed assessments of the caretaker cabinet. Teodor Slavev described it as a limited institution whose main purpose is to restore trust in the electoral process, warning that parties may use it as a “punching bag” during the campaign. Alexander Simov referred to its formation as an “occult ritual” aiming to revive the WCC-DB coalition, while Hristo Panchugov echoed that the cabinet lacks substantial powers, focusing mainly on ensuring transparent elections.

Other experts, however, viewed the cabinet more positively. Political scientists Stoycho Stoychev and Georgi Prodanov highlighted the wide spectrum of members included, ranging from older to younger figures and from various political backgrounds, calling it a “pleasant surprise” and an effort to demonstrate inclusivity. Kancho Stoychev noted that right-wing parties remain underrepresented and that systemic judicial issues, such as the replacement of the Prosecutor General, remain unresolved, emphasizing that the priority should be trust in the electoral process rather than specific personnel choices.

The transition of power in Bulgaria was marked by a formal ceremony in the Granite Hall of the Council of Ministers, where former Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov handed over authority to Acting Prime Minister Andrey Gyurov. Zhelyazkov described the moment as one of responsibility both accepted and transferred, emphasizing that in a political career, two dates stand out: the day a leader assumes office, filled with commitments and expectations, and the day they leave, a moment of reckoning where lessons are learned. He noted that history rarely remembers titles or positions, but always records the decisions made when necessary.
During his farewell, Zhelyazkov thanked his colleagues for facing difficult choices and not taking the easy path. Addressing Gyurov, he expressed confidence in the new prime minister’s ability to distinguish successes from failures, build upon achievements, and correct errors. He framed the handover as a continuation of governance, describing it as a “torch” that can illuminate the future while leaving the past behind.
Gyurov, in turn, highlighted the role of democratic instincts in society, noting that citizens exercise their voice to change power without causing destruction. He pledged that the caretaker government would not operate on revanchist principles but would act according to established rules. For him, the priority is to regain public trust through transparency in decision-making and accountability for every euro spent.
“The goal is national unity, not through consensus of opinion, but through adherence to rules,” Gyurov said. He stressed the importance of fair elections as the foundation for achieving this objective. Citizens, he noted, have demonstrated their concerns through protests, seeking security for their families, opportunities for their children, and a fair environment for business. The caretaker government’s mission is to address these expectations without delay.
The ceremony followed the swearing-in of the Gyurov Cabinet in the National Assembly. From the parliamentary rostrum, Gyurov reaffirmed that the government will manage the country until a regular cabinet is formed, “without hysteria, grounded in reason and reality.” He emphasized that the caretaker administration aims for honest governance, starting with the assurance of a transparent and fair electoral process.
President Iliana Yotova, present at the transition, underscored that she would closely monitor the implementation of Gyurov’s seven-point agenda, ensuring the caretaker government adheres to its commitments.
Zhelyazkov reiterated his advice to the new leadership, reminding them of the dual responsibility inherent in political office: to act decisively when taking charge and to leave a legacy of effective decisions upon departure. Gyurov echoed these sentiments, describing the moment as a “returning” to democratic values and a reaffirmation of societal preservation through civic participation.
He stressed that the government’s work would not focus on political retribution but on achieving key objectives. Restoring public confidence requires transparency in all expenditures and strict accountability. Equally important is securing national unity through fair and predictable rules, anchored by a credible electoral process.
Gyurov concluded by highlighting immediate priorities: ensuring security for citizens, supporting families, and maintaining fair competition in the economy. With the caretaker cabinet officially in place, Bulgaria enters a period of interim governance centered on rule-based management, transparency, and preparation for the upcoming elections.

GERB is set to hold a reporting and election national assembly on March 22 in Sofia, marking the start of the campaign for the early parliamentary elections scheduled for April 19. The party announced the upcoming congress in newspapers on Friday, highlighting that the agenda will focus on electing new leadership bodies, including the chairman. While the election of the chairman is largely formal and Boyko Borissov is expected to retain his post, changes are anticipated within both the Executive Committee and among the party’s deputy chairmen.
Further reading: Caretaker Government Appointed in Bulgaria, Early Elections Set for April 19
Currently, the deputy chairmen are Tomislav Donchev and Daniel Mitov. The Executive Committee also includes Zhivko Todorov, Todor Todorov, Tsveta Karayancheva, Yordanka Fandakova, Dimitar Nikolov, Denitsa Sacheva, Ivan Totev, Ilter Beizatov, Kostadin Angelov, Todor Krastev, and Delyan Dobrev. Recent media reports suggested that Dobrev might leave politics and GERB, citing alleged tensions with Borisov. However, Dobrev later confirmed he would remain in the party, dismissing the speculation as exaggerated.
Under the party statute, national assemblies are convened at least once every four years by the decision of the Executive Committee. The previous assembly was held on November 8, 2024. Delegates to the assembly are elected from municipal organizations according to procedures and quotas set by the Executive Committee. Participants include municipal leaders, regional coordinators, regional managers, members of parliament, ministers, governors, mayors, chairmen of municipal councils, members of the Executive Committee and Control Committee, as well as Members of the European Parliament elected on GERB’s list.
The National Assembly holds the authority to adopt, amend, or supplement the party statute, determine party policy, elect the chairman, deputy chairmen, and remaining members of the Executive and Control Committees, and dismiss members of these bodies, including ex-officio members. Decisions at the assembly are made by a simple majority, ensuring that party leadership and internal structures are formally reviewed and renewed ahead of the election campaign.

US Planes Spotted in Bulgaria as Tensions With Iran Intensify (UPDATED)

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
A notable presence of US military aircraft has been observed at Terminal 1 of Sofia Airport in Bulgaria, according to former Deputy Foreign Minister and security analyst Milen Keremedchiev. In a post on Facebook, he reported that seven US Air Force tanker aircraft, used for aerial refueling of combat jets, are currently stationed at the airport.
His remarks come amid growing international reporting that Washington is preparing for possible military action against Iran. According to CNN, US forces are operationally ready, although President Donald Trump has not yet taken a final decision on whether to authorize strikes. Other US media outlets have described the current military buildup in the Middle East as the largest since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Update: The Ministry of Defense confirmed that US Air Force aircraft are currently stationed at Sofia’s Vasil Levski Airport, following media reports. The deployment is part of training exercises linked to NATO’s enhanced vigilance operations. The ministry noted that accompanying personnel are present to maintain and service the aircraft.
“The Republic of Bulgaria supports the pre-deployment of United States aircraft and airfield support equipment for the purpose of conducting training related to the implementation of Enhanced Vigilance Activities (eVA) activities in accordance with the Access, Basing and Overflight Agreements.” This is stated in a position statement of the US Embassy in Bulgaria for bTV. The new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nadezhda Neynski, told journalists that she had requested information regarding the US aircraft in Bulgaria and would inform them when she learned something.
The New York Post, citing former Pentagon official and Atlantic Council fellow Alex Plitzas, reported that the scale of the deployment suggests preparations for a potentially prolonged air campaign. The Wall Street Journal similarly noted that hundreds of fighter, support and refueling aircraft have already been positioned in and around the region, with a second US aircraft carrier also en route.
Israeli daily Haaretz quoted a senior US military official as saying that a strike could come as early as this weekend, though early next week was described as more likely. The same report said that the Pentagon plans to relocate part of its personnel from the Middle East to Europe or back to the United States within days, as a precaution against possible Iranian retaliation. Despite these preparations, US officials stress that a final political decision has not yet been made.
At the same time, diplomatic channels remain open. Indirect talks between the United States and Iran have taken place in Geneva, focusing on Tehran’s nuclear program, but have so far failed to produce tangible progress. A senior Iranian official said the negotiations hinge on Washington avoiding what Tehran views as unrealistic demands.
Moscow has reacted sharply to the possibility of US strikes. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that military action would amount to “playing with fire” and could lead to extremely dangerous consequences, including the risk of a nuclear incident. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, for his part, said Iran does not seek war but will not cross its stated red lines under pressure, while continuing to express readiness for a diplomatic solution.
Washington maintains that it is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons “by one means or another.” Tehran has repeatedly denied pursuing nuclear arms, insisting its program is civilian in nature, and has signaled willingness to limit nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions.
Bulgaria has announced its intention to acquire more than 100 Centauros anti-drone systems from Greece in multiple configurations, under the framework of the European SAFE regulation
Bulgaria has taken another step toward upgrading its armed forces, as the government has launched the execution of a key modernization initiative for the Bulgarian Army. The development was confirmed by the press center of the Ministry of Defense.
Bulgarian drone developer Dronamics has unveiled a new defense platform built around its cargo drone, the Black Swan, aiming to fill a major gap in European airspace security.
A recent Eurobarometer survey indicates that Bulgarians show relatively low confidence in the European Union’s ability to strengthen security and defense
Bulgaria is set to receive €490 million through the EU’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) instrument
Outgoing Bulgarian Defence Minister Atanas Zapryanov confirmed that the Bulgarian Army is in the process of transitioning to NATO-standard weapons, a step aimed at modernizing its arsenal.

The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
The caretaker government headed by Andrey Gyurov officially entered office after taking the oath before the National Assembly in the presence of President Iliana Yotova. Gyurov and the ministers pledged to observe the Constitution and the law, declaring that all their actions would be guided by the public interest.
Further reading: Caretaker Government Appointed in Bulgaria, Early Elections Set for April 19
Addressing the plenary hall in his first speech as caretaker prime minister, Gyurov said the cabinet assumes full responsibility for organizing and conducting fair parliamentary elections. He stressed that the task goes beyond administration and requires trust, civic engagement and institutional integrity. Speaking against the backdrop of internal political tension, he said the government would lead the country until a regular cabinet is formed, without emotional rhetoric or unrealistic promises, but with restraint, professionalism and a clear sense of responsibility.
Gyurov underlined that the caretaker cabinet would not pursue political advantage and would act impartially. He reaffirmed Bulgaria’s commitment to its European and Euro-Atlantic orientation, describing it as a strategic value and a guarantee of security and prosperity rather than a tactical choice. The government, he said, would continue cooperation with partners in the EU, NATO and the UN, and would support international efforts for a lasting and just peace in Ukraine within the framework of international law.
Calling on citizens to take part in the April 19 vote, Gyurov urged Bulgarians not to surrender their right to choose or allow their ballots to be used for private interests. Elections, he said, are the only legitimate way out of the political crisis and the only mechanism capable of restoring confidence in institutions.
Beyond election organization, the caretaker prime minister outlined a set of priority tasks. These include maintaining financial stability through a long-term budget framework, implementing measures related to euro adoption, and preparing the foundations for the 2026 state budget. He also highlighted the need for fair and transparent allocation of funds to municipalities, regular payment of pensions and social benefits, restoration of legality in the prosecution system, normal functioning of the judiciary, guarantees for national security, and improved transparency in institutional communication. Special attention will also be paid to organizing voting abroad in coordination with the Central Election Commission and Bulgarian communities.
Gyurov insisted that there are no hidden political arrangements behind the caretaker cabinet and no “coalition mathematics”. The government, he said, will not act with revanchism but with clear rules, accountability and calm governance. According to him, success will be measured by higher voter turnout and public recognition of the elections as fair.
Following the oath-taking, an official handover ceremony took place at the Council of Ministers, where former prime minister Rosen Zhelyazkov transferred power to Gyurov. Zhelyazkov described the moment as one of responsibility and continuity, thanking his outgoing ministers and ministry staff, and expressing confidence that his successor would build on achievements while correcting mistakes. Gyurov responded that democracy allows citizens to change power through the ballot box and that restoring trust requires transparency, unity and economic stability.
As part of the transition, ministers assumed control of their respective portfolios. Defense Minister Atanas Zapryanov retained his position. New roles were introduced, including a Deputy Prime Minister for Fair Elections, while responsibilities for European funds were restructured. The reshuffle marked a full shift from the regular government to the caretaker administration.
Some parliamentary groups boycotted the oath ceremony, while others left the chamber during Gyurov’s address. Political reactions followed immediately. President Yotova said she would closely monitor the implementation of the government’s announced priorities, emphasizing transparency and depoliticization. She noted that while she approved the cabinet proposed by Gyurov, responsibility for ministerial choices lies with him, adding that she has reservations about some appointments and would not hesitate to voice concerns if they prove justified.
Opposition voices were sharply divided. Delyan Peevski announced that his parliamentary group did not attend the ceremony, accusing the cabinet of hypocrisy and political dependence, and pledging strong parliamentary resistance. MECH leader Radostin Vassilev questioned the neutrality of several ministers and criticized President Yotova for approving the cabinet while distancing herself from responsibility, calling for the withdrawal of specific nominations.
From WCC-DB, MP and former justice minister Nadezhda Yordanova said her formation would judge the caretaker government strictly by its actions, particularly in sensitive cases involving the judiciary. She stressed the need for full investigations, legal accountability and reforms guaranteeing professionalism and political neutrality in judicial institutions.

Search Resumes for Three Fishermen Missing near Bulgaria’s Southern Coast

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
The search for the fishing vessel with three people on board, which vanished east of cape Maslen Nos, is resuming this morning with an expanded effort. Alongside the official teams, eight groups of volunteers are joining the operation, patrolling the coastline between Sozopol and Primorsko. A drone will also be deployed to scan hard-to-reach areas.
Among the volunteers is one of the captain’s sons. He said the family is clinging to the hope that his father and his 25-year-old brother managed to survive and are waiting in a life raft.
The vessel left port yesterday to fish for turbot, despite difficult conditions at sea. At the time, winds were reaching around 20 metres per second and the sea was heavily agitated. When the boat’s signal disappeared from radar systems, a large-scale search was launched involving rescue services, the Border Police and the military. The operation was halted late in the evening because of darkness.
Mariners say the circumstances of the disappearance are particularly alarming. Sailor Zdravko Vassilev explained on television that there is a discrepancy of two to three minutes between the data from the AIS tracking system and the coastal radars. According to him, such an abrupt loss of signal is highly unusual, but there is still hope that, if an incident occurred, the crew had just enough time to deploy a life raft.
Vassilev clarified that the coastal radars are monitored by the Border Police, while the AIS system continuously transmits a vessel’s position in real time. He stressed that the strong winds could have pushed the crew far out to sea and appealed for an aerial search to be carried out. He also called on the Maritime Administration to issue an alert for missing persons as quickly as possible.
As daylight returns, both volunteers and authorities continue to comb the area, hoping for any sign of the missing fishermen.
Teams of volunteers searching for the missing fishing vessel near Sozopol have discovered an oil spill in the sea at the point where the ship’s signal was last detected.
A rescue operation is ongoing to locate a Bulgarian fishing vessel that vanished from radar early Wednesday in the Black Sea near Sozopol.
A tragic accident claimed the life of a 5-year-old girl near Vidin, according to the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Danube city.
A bus carrying 25 passengers on a route to Bucharest became stranded near the Bulgarian village of Vardim, close to Svishtov, amid difficult winter conditions in the Veliko Tarnovo region.
A tragic incident has once again drawn attention in Haskovo. On 14 February 2026, a 16-year-old student from the Atanas Burov Finance and Economics High School took his own life at his home
A tragic discovery was made in Sofia after the body of a newborn baby, placed inside a plastic bag, was found close to a playground in the Druzhba-1 residential area, the Sofia Police Directorate confirmed.

'Do not give away Diego Garcia': Trump attacks the UK over Chagos Islands deal, again
Unknown

17:23:36 KST

U.S. President Donald Trump has once again criticized the U.K.'s plan to hand the Chagos Islands back to Mauritius, telling the country not to "give away" the territory where a strategic U.S.-U.K. military base is located.
"DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!" Trump posted on his Truth Social media platform on Wednesday, saying he'd been telling British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that he should "not lose control, for any reason, of Diego Garcia."
The U.K. agreed in May 2025 to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which has long-disputed the U.K.'s acquisition and ownership of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean.
The deal would see the U.K. lease back the military base it shares with the U.S. on the largest island on the archipelago, Diego Garcia, for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year, for an initial 99-year period.
The U.S. previously voiced support for the deal and, on Tuesday, the Department of State said it "supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago."
Trump seesaws on the deal
Trump is not the biggest fan of the Chagos deal, however, and he has seesawed on the issue of ceding the territory to Mauritius.
In January, he called the deal "an act of great stupidity," but he was more conciliatory in early February, stating: "I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make," he commented on Truth Social.
"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia," he added.
On Wednesday, he returned to his negative position on the agreement, saying that he'd told Starmer "that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries."
"He is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease with whoever it is that is 'claiming' Right, Title, and Interest to Diego Garcia, strategically located in the Indian Ocean," Trump said.
The president suggested that giving the islands away was an act of "Wokeism," as it had come after the U.K. faced sustained international and legal pressure to relinquish the islands, and to redress its thorny colonial history on the islands.
"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them," Trump said.
The U.K. has repeatedly said that it "will never compromise on our national security" when it comes to the Chagos deal.
Iran action?
Trump also suggested Wednesday that the joint military base on the island could be vital if military action was taken against Iran — if the Islamic Republic did not agree a new nuclear deal during current talks with the U.S.
"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia, and the Airfield located in Fairford, in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime — An attack that would potentially be made on the United Kingdom, as well as other friendly Countries," Trump said.
The U.S. and Mauritius are due to hold talks on the Chagos deal next week, from Feb. 23-25, with the U.S. Department of State noting that the discussions" underscore the continued importance of the Chagos archipelago and the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia to our national security."
"The discussions will focus on bilateral security cooperation and effective implementation of security arrangements for the base to ensure its long-term, secure operation," the department said.

The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
Vice President Iliana Yotova has formalized the appointment of a caretaker government headed by Andrey Gyurov, the presidency announced on Thursday.
With a separate decree, Yotova also set the date for early parliamentary elections, which will take place on April 19, 2026. A further decree determines the numbering, names, and territorial boundaries of the electoral districts for the vote.

The move follows Gyurov’s presentation of the proposed caretaker cabinet to Yotova on Wednesday. After reviewing the lineup, the head of state approved the nominees and confirmed that the interim government would be appointed.

Before formally assuming office, Gyurov is required to resign from his position as deputy governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, a step that must be approved by the National Assembly. Later on Thursday, Gyurov and the caretaker ministers are expected to take the oath before parliament. This will be followed by a formal handover of power at the Council of Ministers.
The composition of the caretaker cabinet combines figures who have served in previous interim and regular governments with professionals entering politics for the first time. Its announcement has prompted divided reactions across the political spectrum.
Representatives of WCC-DB, Gyurov’s former political partners, described the nominees as experienced individuals rather than prominent political personalities. Former president Rumen Radev, who stepped down in January to run in the elections, characterized the cabinet members as party and political figures.

From the opposition, GERB and DPS-New Beginning said the caretaker government was Yotova’s personal responsibility. GERB suggested links to Radev, while DPS argued that the cabinet was connected to WCC-DB.
The appointment comes more than two months after the resignation of the previous government, formed by GERB, BSP and TISP, with parliamentary backing from DPS-New Beginning. That cabinet stepped down in December amid the largest nationwide protests Bulgaria has seen in decades.
Under the constitution, Yotova, who is completing the presidential term following Radev’s resignation, could choose a caretaker prime minister from a list of ten senior officeholders. Gyurov was among five who indicated readiness to accept the role. The others included Deputy Ombudswoman Maria Filipova, Chairman of the Chamber of Accounts Dimitar Glavchev, and his deputies Silvia Kadreva and Margarita Nikolova.
Yotova is expected to attend the swearing in of the caretaker cabinet in the National Assembly. Immediately afterward, a formal ceremony will mark the transfer of authority from the outgoing government of Rosen Zhelyazkov to the interim administration led by Gyurov.

Bulgaria Makes Pedophilia Registry Partially Public to Protect Children
The National Assembly has approved amendments to the Child Protection Act that make part of the National Register for Cases of Pedophilia accessible to the public.
Lyubomir Datsov, a member of Bulgaria’s Fiscal Council, has warned that the country faces a growing problem due to the lack of an anti-inflationary policy, despite the current inflation not being overly high. He made the remarks on NOVA NEWS, noting that while some inflation is normal as the economy adapts to changing circumstances, ignoring measures to curb it is a real concern.
Datsov emphasized that citizens can distinguish between politicians offering empty populist promises and those who understand the necessary economic steps. “When someone talks about an anti-inflationary policy, you know they are serious. But if they speak about controlling prices, be prepared to pay the price yourself,” he said.
He also outlined four key areas the caretaker government must address to prepare the next regular administration for an effective start. These include a horizontal administrative reform, a pension insurance reform emphasizing the second pillar as central to the system’s future, and reassessments in healthcare and education to improve their existing models.
On wage increases, Datsov noted that the previously approved 5% raise cannot be implemented under current legislation. “There is no money to cover this increase with the current legal framework,” he added, highlighting the limitations faced by the government in fulfilling such commitments.

Albania, Italy, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, and Romania have formally recognized Corridor 8 as a strategic axis for South-Eastern Europe, emphasizing its political, economic, and security significance, BGNES reported. The five countries signed a joint declaration in Tirana, affirming their commitment to develop the corridor into a functional artery of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T), with a direct role in supporting the gradual integration of the Western Balkans into the European Union. Bulgaria was represented at the event by Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay Pavlov.
The declaration underlines that Corridor 8, linking the Adriatic and Black Seas, holds triple importance - political, economic, and security - and serves as a key driver of regional cohesion and European integration. Coordinated implementation is expected to address historical connectivity gaps in South-Eastern Europe while enhancing the EU’s visibility and impact in the region.
Security and military mobility were highlighted as central components of the project. The five nations reaffirmed their intention to prioritize Corridor 8 within the framework of closer EU-NATO cooperation, contributing to the defense of the South-Eastern and Eastern flanks of the Alliance. The declaration recalls the 2024 Washington Summit Letter of Intent, which established plans for a Harmonized Military Mobility Corridor along Corridor 8.
From an economic perspective, the declaration emphasizes that investments in sustainable, resilient, and interoperable infrastructure are vital for the gradual integration of the region into the EU’s Single Market. Funding is expected to come from European instruments such as the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), IPA III, and the Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF). The document also condemns Russia’s war against Ukraine and reaffirms support for international efforts to achieve lasting peace.
The five countries agreed to institutionalize the five-party format as a permanent political platform to expedite Corridor 8’s development and ensure it remains a national and European priority. The declaration draws on prior discussions, including the first ministerial meeting in Brindisi in July 2023, Brussels talks in December 2025, and the 2024 Washington Summit agreement on a Harmonized Corridor for Military Mobility.
The ministers emphasized Corridor 8’s strategic value as a political, economic, and security framework that strengthens European convergence, regional cooperation, and the EU integration of the Western Balkans. Timely and coordinated project implementation is expected to overcome longstanding connectivity gaps, build trust among neighbors, and deepen people-to-people ties, particularly among youth.
Regional economic integration is a core objective, as Corridor 8 is designed to enhance trade flows, improve logistics, and strengthen supply chains, increasing resilience in crises. Investments in interoperable and sustainable infrastructure are crucial for linking the region to the EU Single Market.
On security matters, the corridor will play a key role in military mobility and broader defense initiatives under EU-NATO cooperation, while countering hybrid threats, disinformation, irregular migration, and external malign influence. Its development supports NATO’s regional plans and strengthens the security of the South-Eastern and Eastern flanks.
Finally, the ministers reiterated their commitment to mobilizing European funds, international financing, and public-private partnerships to ensure Corridor 8’s functionality and sustainability. The five-party format will continue as a permanent platform for political dialogue and coordination, accelerating the corridor’s development as a fully integrated element of European connectivity, prosperity, and security.
European Parliament member Thomas Waitz stressed the urgent need for greater political commitment in North Macedonia to overcome the ongoing deadlock on constitutional amendments, emphasizing that progress must remain merit-based and closely tied to funda

Quantum's big leap puts data centers in the spotlight

After decades confined largely to research labs, Quantum computing may be closer to its breakout moment than many on Wall Street expect.
The technology, which uses the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of the most powerful classical supercomputers, has long been described as futuristic. But rapid advancements have intensified investment in the sector and sparked discussions about how these powerful computers will integrate with industries like the already booming data center sector.
"By the end of the decade, we are confident that we will have machines in data centers that have commercial value," Zulfi Alam, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Quantum, told CNBC.
"I would not be able to say this with this much clarity last year, but this year, I can state to claim that by 2029 you will have machines that will have commercial [value], meaning that they will be doing calculations that classical machines cannot do," said Alam, who's leading the development of the company's scalable quantum machine.
Classical computers use switches, or bits, to either pass through or block an electric current at any given moment to perform calculations. The larger the number of bits, the greater the computing power. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use the ability of some materials at extremely low temperatures to exist in both an 'on' and 'off' state at the same time. This allows quantum bits, or qubits, to perform the same calculations at vastly greater speeds.
Microsoft, which last year revealed a new quantum computing chip called Majorana, is among the hyperscalers — companies that provide computing capacity that can rapidly expand as demand rises — like Google and Amazon that are investing heavily in the technology.
Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he is also seeing hyperscalers and platform vendors ramp up investment through cloud access, pricing controls and developer platforms, while the defense sector is investing early in both quantum computing and networking.
Governments are stepping up their investments too, with China leading with just short of $18 billion in public investment in quantum technology, followed closely by the EU, according to the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE), a think tank.
Most industry roadmaps now place the implementation of these systems in the 2028–2032 timeframe, according to Ellie Brown, quantum computing and cloud economics analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
UBS sees the advantages of quantum computing arriving by the early 2030s, even as company roadmaps are positioning for this earlier, said Madeleine Jenkins, analyst at UBS. "A lot of companies are telling me that 2027 is going to be a big year for quantum in terms of roadmap, in terms of what's achieved," she said.
Taken together, these timelines signal a sector moving steadily toward real‑world deployment, while raising important questions about how today's data infrastructure will need to evolve to support it.
Changing the energy demand
In a 103-page report published in January, UBS analysts led by Jenkins said the industry is close to completing a quantum computer that could cost tens of millions of dollars to build but has the ability to solve a problem in 200 seconds that would take a conventional supercomputer 10,000 years.
When it comes to the impact on the data center ecosystem, experts told CNBC that quantum could potentially lower the energy needs of the power-hungry facilities while also reducing the workloads needed for training AI.

In terms of energy, quantum computing would require a "fraction of what a data center would use," Jenkins said.
"The big thing is time; if you're taking the same problem that would take thousands and thousands of... hours, and you're replacing that with a quantum computer that takes seconds or minutes, then obviously you just need a lot less energy," she said.
Microsoft's Alam also noted the lower power requirements of quantum computers, highlighting that Majorana 1 is "showcasing more power than the entire computation of the entire planet [in] the palm of your hands and it's not running super-hot. It's running cold."
While quantum technology is advancing rapidly, it is unlikely in the near term to displace the classical computing that data centers currently host.
"Ideally, the entire efficiency of a problem-solving workload will go down, but it's not going to be a complete substitution," S&P's Brown said.
Microsoft's Alam stressed that quantum systems will not operate in isolation. "A quantum machine is not a standalone entity. It's a hybrid tool. It's a quantum accelerator that needs a high-performance computer very close to it," he said.
Moor Insights & Strategy's Moorhead also noted that if quantum scales, it will likely play a complementary role, adding a new class of "special infrastructure" within data centers and shifting facility design toward "quantum pods" which come with their own power and thermal needs.
"It will not displace the dominant energy driver near-term, which is AI data center expansion, but it will add pockets of specialized load and operational complexity," he told CNBC via emailed comments.
Ultimately, it's likely to change the shape of demand, but not the scale, with the AI boom remaining a key driver of demand for the facilities.
Roadblocks ahead
Building that kind of system inside real data‑center environments won't be straightforward and could require entirely new purpose-built facilities.
Only a handful of specialized quantum computers are currently deployed in data centers, with quantum vendors currently brainstorming a set of industry standards to help streamline broader adoption, according to Brown and S&P analyst Kelly Morgan.
There is still a significant amount of bespoke work that needs to be done in order to integrate quantum systems into data centers, Brown said, adding that, "we're lacking some quantum talent to make use of that and get that installed effectively."
But in the long term, she anticipates "a nice interplay between quantum and some of the other data center areas including AI" where the two could work together to solve problems.
Tim Adams, president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance, said that these hurdles reinforce the need for continued investment in data‑center infrastructure over the next decade.
"Data centers are necessary to move technological transformation forward and should be thought of as one of a number of likely investments on the road to very transformational achievements we are sure to see in the timeframe of the next ten years." Adams told CNBC.
And this phase has already begun, with Brown pointing to a burst of M&A activity aimed at building the capabilities needed for quantum's commercial phase.
"M&A has been massive over the past three months," Brown said, noting several acquisition announcements from quantum firm IonQ. "There's been a lot of positioning within the space not only to help improve quantum talent and technology, but also to help control that supply chain a little bit."
Along with the opportunities that quantum computing offers, when it comes to risks, data security is arguably the biggest one.
According to UBS, a powerful enough quantum computer could break current encryption methods, meaning that security systems would no longer be reliable. The report by the Swiss bank warns that companies will have to implement new quantum-safe encryption techniques, and that investment in these will have to start in the next few years.
Even with this surge of investment, Microsoft's Alam warned that the path ahead won't be easy. It's going to take a lot of "blood, sweat and tears," he said, anticipating numerous challenges as quantum machines come online — from meeting performance benchmarks to solving complex technical problems — all of which need to "converge at the right time" for the real magic to happen.
