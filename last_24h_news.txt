Dozens of Iraqi nationals repatriated from al-Hol, leaving the camp ‘practically empty’
191 Iraqi nationals from Syria’s al-Hol have been repatriated to their country, the United Nationals High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Friday, as authorities look to evacuate the camp’s residents and close the facilities.
UNHCR representative Gonzalo Vargas Llosa said the agency provided full logistical and field support throughout the residents’ journey "from community sensitization and registration to accompanying the convoy to the border".
Al-Hol camp, located in Syria’s Al-Hassakeh governorate approximately 13 kilometres from the Iraqi border, housed upwards of 73,000 residents after the defeat of the Islamic State group in 2019 and was controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
It was notorious for its violence and poor conditions.
After Syrian government forces captured it from the SDF last month, authorities began mass repatriation efforts for its residents with the aim of closing the facility.
Al-Hol hosted families from more than 20 Arab and foreign nationalities. The country with the largest number of citizens at the camp has been Iraq, with Iraqis at one point numbering about 24,000 people.
Some of the residents had family members in the Islamic State extremist group members but others were displaced due to fighting along the border.
Speaking to The New Arab’s sister outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, Iraqi military adviser Major General Safaa al-Aasam said the current emphasis of rapidly transferring Iraqis from al-Hol is "an urgent necessity imposed by security considerations" as well as "growing risks to societal stability and national security".
"The continued presence of thousands of Iraqis, including women and children, in the camp for long periods exacerbates security challenges", al-Aasam says.
"The fragile environment inside camps can contribute to the creation of complex social and psychological conditions, which may negatively affect the future of returnees if rehabilitation and social reintegration programs are delayed".
The families repatriated on Friday were received by Iraqi authorities along the border and transferred to designated rehabilitation centres at al-Jadaa camp in the Nineveh governorate.
There, the residents are expected to undergo rehabilitation courses before being allowed to return to the homes which they were forced to leave prior to the occupation of the Islamic State group in the country from 2014.
"This requires treating their return as a humanitarian priority to ensure their protection and reintegration into Iraqi society within a safe and stable environment", the Major General said, adding that children make up the largest portion of Iraqis in the camp and are "victims of exceptional circumstances".
There have been at least 33 batches of repatriations since the camp's control was transferred to Syrian government authorities, with only a few thousand residents believed to be left.
The UNHCR’s Vargas Llosa, in his statement on Friday, said the camp was left "practically empty".
The Iraqi government had said it expected to complete the repatriation of its citizens from al-Hol by the end of 2026 or early 2027, with the aim of closing the al-Hol camp and dismantling its infrastructure altogether.
The US military has been involved in the transfer to Iraq of IS militants previously held at detention camps in Syria, where Baghdad has said they will be prosecuted and tried.

U.K. considering removing Andrew from line of royal succession after arrest

British government considering removing former Prince Andrew from line of succession to the crown after arrest
The British government is considering formally removing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession to the crown following his arrest over revelations in the documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.
It would be a bold move that could preserve the dignity of the British royal family as it faces its worst crisis in generations. It would be a blow for the former prince, who remains eighth in line to the throne despite losing his status and his honors last year.
"If only they'd stop treating it with kid gloves and treat it as an institution which is useful and does a good job and is not lavishly expensive and all of that, then I think the monarchy will and should survive," said David Dimbleby, the author of "What Is the Monarch For?"
In addition to a legislative act from Parliament, removing Andrew from the line of succession would require the agreement of 14 Commonwealth countries.
Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday, held for 11 hours and then released under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.
He was arrested on suspicion of misconduct while in public office, not for any offenses involving his many documented encounters with young women linked to Epstein. Among the trove of documents released by the U.S. government are emails indicating the royal may have shared confidential U.K. government information with Epstein about his trips to Southeast Asia, and possible investment opportunities in Afghanistan, in 2010-2011.
Andrew was an official trade representative for the British government at the time.
British police continue to search Andrew's home as part of the investigation and have begun to question his former close protection officers for information relevant to their inquiries.
After pledging to support the police investigation into his brother's relationship with the late convicted sex offender Epstein, King Charles reiterated his intentions to the British public.
"My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all," he said in a statement signed "Charles R.," using the abbreviation for Rex, the Latin word for king.
The simple fact that Charles made the statement showed the scale of the problem. Andrew is the first senior member of the royal family to be arrested in about 400 years, when King Charles I was arrested and executed during the English Civil War.
Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing linked to his longtime friendship with Epstein. If convicted of misconduct while in public office, he could face life in prison.

‘Ella McCay’ isn’t the real McCoy, relatable ‘Real Estate,’ and JFK Jr.’s ‘Love Story’

James L. Brooks, 85, is one of the most beloved Jewish-American directors and television creators of all time, and it is a cause for celebration that he has just released his first feature film in 15 years, Ella McCay, which is streaming in Israel on Disney+ and Apple TV+. Its theatrical release here was canceled at the last minute.
It’s not a great movie, though, and that’s too bad – although seeing it may give you some idea of how good he can be. Brooks began his career in television, and created three of the best comedy series of all time: The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which was a groundbreaking look at the life of a single woman; Taxi, about a bunch of cab drivers, with an amazing cast that included Judd Hirsch, Tony Danza, Andy Kaufman, Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, and Danny DeVito; and The Simpsons, which is still running – and still funny – after 37 years.
Brooks also wrote and directed for the big screen, and made three of the funniest and most distinctive dramedies of all time: Terms of Endearment (1983), which won five Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson); Broadcast News (1987); and As Good As It Gets (1997), which won Oscars for Nicholson again and Helen Hunt.
Anyone interested in the behind-the-scenes of journalism should see Broadcast News, which is probably the movie I would take to a desert island if I could only have one. It features such unforgettable lines as, “Wouldn’t this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If ‘needy’ were a turn-on?”
The character who uttered this immortal line was played by Albert Brooks (no relation to the director), who is also in Ella McCay. The movie is the story of a sweet, earnest, nerdy young woman who suddenly finds herself the governor of a Midwestern state and must deal with political dealmaking she is too honest to handle and the simultaneous implosion of her personal life.
The movie has a great cast in addition to Brooks, who plays the former governor, and includes Jamie Lee Curtis (Freakier Friday) as the wise aunt we all wish we had; Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge on The Simpsons) as Ella’s loyal secretary; Spike Fearn as her introverted brother; Ayo Edebiri (who stars in The Bear) as her brother’s love interest; Woody Harrelson of Cheers as Ella’s philandering father; Jack Lowden from Slow Horses as her weak, egotistical husband; and Kumail Nanjiani from Silicon Valley as the state trooper assigned to protect her.
Two stories squished together
The cast is headed by Emma Mackey, a beautiful but rather inexpressive young British actress who was in Eiffel and Death on the Nile (where she played Gal Gadot’s rival). She is simply too gorgeous and too composed to be the lovable nerd the movie must have at its center. Unlike Holly Hunter, who played the pivotal female role in Broadcast News and who could convince us that her single-minded devotion to her job and her mixture of arrogance and insecurity could drive people away from her, Mackey just makes Ella super nice. And super nice, in a full-length movie, can become super annoying.
But Mackey is only one of the problems with the movie, which is really two stories squished together in a way that just doesn’t work. It’s meant to be a political comedy about an innocent in politics, like Frank Capra’s Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, filled with lovable, quirky eccentrics, and also a more psychologically minded story about a young woman who struggles with the trauma of her dysfunctional childhood, only to find that she has married a man who isn’t good enough for her and who worries about how to help her agoraphobic brother. It reels back and forth between the two and never really hits its stride.
This being a Brooks movie, there are a few good lines. Albert Brooks, as the ethically challenged governor, tells Ella, “To get anything done in this job, you have to make dumb people feel less dumb,” and her brother says, “Personally, I’ve decided to stop trying to be normal and pick something easier.” If this review has inspired you to seek out some movies by Brooks, you can stream As Good As It Gets on Netflix and Apple TV+ in Israel. Most of Brooks’s films are available abroad on Amazon Prime Video.
Real Estate: A Love Story – Netflix
A recent Israeli movie that just became available on Netflix, Real Estate: A Love Story, has quite a bit of the spirit of Brooks’ early works in a story of a couple whose relationship becomes strained when they face the very relatable dilemma of being priced out of Tel Aviv and contemplate moving to Haifa. It won the Israeli Feature Film Competition at the Haifa International Film Festival and is funny in a dark, quintessentially Israeli way. But it also touches universal truths about the economic pressure on relationships, and how scary the prospect of having a child can be for young people who don’t exactly feel grown up themselves.
Here’s an example of the film’s humor. As the couple approaches a spotless and affordable apartment tower with an elevator, which is an indescribable contrast to their rundown building in Tel Aviv that has been condemned by the municipality, the husband, Adam (Leib Lev Levin), a food deliveryman and aspiring musician, says, “This place is the essence of everything that’s f***ed up about humanity. Doesn’t that bother you?” His very pregnant wife, Tamara (Victoria Rosovsky), replies, “Not at the moment. Can we go up, Che Guevara?”
Director/writer Anat Malz has made an amazing debut film that deals not only with apartment hunting, but also with the gap between our dreams and aspirations and our actual lives. If it were any other time, this movie would be playing in theaters and festivals all over the world, and it’s great that it’s now on Netflix.
Love Story – John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette – Disney+
A series about a very different couple is now streaming on Disney+, Love Story – John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette, and although it obviously has a tragic ending, it provides some escapist fun along the way. Set in the ‘90s, it’s a little like Sex and the City, if that was about the Kennedys. As crazy as this sounds, I think that’s what the creators were going for – and they don’t skimp on sex scenes.
Kennedy (Paul Anthony Kelly) obviously had his pick of women and had high-profile romances with Sarah Jessica Parker and Daryl Hannah (who is played by Dree Hemingway, Mariel’s daughter in the series), before he found Bessette (Sarah Pidgeon).
Bessette was a stylist and saleswoman for Calvin Klein, and the demanding designer has a significant role, played by Alessandro Nivola, who had a supporting part in The Brutalist. She lives in a world where everything is fabulous and everyone looks great, but somehow she doesn’t crave the limelight for herself, a big point in her favor in Kennedy’s eyes.
Much of the first three episodes that were released to the press focus on Kennedy’s relationship with his mother, Jackie Onassis (Naomi Watts, who is arguably the best Jackie impersonator on screen), particularly how she tries to guide him to finding a wife who will be a good partner for him after she is diagnosed with cancer. These scenes fit with what is known about Jackie: that she was a caring mother who helped her children emerge as unscathed as anyone could from the media circus they were born into.
Kelly, a newcomer, has the unenviable task of playing one of the 20th century’s handsomest men, who was known in the tabloid press as “The Hunk,” and does a decent job. Much less is known about Bessette except for her patrician good looks, and Pidgeon manages to give her some feistiness. Rumors were swirling at the time of their deaths in a 1999 plane crash – in which Kennedy was the pilot and Bessette and her sister were passengers – that the couple was on the verge of divorce.
The series deals with the rumors but plays them down, obviously, since it is called Love Story. Ryan Murphy was one of the executive producers, and the series is slick and watchable like all his ventures, including American Crime Story, Glee, and Feud. Among the directors are Max Winkler, Henry’s son, and Jesse Peretz, Marty’s son.

Thousands march in France for slain far-right activist under heavy security
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LYON - Thousands of people marched in south-eastern France on Feb 21 under heavy security in tribute to a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left
The crowd – many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks – marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, “justice for Quentin” and “the extreme left kills”.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
Authorities had deployed heavy security, including drones, fearing further clashes at the event, which was widely publicised online by ultra-nationalist and far-right groups and had been expected to draw thousands.
Hours before the gathering, French President Emmanuel Macron had urged “everyone to remain” calm and said his government would hold a meeting next week to discuss “violent action groups” in the wake of the fatal beating, which has ignited tensions between the left and right ahead of the 2027 presidential vote.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate,” said Mr Macron, who will be unable to contest 2026’s election after hitting the two-term limit. “There is no place for militias, no matter where they come from.”
The regional prefect Fabienne Buccio, said no calls to organise a counter protest had been seen on social media but that security would be deployed into the evening to head off any clashes.
“We will not tolerate the slightest incident during the march, just as we will not tolerate any incident on its sidelines,” she said.
‘Defend his memory’
Before the procession set off, mourners gathered in the church frequented by Mr Deranque before his death and his portrait was hung from the facade of the administrative headquarters of the Auvergne–Rhone-Alpes region.
Laurent, a friend of Mr Deranque, attended “to defend his memory” in the setting “where Quentin expressed himself most intensely, namely the Catholic Church and the traditional rite,” he said.
One of the rally’s organisers, Aliette Espieux, former spokesperson for the anti-abortion movement, told AFP she wished for a “peaceful tribute”.
She hit out, however, at Mr Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally party, which senses its best chance ever of scoring the presidency in 2026’s vote.
Mr Bardella had urged his supporters not to attend the rally, with Ms Espieux saying, “I don’t find that very honourable.”
According to the Deranque family’s lawyer, Fabien Rajon, his parents will not take part in the rally, which they hoped would go ahead “without violence” and “without political statements”.
Several ultra-right-wing groups, including Mr Deranque’s nationalist Allobroges Bourgoin faction, had nonetheless heavily publicised the march on social media, stoking authorities’ concerns of unrest if far-right and hard-left activists from elsewhere in Europe travelled to France for the event.
Calls to ban rally
Ahead of the Lyon rally, some residents living near the march’s planned route had barricaded the ground floor windows of their apartments.
“At my age, I’m not going to play the tough guy. If I have to go out somewhere, I’ll avoid the places where they’re marching,” said Lyon local Jean Echeverria, 87.
“They’ll just keep fighting each other, it’ll never end. Between the extreme of this and the extreme of that, it’s non-stop,” he added.
The rally went ahead despite Lyon’s left-wing green mayor, Gregory Doucet, asking the state to ban it, telling reporters he did not “want Lyon to be the capital of the far-right, at any point”.
LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard backed the Lyon mayor’s call for a ban, warning on X that the march would be a “fascist demonstration”.
But Interior Minister Laurent Nunez declined to ban the rally, arguing that he had to “strike a balance between maintaining public order and freedom of expression” and pledging an “extremely large police deployment”.
Mr Deranque’s death has provoked a reaction from US President Donald Trump’s administration, with State Department official Sarah Rogers on Feb 20 branding the killing “terrorism” and claiming that “violent radical leftism is on the rise”.
Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to a radical left-wing MP has also been charged with complicity. AFP

Barry Manilow reschedules more concerts to recover from cancer surgery
Manilow called his recent visit to the surgeon ‘very depressing’

Barry Manilow has been forced to postpone more concerts following cancer-related surgery.
The 82-year-old “Copacabana” crooner revealed his lung cancer diagnosis in December, saying it was “found early.” He underwent surgery to remove a spot on his left lung, postponing his Las Vegas residency and several planned tour dates to recover. Manilow then announced earlier this month that he would need to reschedule certain performances a second time.
Then, in a Friday social media post, Manilow described his most recent visit to the surgeon ahead of his anticipated return to the stage as “very depressing.” Despite “using the treadmill three times a day” to prepare for his upcoming arena tour dates, his surgeon advised against him resuming the planned performances.
“He said, ‘Barry, you won’t be ready to do a 90-minute show. Your lungs aren’t ready yet. You’re in great shape considering what you’ve been through, but your body isn’t ready. You shouldn’t do the first arena shows. You won’t make it through,’” Manilow wrote.
“Deep down, I wanted to go back. But, my body knew what my heart didn’t want to admit: I wasn’t ready,” he continued, sharing that he was rescheduling his “first batch” of concerts slated for February 27 through March 17.
“He said I could likely do the Vegas shows at the very end of March, and the second batch of arena shows beginning in April. I’m so, so sorry I have to reschedule some of these first arena shows again.”
Manilow did, however, vow that he “will come back.”
“In the meantime, and once again, thank you all for your wonderful notes and phone calls of support,” Manilow wrote. “The doctor said that my body had been through hell and that it needed time to heal. So, I’m going back to healing.”
Earlier this month, Manilow revealed that he needed to postpone the previously rescheduled Las Vegas residency dates yet again.
“With my doctor’s guidance and recommendation, however, we have decided to postpone my residency dates at Westgate Las Vegas from 12-21 February so I can stay focused on healing and getting ready for the tour that’s kicking off at the end of February. Having a few extra weeks to rest and prepare is what the doctor ordered!”
The shows were previously announced as his farewell tour and the dates are listed on his website as “The Last Concerts.”
The Grammy-winning artist’s career has spanned over six decades. In that time, he’s released more than 30 studio albums, including 1978’s Even Now, which features his best-known hit “Copacabana,” as well as three major singles, “Even Now,” “Can’t Smile Without You” and “Somewhere in the Night.” Manilow’s other top hits include “Mandy,” “Somewhere Down the Road”,and “Could It Be Magic.”

Palestinian Authority sets up Gaza liaison office
The Palestinian Authority has established a liaison office headed by Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa to coordinate with the office of the High Representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov, Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh announced on Saturday.
Al-Sheikh said the office "is now ready to fully assume its duties", describing it as a formal channel for coordination in the implementation of President Donald Trump’s twenty-point peace plan and UN Security Council Resolution 2803.
In a letter addressed to Mladenov, al-Sheikh wrote: "His Excellency Mr Nickolay Mladenov, High Representative for Gaza / Peace Council. We are pleased to express our welcome of the statement issued by your office on 20 February 2026 regarding the establishment of a liaison office by the Palestinian Authority, and your affirmation of the importance of this institutional framework for communication and coordination."
He added that this "came within the framework of ensuring the success of the efforts led by President Donald Trump and supporting the political path aimed at achieving stability and peace."
Al-Sheikh had earlier welcomed Mladenov’s announcement of the creation of a liaison mechanism affiliated with the Palestinian National Authority, aimed at providing "an official channel for coordination and communication between the Office of the Peace Council Representative and the Palestinian Authority" to implement Trump’s plan and Security Council Resolution 2803.
In his letter, the Palestinian vice president reiterated support for the political framework underpinning the initiative. "
We have welcomed President Trump’s twenty-point plan, as well as UN Security Council Resolution 2803 (2025), the establishment of the High Representative’s office, and the formation of the National Committee for the Administration of the Gaza Strip," he wrote.
He described these steps as "practical transitional steps that contribute to alleviating the suffering of our people and providing administrative and security services, in a way that does not create administrative, legal, and security duplication between our people in Gaza and the West Bank, and that consolidates the principle of one system, one law, and unified legitimate arms."
Al-Sheikh confirmed that he had formally informed Mladenov of the office’s establishment under Mustafa’s leadership, stating that it "is now ready to fully assume its duties, ensuring a clear and organised channel for coordination and communication with your office".
The announcement signals renewed coordination between the Palestinian Authority and international actors involved in post-war governance arrangements for Gaza, amid ongoing diplomatic efforts aimed at stabilising the territory and advancing a political settlement.

Myth that won’t die: The false link between settlements and Palestinian violence - opinion

The world reacts curiously to events in Israel, especially when they have the ability to influence the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
When Israel announces a new policy as it pertains to Jews purchasing land in historically Jewish Judea and Samaria (the region most of the world calls the West Bank), voices decry Israeli programs that can ignite the region in violence. Similarly, when Palestinians commit terror attacks against innocent Israelis, there are immediate calls for calm to ensure there are no violent flare-ups in the region.
These strange responses ignore Palestinian agency over their own violent choices and place the blame on Israel for Palestinian terrorism. Since Palestinians have traditionally chosen violence and terrorism over peace, the world should be looking inward and asking if 100 years of not holding Palestinians accountable for their own terrible choices has been the true provocation of violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
When discussing Jewish development in Judea and Samaria, there are two problematic responses. One is advocated by those who demand further building, since, “Settlements are the best Israeli response to Palestinian terrorism because they exact an actual price from the Palestinians for their recalcitrance.”
A second problematic response, as stated this week by the Democratic Majority for Israel, says that, “The Israeli security cabinet’s approval of measures that would increase Israeli control over parts of the West Bank…could risk further escalating tensions at a delicate time.”
It must be stated clearly: Jews do not inspire, motivate, or cause Palestinians to be violent; Palestinian violence arises from their own aggressive choices and unyielding aspirations for a terror state. Jewish building in our historic homeland is a rightful act that deters terror through strength and demoralization, paving the way for true peace.
In the decades leading up to the failed Oslo Accords, and in the short time following them before they literally blew up, the shortsighted thought process was that approving measures for increased Israeli control in Judea and Samaria pushes Israelis and Palestinians further apart, escalates tensions, and complicates regional integration. This as an outdated 1990s mindset that wrongly attributes Palestinian violence to Jewish presence rather than inherently violent Palestinian ideologies and hate towards Jews.
Other than erroneous theories, there is no empirical evidence that links Jewish construction to spikes in terrorism.
Palestinian violence against Jews persists regardless of settlements
This evidence doesn’t exist because Palestinian violence against Jews persists regardless of building development or freezes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s mistaken building and settlements freeze yielded no peace. Even the Oslo Peace Accords, the closest Israel and the Palestinians came to ending the conflict, brought Palestinian terrorism. Blaming Jews for Palestinian actions infantilizes Palestinians, denying their agency and excusing terrorism.
The narratives claiming that Jewish development in Judea and Samaria brings violence, or should grow as a response to Palestinian terrorism, are both incorrect. Jewish building should proceed because it is an inherent Jewish right in our ancestral homeland, not contingent on Palestinian behavior. It is the only just policy the world should advocate in Judea and Samaria.
Jewish building increases infrastructure, benefiting all residents, including Palestinians. Since taking over Judea and Samaria in 1967, Israel has built roads, utilities, and economic opportunities that foster stability rather than conflict. Jewish building in these disputed regions reaffirms Jews’ historical claim to Judea and Samaria, strengthening Israel’s position and preventing the area from becoming a launchpad for attacks.
In addition, Jewish expansion in the region hampers Palestinian terror by undermining their aspirations for territorial integrity and a unified state dedicated to destroying the Jewish State of Israel. Building more Jewish towns, homes, and community centers demoralizes Palestinian extremists and deters violence by showing that aggression yields losses, not gains.
There have been over a thousand unnecessary Palestinian deaths since October 2023. These deaths are consequences of Palestinian aggression, including initiating terror attacks against innocent Israelis, using human shields, and pointlessly clashing with security forces. It is Palestinian violence that causes Palestinian deaths, not unprovoked Israeli actions.
In contrast to Israeli restraint and defensive measures, Palestinians choose confrontation over coexistence. Blaming Jews ignores the root causes of violence and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, like incitement in Palestinian education and media. Israel has held out its hand in peace for over 100 years. Unfortunately, it is continuously met by Palestinian fists.
Since the failure of the Oslo Accords and the peace process, it has been made clear that peace won’t emerge from conceding to Palestinian demands for a “terror state,” which would reward violence and endanger Israel. It is now clear that peace will only come to this region when Israelis fully incorporate Judea and Samaria into Israel. The Jewish state should annex the region as a right and as a demonstration of strength, deterring further aggression and integrating it under stable governance.
All Zionists should support Jewish expansion and annexation of Judea and Samaria as moral and practical imperatives. True peace will only be achieved through Jewish resolve, not concessions. The unapologetic Jewish resolve to further Zionist goals of development of the Jewish homeland will inspire a shift in global discourse.
In summary, it must be unequivocally stated and restated that Jews are not the instigators, motivators, or causes of Palestinian violence. The tragic cycle of violence and terrorism stems entirely from Palestinians’ own deliberate choices to embrace aggression over coexistence. All Zionists must rally behind Jewish expansion and the full annexation of Judea and Samaria, recognizing these as both moral imperatives rooted in our ancient rights and practical necessities for security and deterrence.
True peace will not arise from futile concessions that reward terror but through unwavering Jewish resolve, which demoralizes extremists and fosters stability. By championing this path, we can inspire a profound shift in global discourse, finally holding Palestinians accountable and paving the way for a just resolution.

US global tariffs will rise to 15%, Donald Trump says
The US President said the rate would be increased ‘effective immediately’.
- Bookmark
Donald Trump has announced 15% global tariffs in a move the British Chambers of Commerce warned would deal a further blow to UK businesses.
The US President initially said he would impose a 10% levy after the Supreme Court struck down his previous import taxes on Friday.
But in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, he said he would be increasing this to the higher rate “effective immediately”.
Britain’s biggest business organisation swiftly expressed dismay at the announcement and urged the Government to continue dialogue with US counterparts to keep the UK’s competitive advantage.
“We had feared that the President’s plan B response could be worse for British businesses and so it is proving,” William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC said.
“This means an extra 5% increase in tariffs on a wide range of UK goods exports to the US, except those covered under the Economic Prosperity Deal.
“This will be bad for trade, bad for US consumers and businesses and weaken global economic growth. Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic need a period of clarity and certainty. Higher tariffs are not the way to achieve that.”
The UK Government repeated its assertion that it expects Britain’s “privileged trading position with the US” to continue, when approached for comment on the announcement of a new 15% rate.
Britain had received the lowest tariff rate of 10%, and a subsequent agreement struck by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Trump saw further carve-outs for the country’s steel industry and car manufacturers.
Questions remain over whether those deals still stand, although officials are understood to believe the changes would not have an impact on most of the UK’s trade with America, including preferential arrangements on steel, cars and pharmaceuticals.
A Government spokesperson said: “This is a matter for the US to determine but we will continue to support UK businesses as further details are announced.
“Under any scenario, we expect our privileged trading position with the US to continue and will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world.”

Living on pins and needles: Israel faces uncertainty at the prospect of war - opinion

With critical security clocks ticking on all fronts from Gaza to Iran, residents of the State of Israel find themselves sitting on shpilkes – a Yiddish phrase for living on pins and needles, in a state of extreme uncertainty, in nervous anticipation.
We totter between reports of an imminent massive military strike on Iran (and the expected Iranian counterattack on Israel) and contradictory reports which suggest foolish diplomatic dealing that once again lets Iran off the hook.
We wonder who will prevail: US President Trump’s ego or Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s eschatology? Trump’s tenacity or Khamenei's grip on power? American superpower or Iranian expertise at rope-a-doping American presidents?
We speculate on the degree of damage the Israeli homefront will have to absorb in a war-to-end-all-wars with Iran and guesstimate what level of miraculous Divine interventions will have to kick in to protect Israel as they did last June.
In the meantime, we try to book a haircut only to learn that our barber is on emergency call-up duty in the air defense reserves. We plan an expensive family event or a complicated professional conference, half-expecting it to be cancelled, likely leaving us with a substantial financial hit.
Prospect of war makes everyday decision-making difficult
We hold concert tickets for next week, but are skeptical that the band or audience will be able to show. We plan a large Purim party, but know that we may be drinking wine alone in our mamad (bombproof home bunker).
We book airline tickets for a Passover getaway, or make hotel reservations for a summertime vacation, and then buy every possible travel cancellation insurance at exorbitant fees because everything is a safek, at question, in doubt.
We fall into bein hashemashot (literally, between the suns). In Jewish tradition and religious law, this is the twilight period between sundown and nightfall, between one day and the next. It is a time when decision-making is indeterminate and confusing. Things can go any which way.
We fall into catalepsy, a psychological condition characterized by trance or temporary paralysis. It is hard to function with any degree of comfort in this grey zone, this liminal space. It is nightmare time.
In short, the current moment of personal insecurity is unnerving. We all feel that, willy-nilly, it is time for forthright, audacious moves.
The current period of defense and diplomatic ambiguity holds strategic danger, too. The muddied situation cannot be prolonged. The dillydallying is destructive.
Aside from the fact that Iran is using the time to advance its nuclear and missile programs and prepare its global offenses, the main danger here is fragmentation on the political level. Overextension of the current holding period could lead to collapse in US-Israel ties, which, of course, is exactly what the enemy is hoping for.
Already, there are signs of dissolution in Washington. Pro-Iranian and isolationist forces are disseminating lies about the “disaster” that would result from US military action against Iran. Tucker Carlson: “Thousands of Americans would almost certainly be killed at bases throughout the Middle East.”
Nasty wags like Thomas Friedman are accusing Israel of dragging the US into war – “spitting in America’s face,” and “playing Trump for a sucker and American Jews for fools.”
(Tommy Friedman can always be counted upon to pop up at critical moments to slander Israel and undermine US-Israel relations. This week, he excreted from his bottomless cave of Netanyahu-hatred to accuse Israel of “threatening broader US interests in the Middle East and the security of Jews all over the world” because of its “morally reckless,” “messianically driven,” and “apartheid-like” approach to Palestinian issues and its “nonsense” about Iran. He managed to use the epithets apartheid, pariah, and ethnic cleansing regarding Israel six times one op-ed column.)
All this eats away at America’s deterrent power and Trump’s maneuvering room versus Iran.
Because of Carlson, Friedman, and their ilk, it is necessary to remind the global policy community of the necessity to truly end Iran’s hegemonic ambitions and threatening abilities.
Of course, regime change leading to a democratic Iranian government not guided by radical Islamic theology would be sweet. But since nobody knows how to bring this about in the near term, we need to be clear about the parameters of a deal “that would be just as good as if you won militarily” (a phrase used recently by Trump).
Such a win would entail complete Iranian disarmament – full, permanent, and verifiable dismantlement, export, or in-place destruction of Iran’s uranium and plutonium production assets; anytime-anywhere inspections; and an end to nuclear weapons R&D.
It would also mean termination of Iran’s ballistic missile, cruise missile, and drone arsenals; an end to Iran’s illicit nuclear and missile imports and exports; and especially to its nuclear, missile, and arms agreements with Russia, China, and North Korea. And an end to Tehran’s longtime support for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other proxy forces.
All this would require super-invasive monitoring of Iran’s bank accounts, uranium mines, mills, ore processing facilities, military and missile bases, ports and airfields, along with the destruction of Iran’s underground bunkers for nuclear activities and weapons storage.
In my view, the likelihood that Iranian leader Ayatollah Khamenei will agree to anything remotely resembling such an evisceration of Iranian sovereignty and supremacy is nil.
After all, Tehran has spent four decades and hundreds of billions of dollars developing its military power and regional ascendancy, accompanied by considerable suffering (“sacrifice”) of the Iranian people to this end. All this, based on deep ideological-religious conviction, on a dark eschatological vision that involves genocide against Israel and the West and downright destruction of enemy civilization.
Which leaves the military option. Get on with it. Destroy Iran’s key nodes of military power and revolutionary repression. Perhaps help Iranians free themselves from the ayatollahs. And free Israelis from suspense, from sitting on existential shpilkes.

Sandy Leigh’s journey from San Antonio to Jerusalem

One day in Jerusalem, I walked by a woman and stopped to ask about her extraordinary hat. The magnificence of the style and the colors in juxtaposition to the country’s constantly changing emotional landscape caught my imagination.
Originally created in the 16th century for nobility and royalty, the fascinator is a formal, elegant headpiece often combining lace, jewels, and feathers. It is usually fastened with a clip onto a hair band.
The woman I spoke to, Sandy Leigh, is as vibrant and fascinating as the hats she wears.
“I wear a different hat every day,” Leigh told me. “It began years ago when I moved to Washington, DC, to live near my son, Jeff, and my daughter-in-law, Lea, and to watch my grandchildren grow up. I had worked for years at TV stations in San Antonio, selling advertising time.
“When I moved to Washington, I continued in this profession. I was responsible for creating my own list of clients. I made cold calls in which I called people or businesses that had never advertised with us before, and arranged to give a presentation. A few days later, I would make a follow-up call,” she recounted.
Sandy Leigh’s fascination with hats and politics
Since Leigh was then in her 50s, much older than her co-workers, she identified herself as the older woman who made the presentation. However, being a young spirit, she soon discarded the adjective “older” and decided to wear one of her many handmade fascinators to work. Thus, she became the lady in the hat, and she has been wearing a hat ever since. In fact, there were 75 fascinators in her aliyah luggage.
In Washington, Leigh had exciting experiences living in America’s capital city. She attended president Bill Clinton’s inauguration, parade, and ball, and once attended a gathering at the home of the Clintons. A lobbyist friend would often invite her to special events, and she enjoyed the White House Correspondents’ Dinner for George W. Bush. She was no stranger to meeting politicians, and she personally met six US presidents.
In San Antonio and DC, she was passionate about helping her community, promoting Jewish causes and organizations, and advocating good government through politics.
“However,” she said with emphasis, “the two honors of my life, the two most rewarding things I have done in my life, are raising my two children and taking care of my mother. I am proud of my son and daughter because they are such good souls, kind and honorable. Joy means being with my wonderful children and beyond-wonderful grandchildren.”
When her mother needed her, Leigh moved back to San Antonio. “It was my privilege to help my mother for the last 10 years of her life. On the last day of her life, I sat with her and held her hand for hours. I played her favorite music from the ‘30s and ‘40s, and I sang to her. My mother said, ‘Sandy, you know you can’t sing, right?’ We laughed a lot together.”
Leigh's affinity to Israel was inspired by her parents.
“My parents were Zionists and supporters of Israel in their community. For years, my mother was active in Hadassah, the Women’s Zionist Organization of America. She was president of the San Antonio chapter and a member of the national board of Hadassah. My parents never made it to Israel, but I remember when my grandsons were born in Hadassah-University Medical Center, in Jerusalem’s Ein Kerem, my mother said to me, ‘Now I know what my life’s work was for.’”
This devotion and dedication to Israel are deep-rooted values Leigh instilled in her children.
“My son, Jeff Mendelsohn, has been a committed advocate for US-Israel relations since he was a kid,” she said.
“When he was a young boy, he wrote a poem honoring Israeli soldiers during the Yom Kippur War.”
Jeff was the national outreach director at AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, where he launched and led a program to encourage pro-Israel advocacy in non-Jewish constituencies. He also co-founded Pro-Israel America to help elect pro-Israel candidates to Congress on both sides of the aisle. He now works for the Jewish Federations of North America as associate vice president and devotes his professional life to strengthening Israel and serving the Jewish people.
Leigh’s daughter, Robyn Yakin, deepened this family connection to Israel. On her first visit here, she fell in love with the spirit of the country and with Eden, her now-husband. She knew it was her destiny to live in Israel, and she made aliyah 29 years ago. Robyn and Eden are happily raising their three sons, and Robyn works as an English teacher in elementary school, specializing in teaching remedial readers.
After caring for her mother, Leigh’s life journey led her to Israel to live close to Robyn, Eden, and her grandsons. In 2019, she made aliyah from San Antonio, Texas, and lives in Jerusalem.
Going for coffee, exploring the beautiful, winding Jerusalem streets, shopping, and Shabbat dinners with her family have become traditions.
After falling down several times, Leigh took the geriatric evaluation test at the Maccabi Healthcare Services clinic.
Afterward, the staff asked her, “Why are you so happy?”
She answered, “We have the ability to decide to be happy. I am tuned in to good things around me. Every morning when I wake up, I tell myself, ‘Something wonderful can happen to you today.’”
The staff quickly asked her to volunteer: “You look like you are waiting for someone to take you dancing. Can you help these people feel like they want to go dancing?”
I imagine, yes, she can. One of her favorite activities every week is volunteering with geriatric patients at Maccabi.
“The doctors, the staff, and the patients are wonderful,” she asserted.
In October 2024, when Iran struck Israel with drones and missiles, her daughter called her to ask to meet the next morning.
“But is it safe?” Sandy asked.
“Mom, this is Israel,” Robyn answered.
They met in the heart of Jerusalem. The streets were alive and crowded. This is a country of people being together and relying on one another. To choose aliyah is to choose a new beginning and a spiritual ascent. For Leigh, it encompasses optimism and wonderment.
“I am entranced by this country and by this city,” she said. “I am 84 years old, but I’m not letting the old lady in. I feel young again and rejuvenated. I began a new life here. I am always experiencing new things and learning everything all over again. The people around me make me feel happy. I like the vibe of Jerusalem, and I am inspired by the miracle of Israel.”
The world is uncertain and complicated, but Leigh looks for the good and finds good. She looks for the wonderful and finds wonderful.

Frescos of a peacock, fruit discovered in Roman villa near Pomepii belonging to Emperor Nero's wife

Archaeologists have uncovered a vibrant red fresco during excavations of a villa believed to have belonged to Emperor Nero's second wife in Naples, southern Italy, according to local media.
The discovery's announcement follow the site’s partial opening to the public for the first time.
Villa Poppaea, the Roman “pleasure villa,” is part of the ancient Oplontis, an archaeological site set not far from Pompeii. Like Pompeii, it was destroyed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE.
The site was first discovered in the 16th century, though excavations only began in the 18th.
In 1974, archaeologists discovered the remains of a second building nearby (known as Villa B) believed to have been used for processing wine and oil. These remains are closed to the public.
“Each excavation is a surprise,” the site’s director, Arianna Spinosa, told AFP. “We certainly expected to find some of the frescoes that could be seen on the other wall, but the surprises were, of course, far more numerous.”
Peacocks, bright red, blue pigment
The fresco was reportedly found in the villa's main salon, depicting the legs and body of a peacock emerging from mud, against the backdrop of a yellow frieze.
Giuseppe Scarpati, the site's chief archaeologist, explained to AFP that the peacock,which is the sacred animal associated with the Roman goddess Juno, is “one of the decorative motifs that recurs very frequently in the decoration of the villa.”
“We don't know its boundaries to the north, east, or west,” Scarpatti explained to AFP, which further added that only 50%-60% percent of the villa has been excavated. “Potentially, the villa could still hold many surprises for us.”
Other finds reportedly include depictions of birds, fish, and fruit in vibrant pigments identified by archaeologists as “bright red cinnabar and Egyptian blue pigments,” according to Elena Gravina, the chief conservator of the villa.
AFP noted that Gravina further explained that such pigments were expensive at the time, and are a testament to the “commercial connections and the wealth of the patrons, as well as the skill and expertise of the artisans.”

Israeli army kills 2 Palestinians in strikes on Gaza during Ramadan
Latest Israeli attacks bring total death toll in Gaza since October ‘ceasefire’ to 614.
Israeli air strikes killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza on the third day of Ramadan in the latest breach of the truce deal signed with Hamas more than four months ago.
The attacks on Saturday occurred in northern Gaza’s Jabalia camp and the Qizan an-Najjar area in southern Gaza.

The total death toll from Israel’s attacks since the “ceasefire” came into effect has risen to 614, with 1,640 more Palestinians wounded, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa.
Israel’s military appeared to acknowledge one of the attacks in a post on X, claiming its forces killed a fighter who crossed onto Israel’s side of the demarcation line in northern Gaza and approached its troops “in a manner that posed an immediate threat”.
The army said it would “continue to act to remove any immediate threat”.
‘Board of Peace’ deliberations
Saturday’s attacks come two days after US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace held its first-ever meeting addressing reconstruction, security, and governance in the war-battered Strip.
Trump announced at the gathering that nine countries committed $7bn for Gaza reconstruction efforts, on top of a $10bn contribution from the United States. While significant, the total is far short of the estimated $70bn needed to rebuild the devastated Palestinian territory.
Trump also said five countries pledged to send troops to participate in an eventual 20,000-strong International Stabilization Force (ISF), which is to take over security from Hamas. But the task of disarming Hamas – called for in the next stage of the deal – is still unresolved, threatening to delay or derail the entire process.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted Hamas must disarm before any reconstruction begins. Last week, a top Netanyahu aide said Israel planned to give Hamas a 60-day deadline to comply before resuming its war, an ultimatum the group rejected.
Hamas has said it will not relinquish its weapons as long as Israel continues occupying the Strip and discussions on any political process in Gaza “must start with the total halt of aggression”.
The group has said it is open to a peacekeeping force, but with caveats.
“We want peacekeeping forces that monitor the ceasefire, ensure its implementation, and act as a buffer between the occupation army and our people in the Gaza Strip, without interfering in Gaza’s internal affairs,” said Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem on Friday.
‘Unclear in vision’
Along with Hamas’s disarmament, the next stage of Trump’s plan for Gaza calls for the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli military and the ISF’s deployment, with a transitional Palestinian technocratic committee overseeing day-to-day governance.
Many Palestinians told Al Jazeera they are deeply sceptical about the plan’s prospects for success, citing Israel’s continued deadly attacks and lingering aid shortages.
“Israel kills, bombs, violates the ceasefire agreement daily and expands the buffer zone without anyone stopping it,” said Awad al-Ghoul, 70, a Palestinian displaced from Tal as-Sultan in southern Rafah and who now lives in a tent in the town of az-Zawayda.
“So this project is a failure from the start and unclear in vision.”

Suicide bombing kills 2 Pakistani soldiers, including lieutenant colonel in restive northwest
A suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a security convoy in northwest Pakistan bordering Afghanistan on Saturday, killing two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel, the Pakistani military said.
It said the attack took place in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where security forces have battled militants for years.
The military said Pakistan would not “exercise any restraint” and that operations against those responsible for the violence would continue “irrespective of their location,” language that appeared to signal rising tensions between Islamabad and Kabul.
No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban who have been blamed for previous such attacks. There was no immediate statement from the Afghan government.
The latest attack came two days after Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry summoned a senior Afghan diplomat and lodged a strong protest over a recent deadly attack on a security post that killed 11 Pakistani soldiers and a girl in the Bajaur district near the Afghan border.
Local police have said the man who carried out the attack in Bajaur was an Afghan national.
In separate statements, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the bombing and praised Lt. Col. Shehzad Gul and Sepoy Karamat Shah for sacrificing their lives.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant violence in recent years, much of it blamed on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, and outlawed Baloch groups. The TTP is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban, who returned to power in 2021. Islamabad accuses the TTP of operating from inside Afghanistan, a charge both the group and Kabul deny.
Relations between the neighboring countries have remained tense since October, when deadly border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants. The violence followed explosions in Kabul that Afghan officials blamed on Pakistan.
A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held, but subsequent talks in Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement, and relations remain strained.

Nasa moon rocket hit by new problem, pushing launch with astronauts into April
The Artemis II mission, set to be humanity’s first lunar flight in decades, is facing a helium flow issue just a day after a successful test
Nasa’s new moon rocket suffered another setback on Saturday, almost certain to bump astronauts’ first lunar trip in decades into spring.
The space agency revealed the latest problem just one day after targeting March 6 for the Artemis II mission, humanity’s first flight to the moon in more than half a century.
Overnight, the flow of helium to the rocket’s upper stage was interrupted, officials said. Solid helium flow is essential for purging the engines and pressurising the fuel tanks.
This helium issue has nothing to do with the hydrogen fuel leaks that marred a countdown dress rehearsal of the Space Launch System rocket earlier this month and forced a repeat test.
Nasa Administrator Jared Isaacman said a bad filter, valve or connection plate could be to blame for the stalled helium flow. Regardless of the cause, he noted, the only way to access the area and fix the problem is in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Centre.
“We will begin preparations for rollback, and this will take the March launch window out of consideration,” Isaacman said on social media. Nasa’s next opportunities would be at the beginning or end of April.

Over 1,000 councillors across the UK sign Palestine pledge ahead of key local elections
Over 1,000 politicians across Britain’s range of political parties have vowed support for the 'Pledge for Palestine' petition ahead of the crunch May local elections set to test many Labour-run councils.
According to the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which launched the campaign in December, the pledge commits the representatives to "uphold the rights of the Palestinian people" and "stand up to Israel for its crimes of genocide and apartheid".
The pledge also commits them to "ensure their councils are not complicit, including through divestment of pension funds from complicit companies".
With their signatures, the 1,028 councillors who have signed have vowed to tackle the issue of pension funds which invest in Israel-linked companies.
Reports suggest that local councils have invested more than £12.2 billion in companies with links to Israel, including in arms companies that manufacture parts for Israeli jets and other military infrastructure that has been used to destroy much of the besieged Gaza Strip.
Thirty-one councils had previously issued statements and passed motions in support of the divestment of pension funds from firms deemed complicit in Israel’s crimes.
The pledge has drawn the strongest support among Greens, with 345 signatories but 338 Labour councillors have also signed up. 104 councillors from the Liberal Democrats also signed the pledge.
Council representatives from the SNP, Plaid Cymru, Scottish Greens, Your Party, the Conservatives, local parties, and Independents have also signed the pledge.
"We’ve all seen the devastation caused by Israel’s genocide in Gaza, but none have felt it more deeply than Hackney residents I’ve spoken to who have lost family members in Palestine" said Zoë Garbett, a Green councillor from Hackney who signed the pledge.
"The council took a stand against South African apartheid and now it’s time we make a similar stand for the Palestinians".
Dr Hosnieh Djafari-Marbini, an independent councillor from Oxford city, said that "So many politicians have voiced their concerns about the Israeli crimes we have witnessed in recent times but very few have taken concrete action", adding that this campaign "highlights a candidate’s honesty, integrity, and consistency when it comes to application of international law".
Palestine a defining issue in upcoming local elections
Palestine has emerged as a pivotal issue shaping the UK’s upcoming local elections on 7 May, where over 4,850 councillor seats across English councils are contested.
Campaigners argue that Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s delayed call for a ceasefire alienated many Labour voters, fuelling four Labour losses to pro-Palestine independents in the July 2024 elections and mounting pressure from left-wing rivals.
Labour MP Richard Burgon warned that "Keir Starmer’s refusal to stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people is wrong and has already badly hurt Labour at the polls. We saw that in the last general election, and I fear we will see it again in the May local elections".
Burgon urged the government to listen to voices in the party "rightly demanding action against Israel's genocide and war crimes and do so before even more damage is done and we lose more hardworking, principled councillors".
Vote Palestine 2026 – an umbrella group comprising PSC, Palestinian Youth Movement Britain, The Muslim Vote, British Palestinian Committee, and Palestinian Forum in Britain – aims to keep the issue front and centre, mobilising voters to back pledge-signers and refute non-signatories.
Dan Iley-Williamson from the PSC stated: "The mass movement for Palestine – which has brought millions onto Britain’s streets – is not going away. Vote Palestine will take our demands into the May elections and deliver a message to those seeking office: If you want our votes, stand up for Palestine".
Vote Palestine is involved in more than a dozen campaigns across places like London, Newcastle, Birmingham, Sheffield, and other cities.
In London, every single council seat is up for grabs this May, putting pressure on Labour's big majority in areas like Hackney, where Greens and independents have fully signed the pledge, unlike just a few Labour councillors.

Gazans call for force independent of political factions, say it 'won't succeed without Israel'

Interest is running high among young people in Gaza as the National Committee for the Administration of the Gaza Strip (NCAG) has begun recruiting members for a new police force.
The force is expected to consist of thousands of Palestinian officers who will be trained in Egypt and Jordan, before being deployed in the Gaza Strip, with the task of maintaining order.
One Palestinian told The Jerusalem Post that both his sons applied for positions in the new force, describing their excitement. “On the same day the announcement was published, my children filled out the application form, and they were very enthusiastic about it,” he said. “After it went online, many people were very happy. I can see that there is strong demand for it in Gaza.”
However, he highlighted that for the initiative to succeed, it will require support from Israel. “Without Israeli cooperation, I don’t see how it can really happen,” he said, referring to Israel’s control over the borders and crossings.
“It’s necessary to get the go-ahead from the Israelis and have their help and logistical support. Without it, the police force will not be able to work effectively,” he explained.
Led by Ali Shaath, the Palestinian technocratic committee, NCAG, is set to temporarily govern Gaza and manage civil affairs, including the rebuilding effort, under the oversight of the board of peace. It was officially formed last month, but its members- mostly affiliated with Fatah or linked to the Palestinian Authority- haven't yet entered Gaza to begin work on the ground.
NCAG launches police force recruitment
On Thursday, the committee announced that it was launching recruitment for the future police force, stating, "Despite decades of war, destruction, and suffering, Gaza is home to talented and dedicated Palestinians who are ready to rebuild and serve their community."
The application form stated that candidates must meet certain criteria, such as being a Gaza resident aged 18 to 35. Other conditions required being in good physical shape and having no criminal record.
Another Palestinian from Gaza expressed satisfaction with Nikolay Mladenov's statement that about 2,000 Palestinians have signed up for the police force, and said he expects even more young men to join. “I personally believe this is an excellent move,” he told the Post.
The Gaza resident stressed this force should be free from political affiliation, arguing this is the only way the initiative can truly work.
“I think this police force should not be linked to any of the Palestinian factions- not Hamas, not Fatah," he said. "It has to be independent; that would be more helpful."
However, he added that a solution should be found for the existing officers in Hamas’s police force to prevent them from becoming an obstacle to the functioning of the new police.
“If Hamas leaves the scene, there will be greater opportunities for peace,” he said.
“Yet, perhaps some of the officers currently serving in the Hamas-run police and civil security forces could be incorporated into the new police force,” he suggested. “They need to be reassured in some way so they don’t stand in the way or cause problems.”
Hamas has previously stated that it is willing to transfer authority from its ministries and departments to the new technocratic committee. However, many remain skeptical that the group, which still holds power on the ground, will truly relinquish its control or influence, especially over its security forces.
In recent days, since the start of Ramadan, Hamas police officers have been stationed at intersections and markets in Gaza. They were seen in official uniforms, directing traffic and demonstrating control.
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said the officers were tasked with maintaining order and overseeing commercial activity to ensure merchants do not manipulate prices. “During our activity, we detained ten merchants for price violations," it noted in a statement.
Hamas police in Gaza announced on Saturday that they will continue to monitor markets and take action against those who do not comply with price regulations. “We have begun taking strict measures against those engaging in monopolistic practices,” they said, calling on residents to report cases of price abuse and file complaints at the nearest police station.

- Bookmark
The women's Olympic freeski halfpipe final at the Milan Cortina Games was postponed Saturday because of heavy snow in the Italian Alps.
The International Ski and Snowboard Federation said the snow that has accumulated on the halfpipe made it impossible “to ensure a safe and fair competition for all athletes.”
The federation said officials are working to reschedule the event. The Olympics conclude on Sunday.
The final had been scheduled for 7:30 p.m. local time on Saturday. Officials then pushed that back to 9:00 p.m. before saying it was off.
Snowstorms this week have caused delays and events to be reshuffled twice already in Livigno, where the Olympic freeski and snowboarding events are being held.
The women’s halfpipe final is the final event of the action sports events at the 2026 Games.
The final will feature defending champion Eileen Gu going for her third medal of these Games and her sixth in as many career Olympic events.
The 22-year-old Gu, who was born in the United States and competes for China, has won two silvers in Italy, finishing second in both slopestyle and big air.
Four years ago, Gu became the first freestyle skier to win three medals in a single Olympics after she won gold in halfpipe and big air and silver in slopestyle at the 2022 Beijing Games.
Trying to stop her from repeating as the halfpipe champion will be Amy Fraser of Canada, the only skier to beat Gu in a major contest since she won Olympic gold four years ago. Zoe Atkin, an American-born skier who competes for Britain, is also eyeing the podium after she finished first in Thursday’s qualifying.

'Bibi’s War': The high stakes of Israel's fight against Hamas - opinion

Despite all of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s many accomplishments, which should be recognized and appreciated, the Israel-Hamas War happened on his watch and, therefore, the war to defeat Hamas is on his shoulders, and it will define his legacy.
The war didn’t start with him. however.
It began when the Muslim Brotherhood founded Hamas in 1988, during the First Intifada. Hamas’s primary and immediate goal was to prevent any acceptance of Israel.
That’s why Hamas opposed the Oslo Accords and encouraged Yasser Arafat, chairman of the terrorist Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and head of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to reject offers of statehood. Hamas also launched the Second Intifada, featuring thousands of suicide bombers – considered shahids (“martyrs”), a behavior typical of those who followed its ideology.
The expulsion of Jews from the Gaza Strip and withdrawal of the IDF in 2005 (“Disengagement”) was followed by clashes between the PA/PLO and Hamas in Gaza, which Hamas won, establishing a mini-state under its control.
Supported by Qatar and others, Hamas built a fortress entity with an elaborate tunnel system and, within a few years, had created a formidable army.
By 2012, Hamas was able to attack Israel with missiles, and, although the IDF responded, it did not eliminate the terror group or its military structure.

Israel’s policy was to allow Hamas as an alternative to the PA/PLO. During peaceful periods, many Gazans worked in Israel, and most Israeli leaders believed that Hamas could be convinced to avoid conflicts and build its mini-state.
Without a Commission of Inquiry, it’s difficult to know who to blame for what happened on October 7, 2023. Since Netanyahu was the prime minister, it’s logical to assume that he is mainly responsible for Israeli policy, though many security and military leaders were also responsible for policies and for the way in which Israel conducted its war against Palestinian terrorism.
While wars are terrible, they often define reality and offer clarity. Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, however, is complicated. It’s not only against a military foe, since Hamas also represents a Jihadist ideology that many Muslims share, considering it a “holy war” against all non-Muslims – considered infidels.
Netanyahu’s dilemma in the war in Gaza is that while Israel can contain Hamas as a military force, and hopefully, neutralize and perhaps even defeat it, Hamas has survived. It’s well established in all UNRWA-supported refugee “camps” and works with the PA in Gaza.
Only a matter of time
If Gaza is reconstructed as a Palestinian state, it’s only a matter of time before Hamas returns. If the IDF remains in Gaza, the international community will be furious. The challenge is enormous.
Thinking counterintuitively, Netanyahu’s experience and perspective are unique; his determination and strong personality can provide the leadership that is necessary for stability and to defeat Hamas. His coalition is united and capable. Although many are unhappy with what he does, his critics offer no coherent strategy for ending the war and providing a vision for our future.
Calling this war “Bibi’s War” may be unfair, but it should help us focus on what is at stake. Despite making mistakes, we have also learned from them. The IDF can and must end the war in Gaza decisively. Jews and Jewish communities in the Land of Israel and around the world can and must be protected. These are our priorities; they are essential to Israel’s survival.
The trauma of October 7 remains painful, yet Israeli society seeks to cope with its consequences and to heal. This tests our resolve, our commitment, and our faith. That is what makes this more than just “Bibi’s War.”

Trump sets global tariffs to 15 per cent after Supreme Court ruling

US President Donald Trump has raised global import tariffs to 15 per cent days after the Supreme Court ruled that his earlier levies broke the law.
The move deepens a dispute between the White House and the court and leaves businesses seeking refunds for an estimated $133bn collected under the previous regime.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held that Trump had exceeded his authority by imposing broad tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.
The justices found that the law, designed for national emergencies, did not grant the president power to set taxes. The ruling stated that tariff-setting authority rests with Congress.
The court did not address whether the administration must repay duties already collected.
Within hours of the decision, Trump announced a new 10 per cent global tariff. On Saturday evening, he increased that rate to 15 per cent in a post on Truth Social.
“As President of the United States, I will immediately raise the 10% global tariff to the fully authorised and legally tested 15% level,” Trump wrote. He said many countries had “robbed” the United States for decades.
The White House said the new tariff will take effect at 12.01am on Tuesday 24 February and remain in force for up to 150 days under a provision of the Trade Act of 1974. That law allows the president to impose duties of up to 15 per cent for 150 days, after which Congress must approve any extension.
The administration has excluded goods that were exempt under earlier orders, including passenger vehicles and certain aviation products. Products covered by the existing trade agreement with Canada and Mexico will not face the new duty.
Business groups have called for the immediate reimbursement of the tariffs collected last year following the Supreme Court's ruling.
According to The Guardian, the US Chamber of Commerce urged the administration to return what it estimates to be $133bn in collected tariffs. Chief policy officer Neil Bradley said: “Swift refunds of the impermissible tariffs will be meaningful for the more than 200,000 small business importers in this country and will help support stronger economic growth this year.”
The National Retail Federation, which represents companies from Walmart to small manufacturers, called for “a seamless process to refund the tariffs to US importers”. The group said refunds would allow firms to reinvest in operations, employees and customers.
Trump criticised the court for failing to address refunds. “It’s not discussed,” he said at a press conference in Washington. “We’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”
Trump has directed legal advisers to examine other statutes to support future tariffs. In his Truth Social post, he wrote that his administration would introduce “new and legally authorised tariffs” in the coming months.

Iranian president says Islamic Republic won't yield to international pressure as protests resurface

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated on Saturday that his country would not yield to pressure from global powers during ongoing nuclear talks with the United States.
"World powers are trying to force us into submission... but we will not submit, despite the challenges they are imposing on us," Pezeshkian declared in a speech broadcast live on state TV.
His comments were made amid growing speculation over a potential US strike on Iranian soil, fueled by increasing amounts of naval and air forces being deployed to the region.
On Thursday, US Senator Lindsey Graham said that planning was underway for a possible joint US-Israel attack on Iran. US President Donald Trump later added that the US was considering an initial limited strike on Iran to force Tehran to agree to his demands regarding a deal.
The Jerusalem Post reported on Wednesday that the US is likely to attack Iran eventually, but not necessarily in the coming days.
Protests against Islamic regime resurface on campuses
Meanwhile, protests reportedly resurfaced on Iranian streets as students from several universities across the country rallied against the Islamic regime, Iranian media reported Saturday.
At Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, students gathered on campus chanting "freedom" and "Death to Khamenei," the UK-based Iran International channel reported.
Later reports revealed that the protests at the university escalated into violence, resulting in several students being injured.
"The enemy wants the university to become virtual, but we will not allow it," Sharif University President Masoud Tajrishi was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, students at Amir Kabir University of Technology in Tehran blocked a street near campus and shouted, "Don't be afraid, we are all together."
Clashes were later reported at the university as protesters chanted, "Death to the three corrupt ones: Islamists, leftist, and mojahed," according to Tousi TV.
Videos circulating online showed protesters clashing with security forces on Valiasr Street in Tehran as well.
Reports also indicated a growing protest at Mashhad’s Medical University in northern Iran.
Protesters sentenced to death
Separately, an Iranian court sentenced seven protesters to death earlier this month for their alleged role in setting fire to a military base during the nationwide protests in January, Iran International reported on Friday.
The defendants stated that they were trapped inside the building when it was set ablaze, but the court rejected these claims. The seven men, including a 19-year-old, face charges of arson, collusion against national security, "corruption on earth," and "enmity against God."
Last month, amid ongoing unrest across Iran, Trump issued several warnings to Tehran over the killing of anti-government protesters, vowing to "take very strong action" to prevent such executions.
In a later statement, he said, “The killing has stopped. The executions have stopped. There’s no plan for executions or an execution. I’ve been told that on good authority. We’ll find out about it. I’m sure if it happens, I’ll be very upset.”
'Sharp increase' in arrests of Christians following 12-day war with Israel
Meanwhile, Tehran's crackdown on minority groups has intensified as it faces mounting pressure both domestically and internationally.
A comprehensive report published Thursday by four human rights groups found that there have been nearly twice as many arrests of Christians on charges related to their religious beliefs in 2025 compared to the previous year: 254 compared to 139.
The report, titled "Scapegoating: the 2026 annual report on Rights Violations Against Christians in Iran," was published by Middle East Concern, Article18, Open Doors, and CSW.
The report also noted a “sharp increase” in arrests of Christians following the 12-day war with Israel. The report cited a statement by Iran’s Intelligence Ministry, which recently said that 53 “trained elements” have been “neutralized” since the conflict with Israel, referring to evangelical Christians.
Additionally, Iranian courts have been issuing more severe sentences to Christians. The report noted that in 2024, a total of 96 Christians arrested received a cumulative sentence of 263 years. In 2025, that number spiked, with a total of 73 arrested Christians receiving a cumulative sentence of 280 years, thus conveying a trend towards harsher sentences.
The report urged the international community to hold Iran accountable for its failure to uphold international obligations regarding religious freedom, and to ensure fair and informed asylum procedures for Iranian Christians seeking refuge abroad.

Millions brace for powerful nor’easter with NYC under its first blizzard warning in 9 years
The heaviest snowfall is forecast for Sunday night
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Blizzard warnings have been issued for New York City, New Jersey, and coastal communities along the East Coast, as a late-winter storm poised to arrive on Sunday threatens to severely disrupt the start of the new week.
The National Weather Service significantly upgraded its assessment of the storm's potential severity, having projected a less ferocious impact just days earlier. Forecasters now anticipate between one to two feet (30 and 61 centimetres) of snow in many areas, with blizzard warnings in effect for New York City, Long Island, southern Connecticut, and coastal regions of New Jersey and Delaware. Flooding is also a possibility in parts of New York and New Jersey.
The storm is expected to begin quietly on Sunday, potentially with rainfall in some locations, before intensifying. The heaviest snowfall is forecast for Sunday night, with some areas experiencing up to 5 centimetres (two inches) of snow per hour, before tapering off by Monday afternoon.
The weather service warned that steady winds of between 40 and 56 kilometres per hour (25-35 mph) would "make travel dangerous, if not impossible," adding that "scattered downed tree limbs and power outages possible due to snow load and strong winds."
This impending weather event arrives just as the icy remnants of a snowstorm that struck the region weeks prior were finally melting away.
“Snow starts Sunday morning, intensifies at night, and will make the Monday morning commute extremely dangerous. Stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary. If you can stay home, stay home,” New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said on X.

Why the future of Gaza will be decided in mosques - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-21
17:17:25 UTC
02:17:25 KST

Ahead of the month of Ramadan, three new mosques were inaugurated in northern Gaza, funded by a Turkish religious foundation, with Turkish flags flying prominently on their façades. One of the mosques is named after Abdullah Azzam, one of the spiritual fathers of al-Qaeda. This is not merely an innocent reconstruction project: it is an ideological declaration of intent.
For years, Israel has opposed any Qatari or Turkish military presence in the Gaza Strip. Yet even without tanks and soldiers, Doha and Ankara operate in Gaza with significant influence, providing food, shelter, infrastructure, and mosques. States that openly support Hamas and host its senior leaders understand well that real influence does not begin on the battlefield, but in consciousness.
And consciousness is shaped in mosques and schools.
The greatest mistake of the international community in recent decades has been its exclusive focus on the security or economic dimension: another round, another arrangement, another flow of funds. But without deep de-radicalization – a fundamental transformation of values and messages – nothing will truly change.
Terrorists as heroes
One cannot build a stable reality when a child in Gaza learns to admire terrorists as “heroes,” consumes content that glorifies shahids, and listens to sermons preaching war against infidels. This is a systematic incitement industry that produces generation after generation of terrorists.
Therefore, the “day after” in Gaza cannot be limited to “reconstruction” – it must come together with de-radicalization and a transformation of consciousness.
The next generation in Gaza must grow up differently, and that begins with education. A serious international plan for the future of the region must include close supervision of educational content and mosque sermons, the appointment of moderate imams, and clear enforcement against incitement. Such oversight exists in dozens of Arab states, out of an understanding by their governments of the weight sermons carry for their stability.
The most prominent regional example is the United Arab Emirates (UAE). At the Abrahamic Family House campus in Abu Dhabi a mosque, a church, and a synagogue stand side by side among the most magnificent in the Mediterranean sphere – a symbol of a deliberate policy of religious tolerance and coexistence.
During my visit to the complex, I was told that when the original construction plan was presented, one that did not include a synagogue, the late president Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan remarked that it was inconceivable not to give expression to the ancient and wisdom-rich Jewish faith, and that we must rise above political disputes in order to exist together in the region.
Governmental oversight of mosques
The symbolism of the campus is also reflected in concrete policy steps: There is governmental oversight over Friday sermons – approved texts, supervised appointments, and training geared toward messages of coexistence.
In contrast, under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has adopted a hostile and dangerous ideological line toward Israel and has fostered a militant pan-Islamic consciousness.
Erdogan’s conception of the education system is neither neutral nor merely pedagogical: it is strategic.
In recent years, there has been significant radicalization in textbooks, and the curriculum has undergone clear ideological radicalization. Within this framework, the concept of “jihad war” has been introduced into textbooks and presented as a central value, martyrdom (shahada) in battle is portrayed as commendable, and struggle and combat are presented as an essential part of Islamic and national identity.
Islam is no longer presented merely as a religion, but as a political project. The West – and especially Israel – is portrayed as a colonial occupying force, and there is even understanding shown for the motives of organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda. Zionism is depicted in demonic terms, and Christians and Jews are referred to as “infidels” rather than Ahl al-Kitab (People of the Book).
Turkey is not neutral
In arenas such as Gaza, where a struggle is underway over shaping the next generation, such a model is geopolitical. Mosques bearing the Turkish flag in Gaza are not neutral; they symbolize an attempt to shape the religious and political space in the spirit of Ankara. The future of the Strip cannot be entrusted to those who grant political legitimacy to Hamas and frame the conflict as a comprehensive religious struggle.
Indeed, a de-radicalization plan does not produce immediate results; its fruits will be seen only in the next generation. But we have already wasted an entire generation since the Oslo Accords, in which we relinquished control and assumed that economic incentives would suffice. If before Oslo Israelis could travel by bus to Gaza via the central bus station in Beersheba, today that reality seems imaginary. This is the depth of the shift in consciousness that has occurred there within just one generation.
Can the wheel be turned back? Perhaps not fully – but we do not have the privilege of not trying.
Anyone seeking a stable future for Gaza, for the sake of the Palestinians themselves and for Israel’s security, must understand: Without oversight of sermons, without rebuilding educational curricula – and without replacing the infrastructure of incitement with an infrastructure of life, peace, and prosperity – any physical reconstruction will be a building on sand.
The battle over tomorrow’s Gaza will not be decided only at borders and crossings. It will be decided by the question of who drafts the Friday sermon.

Trump raises US global tariff rate to 15%

02:11:01 KST

President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15 percent level."
The US leader had announced an initial 10 percent duty in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling.
And Trump added that over the next few months, his administration would seek further alternative ways to impose "legally permissible" tariffs.
Saturday's announcement is the latest in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.
It also appears on its face to be an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's latest ruling, which offered perhaps the firmest rebuke yet of the Republican leader's sweeping and often arbitrary duties, his signature international trade policy.
Cajoling and punishing countries
The new duty by law is only temporary -- allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.
Trump spent much of the past year imposing various rates to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.
On Friday, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.
The conservative-majority high court ruled six to three on Friday that a 1977 law Trump has relied on to slap sudden rates on individual countries, upending global trade, "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."
Trump, who had nominated two of the justices who repudiated him, responded furiously, alleging without evidence that the court was influenced by foreign interests.
"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump told reporters.

Child among 3 Palestinians injured by illegal Israeli settlers’ assaults in West Bank
2 people were shot in village near Ramallah and another was beaten in Masafer Yatta, say ocal officials and medics
RAMALLAH, Palestine
Three Palestinians, including a child, were wounded Saturday by illegal Israeli settlers in two separate attacks in the occupied West Bank, local officials and medics said.
In the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah, village council head Amin Abu Alia told Anadolu that illegal settlers opened fire on residents, wounding two Palestinians.
“The situation is bad. Gunfire is ongoing on the southern side of the village. There are two injuries—a child and a young man who was shot in the back and is in critical condition,” Abu Alia said.
In a separate incident in the southern West Bank, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said a Palestinian man was injured after being beaten by illegal settlers in the Masafer Yatta area, south of Hebron.
Israeli army forces obstructed its medical crews while they were attempting to provide assistance, the organization added.
Violence in the West Bank has escalated since the outbreak of the Gaza genocide in October 2023, which lasted two years and included widespread killing, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion.
According to Palestinian official data, the violence has resulted in the deaths of 1,116 Palestinians and injuries to around 11,500 others, in addition to the arrest of nearly 22,000 people across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

FIFA's Infantino to face no IOC action on Olympic neutrality rules over Trump peace board
The International Olympic Committee will take no action against its member Gianni Infantino for a possible breach of political neutrality rules over aligning FIFA with U.S. President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
The IOC said Saturday the matter is closed and FIFA's development work in Gaza is “entirely in keeping with the role of an international sport federation.”
Trump hosted the peace board event Thursday in Washington, D.C., where Infantino signed an agreement on behalf of the soccer governing body that could see $75 million of its funds invested in Gaza.
Asked Friday about Infantino's conduct, IOC President Kirsty Coventry said it would look into a possible breach of neutrality. The Olympic members' oath requires “to always act independently of … political interests.”
Coventry and Infantino are among 107 current invited members of the IOC who include sports leaders, former Olympic athletes, members of Asian and European royal families, former political leaders and diplomats, plus business and cultural figures.
The IOC membership meets Sunday morning in Milan and will welcome two new athlete members elected at the Winter Games.
Attendance is not mandatory and it was unclear if Infantino will return after spending several days in the city for IOC meetings ahead of the Feb. 6 opening ceremony.

Google's AI boss calls for more research on threats posed by AI
AI being exploited by malicious users and humans eventually losing control of systems as they become more capable, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says
ISTANBUL
The CEO of Google DeepMind has called for more research into the threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI) "to be done urgently."
Demis Hassabis said the sector desired "smart regulation" for "the real risks" caused by the tech, BBC reported on Friday.
His remarks came during an exclusive interview at the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, India's capital, where the India AI Impact Summit 2026 concluded.
Demis said it was crucial to put strong safeguards in place to protect against the gravest dangers posed by increasingly autonomous systems.
He highlighted the two major risks of AI being exploited by malicious users and humans eventually losing control of systems as they become more capable.
Asked if he could slow development to give specialists more time to address these issues, he said his company could contribute but stressed it was just one participant among many in the wider AI landscape.
He also acknowledged that regulators are struggling to match the speed of AI progress.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman likewise urged swift regulation at the AI Summit, and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said nations must cooperate to ensure AI delivers benefits.
The US, however, pushed back, with delegation leader Michael Kratsios saying the Trump administration is firmly opposed to global AI governance.

His announcement followed remarks on Friday in which he criticized the court’s “deeply disappointing” decision to invalidate the “emergency” tariffs he had implemented worldwide.

Philippa Sigl-Glockner, who once served as private secretary to former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has been mentioned in documents linked to convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The publicly released documents reveal references to Sigl-Glockner, who was Scholz’s private secretary while he served as Germany’s finance minister.
One redacted message to Epstein reportedly states: "You may also remember one of my wonderful young staff members. Philippa completed her master’s degree in computer science, joined the super-elite German intelligence service, and was assigned to the ministry of finance to track money flows."
Another document shows that information from Sigl-Glockner’s work on African telecommunications systems was passed on to Epstein.
Sigl-Glockner, now president of the European Macro Policy Network (EMPN), held her role as Scholz’s private secretary from May 2019 to Nov. 2020.
Scholz later served as Germany’s chancellor from 2021 to 2025.
On Jan. 30, the US Justice Department released more than 3 million pages of documents, 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which was signed into law last November.
Those materials include grand jury transcripts and investigative records, though many pages remain heavily redacted. Epstein survivors and victims’ relatives say the disclosure falls short of what the law requires and omits vital information.
Authorities found Epstein dead by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls.

Trump raises tariffs to 15% on imports from all countries

Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he would raise a temporary tariff rate on US imports from all countries from 10% to 15%, less than 24 hours after the US supreme court ruled against the legality of his flagship trade policy.
Infuriated by the high court’s ruling on Friday that he had exceeded his authority and should have gotten congressional approval for the tariffs, the US president railed against the justices who blocked his use of tariffs, calling them a “disgrace to the nation”, and ordered an immediate 10% tariff on all imports, in addition to any existing levies.
In a post on Truth Social on Saturday announcing the further increase, Trump wrote: “I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
The law according to section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to impose a levy of up to 15% for 150 days, although it could face legal challenges. During that period, his administration will work on issuing new and “legally permissible” tariffs, Trump said.
The president also attacked the supreme court’s 6-3 ruling as “ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American” in his Truth Social post.
In remarks at the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters: “It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think.” He added: “I’m ashamed of certain members of the court. Absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country.”
He praised the three justices who dissented in the opinion: Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote the main dissent, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. The others – including two of his appointees, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch – drew his derision.
“They’re just being fools and lapdogs for the Rinos [“Republicans in name only”] and the radical-left Democrats, and not that they should have anything at all to do with it,” Trump said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution.”
He called Barrett and Gorsuch “an embarrassment to their families” and said they were “barely” invited to the State of the Union address next week.
Asked for evidence of foreign influence over the supreme court, Trump replied: “You’re going to find out.”

Germany will approach Donald Trump on tariffs with a unified European front, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Saturday, after the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a blow to the U.S. president’s sweeping duties.
“I will go to Washington with a coordinated European position,” Merz told German broadcaster ARD following the CDU party conference in Stuttgart, stressing that tariff policy is a matter for the European Union, not individual member states.
Merz is due to meet with Trump in early March as European capitals assess the implications of the U.S. high court's ruling for transatlantic trade. French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday warned against complacency after Trump swiftly imposed new duties following the court ruling.

Pakistan-New Zealand Super Eights opener abandoned at T20 World Cup
Persistent rain in Colombo forces abandonment of Pakistan’s game with New Zealand, which was to open Super Eights stage.
Pakistan and New Zealand’s Super Eights match to open the second phase of the 2026 T20 World Cup was abandoned because of rain without a ball being bowled.
The rain started at Colombo’s R Premadasa Stadium as soon as Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha won the toss and chose to bat first on Saturday.

Ukrainian drone forces strike oil depot in Crimea
According to Ukrinform, USF reported this on Facebook and shared video footage of the operation.
“Operators of the 1st Separate Unmanned Systems Center, in coordination with the Deep Strike Center of the USF, struck an oil depot in the settlement of Hvardiiske – a facility that supplies fuel to Russian troops on the peninsula,” the statement reads.
Damage to the facility has caused fuel supply disruptions, reducing the mobility of Russian forces and complicating the use of Crimea as a logistics hub.
The Unmanned Systems Forces are systematically targeting and degrading the organizational structure of the Russian military.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, on February 21, the UAV forces destroyed a Russian Tornado-S multiple rocket launcher in the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia region.

Trump hikes US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 per cent on Feb 21, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy
Mr Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Feb 20’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme
The US leader had announced an initial 10 per cent duty in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling.
And Mr Trump added that over the next few months, his administration would seek further alternative ways to impose “legally permissible” tariffs.
Feb 21’s announcement is the latest in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Mr Trump’s team over the past year.
It also appears on its face to be an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court’s latest ruling, which offered perhaps the firmest rebuke yet of the Republican leader’s sweeping and often arbitrary duties, his signature international trade policy.
The new duty by law is only temporary – allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.
Mr Trump spent much of the past year imposing various rates to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.
On Feb 20, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Mr Trump’s administration would also face the new global tariff.
The conservative-majority high court ruled six to three on Feb 20 that a 1977 law Mr Trump has relied on to slap sudden rates on individual countries, upending global trade, “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs.”
Mr Trump, who had nominated two of the justices who repudiated him, responded furiously, alleging without evidence that the court was influenced by foreign interests.
“I’m ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” Mr Trump told reporters. AFP

Jordan, Venezuela agree on roadmap for economic cooperation
Jordan’s foreign minister pays working visit to Caracas
AMMAN, Jordan
Jordan and Venezuela have agreed to develop a roadmap identifying available and promising areas of economic cooperation, while also reviewing regional and international issues of mutual interest.
The agreement came during separate meetings between Jordan’s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi and Venezuela’s Acting President Delcy Rodríguez, as well as Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, during an undeclared working visit by Safadi to the capital, Caracas.
According to a statement issued Saturday by Jordan’s Foreign Ministry, Rodríguez received Safadi on Friday, during which he conveyed King Abdullah II’s keenness to further develop relations between the two countries.
Rodríguez, in turn, affirmed Venezuela’s interest in strengthening bilateral ties across various fields, the statement said.
The discussions also addressed opportunities to enhance cooperation in several economic sectors, in addition to regional and international issues of common concern.
Safadi later held expanded talks with his Venezuelan counterpart Yvan Gil on ways to boost cooperation in key sectors including energy, oil and gas, tourism, culture, trade and investment, according to the statement.
The two ministers also discussed regional and international developments and stressed the importance of joint efforts to promote regional and global security and stability.
Safadi and Gil agreed to develop a clear roadmap identifying priority economic sectors, mechanisms for cooperation and steps to expedite the signing of necessary bilateral agreements to advance relations.
They also agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding on political consultations to institutionalize regular meetings aimed at strengthening friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
Jordan’s Foreign Ministry announced Friday evening that Safadi had arrived in Caracas for a working visit.

Illegal Israeli settler attacks force displacement of 11 Palestinian families east of Ramallah
Families, comprising 55 people, including children, the elderly, and women, have begun moving to area near Jericho, says resident
RAMALLAH, Palestine
Eleven Palestinian families on Saturday began dismantling their homes in a Bedouin community east of the city of Ramallah in the central occupied West Bank due to continued attacks by illegal Israeli settlers and the Israeli army.
Mustafa Kaabneh, a resident of the Khalayel Bedouin encampment south of the village of al-Mughayyir, told Anadolu that 11 families in the community started dismantling their makeshift homes of tin sheets and tents early Saturday in preparation to relocate to another area, amid continuous attacks by Israeli forces and illegal settlers.
He said the families, comprising 55 people including children, the elderly, and women, have begun moving to an area near Jericho as a result of the assaults and restrictions imposed by settlers and the Israeli army.
Kaabneh explained that residents of the community “were displaced two years ago from the Ein Samiya community in the neighboring village of Kafr Malik under pressure and attacks by the army and settlers, who later pursued them to the community where they currently live.”
He added that settlers prevent sheep grazing and carry out daily attacks and threats and have established a settlement outpost adjacent to the community, while the army has confiscated vehicles and detained a number of residents.
According to data from the Palestinian Authority’s Colonization & Wall Resistance Commission, illegal Israeli settlers carried out approximately 4,723 attacks across the West Bank in 2025, killing 14 Palestinians and displacing 13 Bedouin communities comprising 1,090 people.
Palestinian official reports indicate that by the end of 2024, the number of Israeli settlers in the West Bank had reached about 770,000, living in more than 180 settlements and 256 settlement outposts.

‘Post’ looks on as India showcases naval strength with Int’l Fleet Review
Unknown

VISAKHAPATNAM — India on Wednesday placed its expanding naval power on full display as it formally opened the International Fleet Review (IFR) 2026 off the coast of Visakhapatnam (Vizag), which The Jerusalem Post attended. The review marked the launching of a sequence of major maritime events that will bring more than 100 countries into contact with the Indian Navy over the coming weeks.
The fleet review, hosted by India’s Eastern Naval Command in the Bay of Bengal, was the first of three high-profile gatherings, followed by the multilateral MILAN 2026 naval exercise. The Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) Conclave of Chiefs also took place on Friday. The events are a show of India’s ambition to position itself as a central maritime power in the Indo-Pacific at a time of growing strategic competition and security challenges at sea.
Presiding over the ceremonial review, which took place with the participation of 74 countries, was India’s President Droupadi Murmu, acting in her constitutional role as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The event was also attended by Nara Chandrababu Naidu, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh (the state in which Visakhapatnam resides), and Admiral Dinesh K. Tripathi, Chief of the Naval Staff of India.
From offshore waters outside Visakhapatnam’s port, Murmu reviewed formations of Indian naval vessels alongside ships and aircraft from 21 foreign navies, proof of India’s expanding web of maritime partnerships. The Post accompanied the review on a ship just behind the president’s.
Participating countries in this year’s review included Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Seychelles, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Vietnam, France, and Germany.
The International Fleet Review was primarily ceremonial in nature, intended to project goodwill and mutual respect among participating navies, with search and rescue drills and maritime manoeuvres on show for the president.
Indian officials emphasized, however, that the symbolism carries strategic weight. With nearly 100 vessels across the three events - including aircraft carriers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, patrol vessels, amphibious platforms, and naval aviation assets - the scale of participation was confirmation of India’s growing convening power in the maritime domain.
India's push for naval self-reliance
India last hosted an International Fleet Review in Visakhapatnam in 2016, and previously in Mumbai in 2001. A decade on, the return of the event to the eastern seaboard highlights how significantly India’s naval posture has evolved. Over recent years, New Delhi has accelerated efforts to strengthen its maritime capabilities, driven by concerns over China’s expanding presence across the Indian Ocean and South Asian waters, as well as the enduring rivalry with Pakistan.
That evolution was clearly visible in the fleet deployed for review. At the center stood the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, the first carrier designed and built domestically, which has become a symbol of India’s push toward naval self-reliance. Commissioned in 2022, the Vikrant, which the Post spent time aboard, is a major milestone in indigenous shipbuilding for the subcontinental nation and is now a key component of India’s carrier battle group operations.
Alongside the Vikrant were several newer classes of Indian-built warships, including Visakhapatnam-class guided-missile destroyers, Nilgiri-class Project 17A frigates, and Arnala-class anti-submarine corvettes. Subsurface capabilities were also on display, with submarines from the Shindughosh class operating as part of the broader formation. Naval aviation elements included formations of MiG-29K fighter aircraft embarked on carrier operations.
Indian officials have repeatedly linked this modernization drive to a broader national strategy aimed at achieving defense self-sufficiency. The push for indigenous platforms forms part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s long-term vision of a “self-reliant” and “resilient” India, with 2047, the year that marks the centenary of Indian independence, set as a symbolic target date for reducing dependence on foreign suppliers.
Challenges still remain for the Indians, particularly for the navy. India’s fleet still relies on a diverse mix of Russian, Israeli, French, Italian, and Indian systems, which creates logistical and maintenance hurdles. Maintaining operational readiness while managing this vast, diverse fleet remains a major task for the future of the navy.
Beyond the ships themselves, Indian leaders have showcased the fleet review and accompanying exercises as part of their wider effort to increase maritime cooperation.
Speaking at related events in Visakhapatnam, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called on the international community to confront “complex and interconnected maritime challenges” through cooperation, telling those gathered that no single navy can address issues such as piracy, terrorism, illegal fishing, cyber vulnerabilities, or disruptions to global supply chains alone.
“When our ships sail together, when our sailors train together, and when our commanders deliberate together, we build a shared understanding that transcends geography and politics,” Singh said.
With the MILAN 2026 exercises taking place until February 26, India’s eastern seaboard has, for the next few days, become a focal point for naval diplomacy in the Indo-Pacific, all of which signals New Delhi’s continuing intent to act as a major force in global maritime affairs.

Trump to raise new worldwide tariff to 15 per cent on all countries

Trump to raise new worldwide tariff to 15 per cent after Supreme Court loss
Updated ,first published
Washington: US President Donald Trump says he will raise his new global tariff to 15 per cent, just a day after ordering a 10 per cent worldwide tariff, following the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down his previous system of “reciprocal” import duties.
Trump announced on social media on Saturday (Washington time) that “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday”, he would lift the new tariffs to 15 per cent, effective immediately.
The new tariff is due to begin on Tuesday (Washington time), and lasts for 150 days. It replaces the old system under which imports from Australia had a 10 per cent tariff - effectively the lowest of any country.
Trump’s post on Truth Social did not indicate any exemptions for countries with which the US enjoys a trade surplus, such as Australia. He said the 15 per cent rate would apply to countries worldwide, “many of which have been ‘ripping’ the US off for decades, without retribution”.
He added: “During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again - GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!!! Thank you for your attention to this matter.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for more information.
The move comes a day after Trump raged at the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down his previous system of so-called reciprocal tariffs applied at differing rates using presidential emergency powers.
Trump exceeded his authority as president by doing so, the majority ruled in a 6-3 verdict, as “Congress alone” has the power to raise revenue by imposing permanent tariffs.
The new tariffs use a different mechanism - Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 - which allows the president to impose tariffs of up to 15 per cent for 150 days to address urgent balance-of-payments concerns.
Recent Commerce Department data showed the US ran a trade deficit of about $US900 billion ($1.27b) last year.
After 150 days, the new tariff would have to be extended by Congress. Trump has also instructed the Office of the US Trade Representative to begin formal trade practices investigations, with a view to expanding sectoral tariffs on certain products, such as steel and aluminium.
Those were unaffected by the Supreme Court ruling, which only examined the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed via emergency powers.
On Friday, Trump called a snap news conference following the court’s verdict, where he criticised the court’s “terrible” and “deeply disappointing” decision, which he also claimed was “defective” and legally incorrect.
The president was particularly scornful of the two justices he appointed in his first term who ruled against the tariffs, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he accused of disloyalty. Trump continued to rage on Truth Social, his social media platform, later in the day.
“What happened today with [Gorsuch and Barrett], whether people like it or not, never seems to happen with Democrats,” he posted. “They vote against the Republicans, and never against themselves, almost every single time, no matter how good a case we have.”
Trump heaped praise on Brett Kavanaugh, his 2018 appointment to the bench, who dissented from the majority opinion along with conservative justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.
The court’s verdict has also prompted calls for billions of dollars in tariff revenue to be returned to corporate America and small business importers who bore the brunt of the cost. The US Chamber of Commerce was among the business groups calling for “swift refunds” on Friday.
But Trump said the matter would likely have to be litigated in court, potentially for years, and chided the Supreme Court for not issuing a ruling on refunds.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, asked in an interview about the fight for $US175 billion in improperly collected revenue, said bluntly: “I get a feeling the American people won’t see it.”

Gisèle Pelicot says trial was for all sexual violence survivors and women who gathered at court ‘gave her strength’
The feminist hero who changed the world for sexual offence survivors with her calls for shame to change sides speaks at the UK launch of her powerful new memoir A Hymn to Life
- Bookmark
Gisèle Pelicot has said her trial was for all sexual violence survivors as she opened up about the women gathered at court who “gave her strength” in a moving conversation.
The 73-year-old was speaking at the UK launch of her powerful memoir, A Hymn to Life, which details the harrowing ordeal she suffered after discovering her then-husband drugged then raped her while unconscious, along with dozens of men he had recruited online.
In the book, written with journalist Judith Perrignon, Ms Pelicot opens up about the moment she decided to waive her anonymity and have a public trial, paving the way for France’s most shocking mass rape case, and changing the world for sexual offence survivors with her calls for shame to change sides.
Speaking at the Southbank Centre in London on Friday, Ms Pelicot said the women who gathered in greater and greater numbers outside the courthouse in Avignon throughout the trial help her find the strength to endure its duration, after initially only planning to stay for two weeks of the three months.
“It gave me an enormous amount of strength,” she said. “I had to stay there, we were really connected.”
She revealed that she did not read the news at all during that period, and has not really since, but instead chose to end each harrowing day at court by reading the letters sent to her from women around the globe who shared their stories of survival.
“This actually gave me strength,” she said. “It wasn’t just my own trial, but a trial for all these women who went through sexual violence.”
The event, chaired by Ms Ahmed, included moving readings from the new book, which went on sale on Tuesday, by actors Juliet Stevenson, Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Kate Winslet.
In her memoir, Ms Pelicot recalls the moment her “brain shut down” as police told her what her then-husband Dominique Pelicot and the 50 other attackers had done to her. The men were jailed for a total of 428 years in 2024 after 47 of them were found guilty of rape, two were found guilty of attempted rape, and two were found guilty of sexual assault.
Ms Ahmed and Ms Pelicot discussed the around 20 further attackers that investigations suggested are yet to be identified, on top of the 51 men who were convicted.
Asked if there is hope of finding them, Ms Pelicot said: “No, I don’t think so. Sometimes I fear these individuals could continue committing crimes. Maybe they’ll be caught one day. But unfortunately, I don’t know. Maybe life will give a helping hand to arrest these individuals one day.”
Ms Pelicot referred to the trial of the 51 men who were found as “the trial of cowardice” because “none of them admitted they’d done anything wrong”.
She also expressed her sympathy for the families of the perpetrators whose “lives are shattered forever”. “There was not just one victim, there were 51 victims,” she said.
She opened up about how the horrific ordeal her own family had been put through had “really pushed us apart”. She said: “This trauma didn’t bring us together. It’s not true that trauma necessarily brings family together.”
Speaking of how she has tried to make sense of how her supposedly loving husband of 50 years could do what he did to her, Ms Pelicot described him in similar terms to how psychologists did during the trial: “As a man split in two.”
“I tried to bring him into the light, but he has this dark side,” she said. “It’s intolerable. It’s unacceptable. This shattered our family, our lives were absolutely shattered.”
There is a brief moment in the book when she writes of the moment she considered “ending it all”. But she said on Friday: “This was only a momentary thought. I thought no. I have to continue. It was important to face up to reality. I had some sort of strength inside.”
It is this remarkable ability of Ms Pelicot to find extraordinary strength and courage during even the worst of times that she wants to leave us with.
She told the audience: “Above all, this book is a message of hope. Look at what I’ve gone through, I’m still here. We can go through difficult times. We can get through. I want to, above all, put forward a message of hope.”
She ended by revealing that her plans for the future are simply to live “serenely”. But she added: “I’ll always listen to women who need support. I’ll always be here.”

Divers recover bodies of seven Chinese tourists from bottom of Lake Baikal
Russian authorities say divers have recovered the bodies of seven Chinese tourists and a Russian driver who died after their mini-bus plunged under the ice to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia.
Irkutsk regional Governor Igor Kobzev offered his "deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims". He earlier said one Chinese tourist had managed to escape.
The depth at the site of Friday's accident was 18m (59ft), and the divers had to use underwater cameras to search for the bodies.
Baikal - the world's deepest lake with a maximum depth of 1,642m (5,387ft) - is a popular tourist destination. It often freezes during harsh winters and has seen a number of deadly accidents over the years.
The bus fell into three-metre-wide ice fissure on Friday, Kobzev said in a post on Telegram.
"I would like to remind you once again that going out onto Lake Baikal's ice is not just prohibited right now. It's mortally dangerous," the governor said, urging tourists to use only official tour operators.
He added that all the Chinese tourists - including a 14-year-old child - had travelled independently.
A criminal investigation into the cause of the tragedy is now under way.
Shortly afterwards Kobzev took to social media again, saying that "sadly, even this tragedy hasn't taught people a lesson", informing that six people trapped in their cars had been rescued in two separate incidents on Friday and Saturday.
In late January, a Chinese tourist died after a car he was travelling overturned on the frozen surface of Lake Baikal.

Mass rally in support of Ukraine held in Prague
That is reported by an Ukrinform correspondent.
Several thousand people gathered at Old Town Square, waving Czech and Ukrainian flags and holding posters.
Participants include President Petr Pavel, Czech politicians, and the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, Vasyl Zvarych.
President Pavel thanked his compatriots for supporting Ukraine, emphasizing that this is not someone else’s war – it affects the Czech Republic as well.
“The war could end immediately if one person – Vladimir Putin – decides to stop it,” the President stressed, urging people not to forget who started the conflict.
Organizers said the rally was meant to clearly signal that citizens of the Czech Republic continue to stand with Ukraine and that this stance has not changed despite changes in government.
“In a time when political signals from the Czech Republic and the world are becoming blurred, when the aggressor’s guilt is being relativized, and populism and cynicism are on the rise, we want to loudly tell the world that: the conditions of peace are decided not by the aggressor or by great powers, but by Ukrainian men and women; that the end of the war should not mean the end of a free Ukraine. We want peace, we want a united Europe, we want security for ourselves and for Ukraine,” the organizers said.
The organizers emphasized that Czech society has repeatedly demonstrated that it understands the stakes of this war – for freedom, security, and Europe’s future – and it is important to continue reminding people of this.
On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, support rallies for Ukraine are being held in many countries.

- Trump expressed strong disappointment with the 6-3 Supreme Court decision, criticizing Republican appointees for not supporting his policy.
- He stated his administration would now utilize the 1974 Trade Act to implement the new tariffs.
- The 1974 Trade Act permits a maximum tariff of 15 per cent for a period of 150 days, unless extended by a congressional vote.

US trade war: Trump raises global tariffs to 15% from 10%
Published February 21, 2026last updated February 21, 2026What you need to know
- Trump raises global tariff from 10% to 15%
- US president raises tariff following Supreme Court ruling
- US top court struck down much of Trump's emergency tariffs enacted under a law used in national emergencies
- The US president's ability to impose tariffs using other laws not affected by Friday's ruling
- Germany's Merz to travel to Washington, due to meet Trump early March
Here is a roundup of the news concerning the US tariff turmoil on Saturday, February 21:
Germany's Merz to travel to Washington amid tariff turmoil
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told German public broadcaster ARD that he will be traveling to Washington with a "coordinated European position."
His comments came before US President Donald Trump raised global tariffs to 15% on Saturday.
The German chancellor was speaking with German media outlets after a party conference in Stuttgart came to a close.
He told German broadcaster RTL that "constant uncertainty" on tariffs was "the biggest poison for the economies in Europe and the US."
"This uncertainty needs to end," he told the private television network. "And I will make an effort to do so."
Trump calls Supreme Court tariff 'extraordinarily anti-American'
In a post published on his Truth Social network, US President Donald Trump said the Supreme Court decision to strike down tariffs was "ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American."
He said his decision to raise new tariffs from 10% to 15% was "fully allowed, and legally tested."
"During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again — GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!!!" he added.
Trump introduced his controversial import charges under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). In their Friday decision, however, the justices at the top US court stated that the law "does not authorize the president to impose tariffs" and that this power was reserved for lawmakers.
The US president quickly responded by announcing a 10% global tariff under a different law.
Trump invoked Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 as the legal basis for his decision. The new levies can take effect for 150 days before the duties require approval from US Congress.
Donald Trump raises tariffs to 15%
After the Supreme Court struck down most of President Donald Trump's controversial trade tariffs as unconstitutional, he announced new levies of 15% worldwide.
The move would be "effective immediately," Trump said in a social media post.
Trump also said many of the countries affected had been "ripping" the US off for decades "without retribution (until I came along!)" without providing details.
The financial fallout of his decision and the effects on it for US trading partners were not immediately clear.

Iran students chant anti-government slogans, as US threats loom

Iranian students chant anti-government slogans, as US threats loom
Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans and scuffled with counter-protesters on Saturday in the latest display of anger at the country's clerical leaders, who also face a US military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal.
The gatherings at universities, which were reported by both local and diaspora media outlets, followed a mass protest movement that was met with a government crackdown last month that left thousands dead.
The crackdown had prompted US President Donald Trump to threaten to intervene militarily, though the focus of his threats eventually shifted to Iran's nuclear programme, which Western governments fear is aimed at producing a bomb.
The US and Iran recently resumed Oman-mediated talks aimed at securing a deal, but Washington has simultaneously increased its military presence in the region, dispatching two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to back its warnings.
Videos geolocated by AFP news agency to Tehran's top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd on Saturday as people shouted "bi sharaf", or "disgraceful" in Farsi.
Footage posted by the Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
Iranians had reprised their protest slogans earlier this week to mark the 40th day since thousands of people were killed as a wave of demonstrations was peaking on January 8 and 9.
They gathered again at several universities in the capital on Saturday, local media reported.
The unrest first broke out in December over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government demonstrations that were suppressed in a violent crackdown by security forces.
The clerical authorities acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by "terrorist acts" fuelled by Iran's enemies.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), however, has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.
Iranian authorities had initially acknowledged the legitimacy of the protesters' economic demands, but as the movement took on an overtly anti-government tone, they accused archenemies the United States and Israel of whipping up "riots".
Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a "silent and peaceful sit-in" on Saturday of students commemorating those killed was disrupted by people chanting slogans including "death to the dictator" -- a reference to Iran's supreme leader.
A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits.
Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.
Talks and threats
Ever since the initial wave of protests, the United States and Iran have been trading threats of military action.
Trump sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to the region, accompanied by a flotilla of 12 support ships, while a second carrier group attached to the USS Gerald R Ford is en route to the area via the Mediterranean.
The US has also redeployed dozens of other warplanes to the Middle East -- where it maintains several bases -- while boosting its land-based air defences.
The build-up is aimed at pressuring Iran's authorities to cut a deal on the country's nuclear programme, even as the two sides have pursued talks on the subject.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media this week that following the latest round of negotiations in Geneva, Iran would be submitting a draft proposal for an agreement, saying "in the next two, three days, that would be ready".
Araghchi also said the "US side has not asked for zero enrichment" of uranium, contradicting statements from American officials.
Trump had suggested on Thursday that "bad things" would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, a period which he subsequently extended to 15.
Iran denies it is trying to produce nuclear weapons and says its programme is peaceful, but insists on its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes.
The US media outlet Axios reported this week, citing an unnamed senior US official, that the US was prepared to consider a proposed deal that only permitted "small, token enrichment".
A previous round of nuclear diplomacy between the US and Iran last year was interrupted by Israel's surprise bombing campaign against the Islamic republic.
The United States ultimately joined its ally, striking key nuclear facilities before declaring a ceasefire.

Over 1,000 UK councilors pledge support for Palestine ahead of May local elections

Over 1,000 UK councilors pledge support for Palestine ahead of May local elections
Councilors sign pledge to divest pension funds and take stand on Palestinian rights
LONDON
More than 1,000 councilors across England have pledged their support for Palestinian rights ahead of the crucial local elections in May, as campaigners aim to make Palestine a central electoral issue.
The Councillor Pledge for Palestine, launched by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) in December and backed by the Vote Palestine 2026 coalition, commits elected representatives to act to uphold Palestinian rights and ensure their councils are not complicit in Israel’s violations of international law.
Measures include divesting council pension funds from companies implicated in these violations.
Thirty-one councils have already passed motions or issued statements supporting pension fund divestment, a position backed by 46% of voters and opposed by just 14%, according to data by PSC.
"The mass movement for Palestine – which has brought millions onto Britain’s streets – is not going away. Vote Palestine will take our demands into the May elections and deliver a message to those seeking office: if you want our votes, stand up for Palestine," Dan Iley-Williamson, political organizer at PSC, said in a statement on Saturday.
Of the 1,028 councilors who have signed the pledge, 345 are Greens, 338 Labour, 104 Liberal Democrats, and three Conservatives, with hundreds more from the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Scottish Greens, and local parties, or serving as independents.
Notable signatories include Green Party deputy leader Mothin Ali, Trafford councillor and by-election candidate Hannah Spencer, Labour’s Matthew Brown, leader of Preston City Council, and independent MP and Birmingham councillor Ayoub Khan.
The coalition is also promoting a People’s Pledge for Palestine, encouraging voters to support only candidates who have signed the Councillor Pledge.
The move comes as Labour faces declining support nationally, raising concerns of potential losses in key councils.
Richard Burgon, Labour MP for Leeds East, said: “Keir Starmer’s refusal to stand up for the rights of the Palestinian people is wrong and has already badly hurt Labour at the polls. We saw that in the last general election and I fear we will see it again in the May local elections.”
In some areas, the pledge could be decisive. In Hackney, where Labour holds a large majority, all six councillors from the Independent Socialists and several Green councillors have signed, compared with only three Labour representatives.
Green councilor and mayoral candidate Zoe Garbett said: “The council took a stand against South African apartheid and now it’s time we make a similar stand for the Palestinians.”
Independent Oxford councilor Hosnieh Djafari-Marbini said the pledge “highlights a candidate’s honesty, integrity, and consistency when it comes to the application of international law.”
Trafford councilor Hannah Spencer added: “People in Gorton and Denton – from all races and religions – are horrified at this inhumanity. They don’t want another Labour apologist for genocide, or a Reform cheerleader for Netanyahu. They want a real alternative. That’s what the Green Party is offering.”
Since the war in Gaza began on Oct. 8, 2023, Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, through the army and illegal settlers.
These actions include killings, arrests, demolitions, displacement, and settlement expansion.
Palestinians warn that the measures pave the way for Israel to formally annex the West Bank, which they say would undermine the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state as outlined in United Nations resolutions.
Israeli operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since Oct. 2023 have killed more than 1,115 Palestinians, injured about 11,500, and led to nearly 22,000 arrests.
The war in Gaza over two years has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians and wounded over 171,000, most of them women and children, and damaged about 90% of civilian infrastructure, according to Palestinian sources.

Trump says he will raise global tariff rate to 15% after Supreme Court verdict

President Donald Trump said Saturday he will raise a temporary tariff on U.S. imports from 10% to 15%, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against his signature tariff program based on an economic emergency law.
Angered by the decision, Trump on Friday ordered an immediate 10% tariff on all imports, in addition to existing duties. The law allows him to impose a levy of up to 15% for 150 days, though the move could face further legal challenges.
During that period, the administration will work on issuing new and “legally permissible” tariffs, he said.
“I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Deadly week on California slopes: 2 more skiers killed at US resort
At least 12 people have died this week in snow-sports-related incidents in California's Lake Tahoe area, including 9 in the Castle Peak avalanche, one from a collision, one at Northstar, and 2 at Heavenly
ANKARA
Two more skiers died in separate incidents on Friday at Heavenly Mountain Resort in California’s Lake Tahoe area, along the Nevada border, adding to a tragic stretch for snow sports in the region.
The victims were a 58-year-old man who suffered a medical emergency on the Tamarack Return trail and a 33-year-old man involved in a skiing accident on the intermediate Orion trail.
Both were transported to the base area by Heavenly Ski Patrol, where life-saving measures were applied but were unable to prevent them being pronounced dead.
The incidents are not connected, and there is no known relationship between the deceased.
The cause and manner of death are pending. Identification of the deceased will be released following notification of next of kin. This investigation remains active, police said.
The Lake Tahoe region averages 300 inches (762 centimeters) of annual snowfall at higher elevations, with a Sierra Nevada climate featuring cold winters, frequent storms, and high avalanche risk from rapid snow loading on weak layers—conditions worsened this month by heavy recent accumulations.
On Tuesday, at least eight backcountry skiers were killed in California's deadliest avalanche in recorded history near Castle Peak, with one additional person missing and presumed dead.
In total, at least 12 people have died in snow-sports-related incidents in the Lake Tahoe area this week: nine in the Castle Peak avalanche including one presumed dead, one collision death on Sunday, one death at Northstar on Thursday, and two at Heavenly on Friday.
The incidents at Heavenly on Friday are unrelated to each other and to the prior events, with authorities emphasizing no connection between the victims.

Syrian authorities take control of Qamishli airport under deal with SDF
Civil Aviation Authority says move completes part of broader agreement aimed at unifying airport management under state control in northeastern Syria
ISTANBUL
The Syrian Civil Aviation Authority said Saturday that it has taken over the management of Qamishli International Airport in northeastern Syria, under an agreement between the government and the terrorist organization YPG/SDF.
According to the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), the authority assumed control of the airport as part of the implementation of the broader agreement signed between Damascus and the SDF.
The authority said several department directors conducted a field visit to the airport, reviewing its technical and administrative status and discussing mechanisms to resume operations in line with international safety and efficiency standards.
Authority chief Omar al-Hosari described the step as “important within the path of unifying airport management under the umbrella of the state and ensuring operations according to the highest standards of safety and international efficiency.”
Qamishli airport holds strategic significance as the only airport in areas previously under SDF control. It has not operated civil flights for the past 15 years.
On Feb. 8, a delegation from the Syrian Interior Ministry met with SDF representatives to discuss the handover of the airport’s administration, SANA reported.
On Jan. 30, the Syrian government announced that it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the SDF aimed at ending division in the country and launching a new phase of integration. It said the deal covering the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous agreement signed on Jan. 18.
The latest agreement followed a military operation by the Syrian Army in which it regained large areas in eastern and northeastern Syria after repeated SDF violations of a March 2025 accord.

Trump vows to raise worldwide tariffs to 15% ‘effective immediately’
Supreme Court ruled on Friday that Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, ushered in under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, were unlawfully imposed

President Donald Trump vowed Saturday to raise worldwide tariffs to 15 percent “effective immediately,” in a Truth Social post.
On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, ushered in under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, were unlawfully imposed. The president had used the act to charge huge levies on countries, including 50 percent on India, which was later reduced, and 34 percent on China.
Speaking from the White House briefing room after the ruling Friday, a seething Trump called the 6-3 Supreme Court decision “deeply disappointing” and said he was “absolutely ashamed” of the Republican appointees on the court who’d failed to back his signature policy.
By Friday night, the president posted on Truth Social that he signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10 percent tax on imports from around the world. “It is my Great Honor to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a Global 10% Tariff on all Countries, which will be effective almost immediately,” Trump wrote.
Less than 24 hours later, Trump said he was bumping up the tariffs to 15 percent “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.”
“Please let this statement serve to represent that I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been “ripping” the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.
“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again - GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!!!” the president wrote on his social media platform.
The White House shared the president’s latest Truth Social on 15 per cent tariffs to its official X account Saturday.
Trump also hailed conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh his “new hero” after he sided with the president, as did Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
“My new hero is United States Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and, of course, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito,” Trump said in another Truth Social post. “There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
After the court’s decision, Trump announced he would instead use the 1974 Trade Act to continue his tariff agenda. But the Trade Act only allows a maximum tariff of 15 percent and comes with a limit of 150 days, unless Congress votes to extend it.
“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope. In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a 6-3 decision Friday.
Conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, both appointed by Trump, joined Roberts as well as liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson in ruling against the president.
Trump and his aides had expected a negative ruling in the case for months and have been preparing other authorities for taxing imports — which, like tariffs, are ultimately shouldered by consumers. But those other avenues are far more limited than the broad powers Trump had asserted for himself.
The president has also threatened to invoke Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act to impose as much as a 50 percent tax on imports from countries that discriminate against American products. That portion of the U.S. Code has its roots in the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff enacted during the Great Depression — with the effect of worsening the economic devastation caused by the stock market crash a year earlier — and has never been used by a president in the modern era.
The ruling does not impact all of Trump’s tariffs, just those brought under the 1970s law. That includes “reciprocal” tariffs on other countries since he announced that policy during an April event on what he’d dubbed “Liberation Day” as well as tariffs specifically imposed on Canada, China and Mexico to stop the flow of fentanyl.
Tariffs imposed on specific sectors, such as aluminum or steel — some of which date back to his first term —can remain in place.

Trump admin wants to deport a woman adopted from Iran by US veteran
- A woman adopted from an Iranian orphanage as a toddler by an American war veteran faces deportation to Iran, despite being raised Christian in the US and having no criminal record.
- She is among thousands of international adoptees who were never granted U.S. citizenship due to a legal oversight, with her visa overstay dating back to when she was four years old.
- The woman fears deportation to Iran could be a death sentence, citing severe persecution of Christians, especially converts, and current geopolitical tensions.
- Her lack of citizenship stems from a past requirement for adoptive parents to separately naturalise children, a process her deceased parents believed was completed.
- Although a 2000 law granted automatic citizenship to more recent adoptees, it was not made retroactive, leaving older adoptees in legal limbo despite bipartisan efforts to address the issue.

Zelenskyy urges EU to impose sanctions on maritime services used by Russia
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes the next EU sanctions package will include maritime services for vessels used by the Russian Federation.
Source: Zelenskyy's address
Quote: "We highly expect that the next sanctions package from the European Union will take into account what is needed to put real pressure on Russia for this war, namely to limit Russia's ability to wage war.
This also applies to the ban on maritime services for vessels used by Russia. Europe should come to this conclusion. This is what can become a significant incentive from Europe for Russia to finally move from war to diplomacy, to real diplomacy. The war must end."
Background: Zelensky announced Ukraine's new sanctions against 225 ship captains engaged in the transportation of Russian oil.

NASA moon rocket hit by new problem, putting March launch with astronauts in jeopardy
NASA's new moon rocket has suffered another setback, putting next month's planned launch with astronauts in jeopardy
- Bookmark
NASA’s new moon rocket has suffered another setback, putting next month’s planned launch with astronauts in jeopardy, the space agency announced Saturday.
Officials revealed the latest problem just one day after targeting March 6 for humanity’s first flight to the moon in more than half a century. Overnight, the flow of helium to the rocket’s upper stage was interrupted, they noted. Solid helium flow is required for launch.
NASA said it is reviewing all the data and preparing, if necessary, to return the Space Launch System rocket to the hangar for repairs at Florida's Kennedy Space Center. It's possible the work could be done at the launch pad; the space agency said engineers are protecting for both options.
“This will almost assuredly impact the March launch window.,” NASA said in a statement.
Hydrogen fuel leaks had already delayed the Artemis II lunar fly-around by a month. A second fueling test on Thursday revealed hardly any leaks, giving managers the confidence to aim for a March 6 liftoff.

Iranian students chant anti-government slogans, as US threats loom

PARIS - Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans and scuffled with counter-protesters on Feb 21 in the latest display of anger at the country’s clerical leaders, who also face a US military build-up aimed at pressuring them into a nuclear deal
The gatherings at universities, which were reported by both local and diaspora media outlets, followed a mass protest movement that was met with a government crackdown in January
The crackdown had prompted US President Donald Trump to threaten to intervene militarily, though the focus of his threats eventually shifted to Iran’s nuclear programme, which Western governments fear is aimed at producing a bomb.
The US and Iran recently resumed Oman-mediated talks aimed at securing a deal, but Washington has simultaneously increased its military presence in the region, dispatching two aircraft carriers, jets and weaponry to back its warnings.
Videos geolocated by AFP to Tehran’s top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd on Feb 21 as people shouted “bi sharaf”, or “disgraceful” in Farsi.
Footage posted by the Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
Iranians had reprised their protest slogans earlier this week to mark the 40th day since thousands of people were killed as a wave of demonstrations was peaking on Jan 8 and 9.
They gathered again at several universities in the capital on Feb 21, local media reported.
The unrest first broke out in December
The clerical authorities acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by “terrorist acts” fuelled by Iran’s enemies.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), however, has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.
Iranian authorities had initially acknowledged the legitimacy of the protesters’ economic demands, but as the movement took on an overtly anti-government tone, they accused archenemies the United States and Israel of whipping up “riots”.
Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a “silent and peaceful sit-in” on Feb 21 of students commemorating those killed was disrupted by people chanting slogans including “death to the dictator” – a reference to Iran’s supreme leader.
A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits.
Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.
Talks and threats
Ever since the initial wave of protests, the US and Iran have been trading threats of military action.
Mr Trump sent the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to the region, accompanied by a flotilla of 12 support ships, while a second carrier group attached to the USS Gerald R Ford is en route to the area via the Mediterranean.
The US has also redeployed dozens of other warplanes to the Middle East – where it maintains several bases – while boosting its land-based air defences.
The build-up is aimed at pressuring Iran’s authorities to cut a deal on the country’s nuclear programme, even as the two sides have pursued talks on the subject.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media this week that following the latest round of negotiations in Geneva, Iran would be submitting a draft proposal for an agreement, saying “in the next two, three days, that would be ready”.
Mr Araghchi also said the “US side has not asked for zero enrichment” of uranium, contradicting statements from American officials.
Mr Trump had suggested on Feb 19 that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, a period which he subsequently extended to 15.
Iran denies it is trying to produce nuclear weapons and says its programme is peaceful, but insists on its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes.
The US media outlet Axios reported this week, citing an unnamed senior US official, that the US was prepared to consider a proposed deal that only permitted “small, token enrichment”.
A previous round of nuclear diplomacy between the US and Iran in 2025 was interrupted by Israel’s surprise bombing campaign against the Islamic republic.
The United States ultimately joined its ally, striking key nuclear facilities before declaring a ceasefire. AFP

Trump says raising US global tariff rate from 10 per cent to 15 per cent
The move comes a day after the US Supreme Court ruled against the tariffs Trump imposed under an economic emergency law
A day after his stunning loss at the US Supreme Court, President Donald Trump said on Saturday he is raising from 10 to 15 per cent a temporary tariff rate on imports from all countries.
“I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10 per cent Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been “ripping” the US off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15 per cent level,” he said on social media.
He also said that in the next “short number of months,” his administration would “determine and issue the new and legally permissible tariffs”.
Trump also said on Friday he would use a second set of authorities under the same law, known as Section 301, to open investigations into countries’ unfair trade practices, which could yield additional tariffs. China is subject to investigations under the tool.

Russian forces shell Kostiantynivka with artillery, killing woman
Serhii Horbunov, head of the town’s military administration, reported this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
“This morning, February 21, the enemy shelled the town with artillery. Shells exploded near a residential building, causing significant damage and partial destruction of the facade. Unfortunately, this attack proved fatal for one local resident,” Horbunov wrote.
He clarified that the woman sustained injuries incompatible with life and died on the spot.
Horbunov expressed his sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of the deceased and urged all residents to evacuate to safer regions of Ukraine.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as of 8:00 on February 21, Russian troops carried out 26 attacks in the Kostiantynivka sector, including near Pleshchiivka, Rusyn Yar, Sofiivka, and toward Kostiantynivka, Ivanopillia, Berestok, Novopavlivka, Illinivka, and Stepanivka.

Alternative legal routes remain after US Supreme Court blocked Trump’s tariffs: Report
Court blocked tariffs imposed under IEEPA, but other federal trade laws still allow similar duties through alternative legal channels, says Fox News
ISTANBUL
Although the US Supreme Court has struck down President Donald Trump’s controversial tariffs, several alternative legal mechanisms remain available that could allow similar trade duties to be reintroduced, US outlets reported.
The court ruled 6-3 on Friday that Trump exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs, holding that the Constitution grants Congress – not the president – the power to levy tariffs.
In the decision, Chief Justice John Roberts said the framers assigned tariff authority “to Congress alone,” despite the foreign policy implications of trade measures. Though the challenge to the tariffs had broad appeal to the bench, including both liberal and conservative justices, far-right Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
Last year, after returning to the White House for a second term, Trump declared a “national emergency” on what he called “Liberation Day,” arguing that foreign countries were exploiting the US in global trade and citing the IEEPA as the legal basis for broad-based import duties.
While the ruling blocks the use of IEEPA for such tariffs, conservative-friendly Fox News reported that other statutes passed by Congress could provide alternative avenues.
One option is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes tariffs on imports deemed to threaten national security following a Commerce Department investigation. The provision was used in 2018 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and has been upheld in court. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has expanded the list of covered items by adding hundreds of derivative products linked to those metals.
Another pathway is Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which permits the US trade representative to investigate unfair trade practices and impose retaliatory tariffs. Tariffs imposed on Chinese goods under that authority have survived legal challenges, including a federal appeals court ruling last September rejecting claims brought by thousands of companies.
Section 122 of the same 1974 law – known as the “balance of payments” provision – allows the president to impose temporary tariffs of up to 15% for 150 days to address certain trade imbalances or unjustifiable restrictions on US commerce. The report noted that the provision has been less extensively tested in court.
In addition, the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act remains in effect, providing mechanisms to respond to dumping or foreign subsidies on a product-by-product basis.
According to the report, while the Supreme Court’s decision limits the use of emergency economic powers to impose sweeping tariffs, it does not eliminate other congressionally authorized routes that could enable the administration to pursue trade restrictions under different statutory frameworks.
While other legal routes may exist for applying tariffs, surveys show the levies remain broadly unpopular with the US public, who believe tariffs push up prices, despite Trump’s claim that foreign countries pay the tariffs, not US consumers.
Insistence by Trump on applying tariffs, whether legally allowable or not, could endanger Republican majorities in the US congressional elections this November, which polls show Democrats are already favored to win.

Europe's green transition is now a matter of energy security

Europe's green transition is now a matter of energy security

Climate Systems and Energy Policy unit expert at Stockholm Environment Institute Tallinn Centre
Europe's approach to energy security long rested on a simple idea: scale equals safety. That assumption is now being tested in Ukraine — and increasingly proven wrong.
For decades, coal-fired power plants have been the backbone of Europe's energy system, underpinning industrial growth, modern living standards, and what was long assumed to be a secure and resilient energy supply.
Today, Ukraine's costly experience shows that to build resilience, European energy systems must embed local renewables — a shift that requires timely and strategic investment.
On Feb. 3, Russian missiles struck Ukraine's Darnytsia thermal power plant, leaving Kyiv without electricity during one of the coldest winters in recent years. According to Ukraine's Energy Minister, four years into Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine, "there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that has not been hit," illustrating how Russia's systematic attacks have turned centralized civilian energy infrastructure into a weapon of war.
Ukraine's experience exposes a vulnerability that is not unique to Ukraine but is inherent to Europe's highly centralized energy system architecture, too.
In an era of escalating geopolitical risk, Europe can no longer treat centralized energy infrastructure as a guarantee of security. Ukraine's experience, acquired at immense human and economic cost, offers both a warning and a lesson. The question is whether the EU is prepared to learn that lesson and take early action by investing now in local renewable energy installations to support its larger systems.
Working with a Ukrainian municipal water station that serves more than 400,000 people, Stockholm Environment Institute Tallinn Centre explored how critical infrastructure can become more resilient by generating and managing its own clean, reliable energy — even when the central grid is under attack.
Our analysis of different renewable energy generation options showed that solar and wind systems paired with battery storage can provide reliable and affordable power for municipalities that can no longer depend solely on the centralized electricity grid.
The study showed that an area slightly larger than a football pitch can accommodate a battery-equipped wind energy system that generates 58.5 GWh annually — an amount of electricity comparable to the annual consumption of about 17,000 households.
In practice, this means installing wind turbines in the direct vicinity of the water station — either at ground level or on suitable structures.
The system's total lifetime cost is estimated at 46.2 million euros ($54.8 million), including 30.2 million euros ($35.9 million) in upfront investment. Spread over its 25-year lifetime, this translates into a levelized cost of electricity of 0.131 euros ($0,16) per kWh. While this figure does not include taxes or network charges, it remains below recent EU average household electricity prices of around 0.19 euros ($0,23) per kWh.
Across the EU, decentralized renewables and energy communities have long been deployed for climate mitigation, affordability, and citizen participation. Ukraine's experience adds another dimension: these systems are also instruments of security and resilience.
Installing renewables at critical infrastructure sites, strengthening municipal capacity to plan, generate, and manage local green energy systems, and enabling excess electricity to flow back into the grid now form part of Europe's security architecture as well as its climate action.
Needless to say, 46.2 million euros ($58.4 million) is a significant amount for a municipality in Ukraine — or anywhere in Europe.
This is where international financial institutions come into play. Numerous bodies, including but not limited to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Nordic Green Bank, and the World Bank, provide repayable and non-repayable financial assistance, often through programs specifically targeting municipalities, to support the resilience and decarbonization of local energy systems.
As Europe's priorities shift towards security investments to build resilience amid the climate crisis, EU member states and candidate countries like Ukraine should see investment in local renewable energy systems as a practical response to today's overlapping challenges.
Safeguarding essential infrastructure and advancing decarbonization, such systems address security and climate objectives simultaneously.
Ukraine's costly lesson is clear: scale alone does not guarantee safety. Energy systems built around centralized assets are vulnerable when targeted. Resilience depends on dispersing risk through decentralized generation, hybrid renewable configurations, and storage that can sustain essential services during disruption.
Crucially, sustainability and security need not be competing agendas. Europe now has the opportunity to align its climate investments with a new security reality, building an energy system designed not only to decarbonize, but to endure.

London Bridge attack hero sacked by police for using ‘p*key’ slur
Detective Constable Mark Luker has been fired for gross misconduct
- Bookmark
A police officer who was among the first on the scene of the 2017 London Bridge terror attack has been fired for gross misconduct.
Detective Constable Mark Luker of the British Transport Police used the word “p*key” in WhatsApp messages about Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller people.
In one message, he used the term “dags” – a reference to the film Snatch, in which one character struggles to understand another’s accent when he mentions dogs, a misconduct panel heard.
In another message, the panel was told, he referred to “scrap metal, lead roofing and cable”, which he accepted was a joke to associate the Irish Traveller community with theft.
The panel concluded that Mr Luker probably knew that the language was “offensive” to a minority community and ruled it gross misconduct.
The officer was a member of a WhatsApp group called ‘Selbie Gumshoes’ with other members of the Major Serious and Organised Crime (MSOC) team, the panel heard.
On 31 December 2024, during a conversation about someone winning a bottle of whiskey which still had a security tag attached, he wrote: “Was this a raffle on a certain kind of site? Lots of mobile type homes? Lots of ‘Dags’”, the panel was told.
He then added: “You are the MSOC p*key liaison.”
The panel found that these were “deliberate messages, that clearly link the Irish Traveller community to acts of theft”.
It added that the use of the word “dags” in the messages was “derogatory” as it refers to a scene in Snatch where a Gypsy character’s accent is “mocked”.
On 17 March 2025, another group member shared a video of “Paddy Day parade on Inishbofin”, with the message: “Just like a Disney World Parade. They know how to put on a show,” the panel heard.
Mr Luker replied: “Off to find some scrap metal, lead roofing and cable”, the panel was told.
The panel concluded that this was “deliberate and discriminatory” in linking the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community to theft.
On 27 March 2025, he used the word “p*key” again, which the panel found to be “disrespectful”.
Mr Luker said that he was one of the first responders to the 2017 terrorist attack on London Bridge and one of his coping mechanisms for dealing with the day can involve the use of humour.
He said he did not intend for the word “p*key” in the messages to be offensive.
The panel accepted that DC Luker is not “inherently racist”.
However, it wrote: “As an experienced BTP police officer used to dealing with a whole range of people, the panel found that, on the balance of probabilities, he probably would have known that this was an especially offensive use of language directed towards members of a minority community.”

The bodies of two men have been found in Eryri mountain range in north Wales after a large-scale search, police have said.
The men, aged 19 and 20, were reported missing on Wednesday, which sparked a search operation on the Eryri mountain range (Snowdonia).
Mountain rescue teams waded through snow and ice on Yr Wyddfa – also known as Snowdon – until the early hours of Thursday morning before resuming at 8am that day.
Both men were located and recovered, and their families have been informed, north Wales Police said on Saturday.
Jurgen Dissmann, chair of Llanberis mountain rescue team, said: “I would like to extend our most heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the two men who have tragically lost their lives.
“The team were tasked by north Wales Police and launched an extensive multiagency operation in full winter conditions.
“Volunteers searched across challenging mountain terrain in snow and ice, working long hours through the night in difficult weather in an effort to locate the pair as quickly as possible.
“Despite the determined and sustained commitment of everyone involved, we are deeply saddened that, despite all efforts, the outcome was not what we had hoped for.”
A spokesperson for north Wales Police said: “We can confirm that two bodies have been located in the Eryri mountain range during searches for two missing men, aged 19 and 20.
“Concerns for the welfare of the men were reported to police on Wednesday, 18 February.
“Tragically, the bodies of the two men were located and recovered as part of these coordinated search efforts. Both have now been formally identified, and their families have been informed.
“The coroner has been notified, and we ask that the privacy of the families is respected at this difficult time.”
Last June, two sisters, Hajra Zahid, 29, and Haleema Zahid, 25, died after being pulled from water on the Watkin Path, which leads to the summit of Snowdon.

Global leaders and businesses pore over fallout of more US tariff swoons
Business chiefs and government leaders are poring over the fallout of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated some tariffs by President Donald Trump's administration and his response to it
- Bookmark
South Korean trade officials scrambled Saturday to assess the impact of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling to invalidate some Trump administration tariffs, as business and governments around the world pored over the possible fallout from moves in Washington on the global economy.
The emergency meeting announced by the Trade Ministry in Seoul came as officials from South Korea to South America and beyond acknowledged tariffs would remain on some specific exports to the U.S., like automobiles and steel, that aren't affected by the U.S. high court decision.
It marked yet another swoon in the U.S. tariff posture since President Donald Trump returned to office 13 months ago, upending dozens of trading relationships with the world's biggest economy.
In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hailed the checks and balances in the United States, praising the “rule of law. during a visit to a Paris agricultural fair: “It’s a good thing to have powers and counter-powers in democracies. We should welcome that.”
But he cautioned against any triumphalism.
Officials were going over the language of bilateral or multilateral deals struck with the U.S. in recent months, even as they braced for new swings. Trump said Friday he plans new 10% global tariffs, under different rules.
“I note that President Trump, a few hours ago, said he had reworked some measures to introduce new tariffs, more limited ones, but applying to everyone,” Macron said. “So we’ll look closely at the exact consequences, what can be done, and we will adapt.”
Businesses brace south of the border — and beyond
Alluding to the new 10% tariff threat, Sergio Bermúdez, head of an industrial parks company in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, along the Texas border, said Trump “says a lot of things, and many of them aren’t true. All of the businesses I know are analyzing, trying to figure out how it’s going to affect them."
The impact could be felt especially in Juarez: Much of its economy depends on factories producing goods to export to consumers in the U.S., the result of decades of free trade between the U.S. and Mexico.
The policy swoons in the United States over the last year have made many global business leaders cautious, as they struggle to forecast and see investment take a hit.
Economy Secretary Marcelo Ebrard on Friday said Mexico was watching the tariffs with a “cool head,” noting that 85% of Mexico’s exports face no tariff, largely because of the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement. He plans a trip to the U.S. to meet with economic officials next week.
CEO Alan Russell of Tecma, which helps American businesses set up operations in Mexico, has seen his job grow increasingly complicated over the past year — his company's workload has surged as much as fourfold as it grapples with new import requirements. He worries the last U.S. moves will only make things more difficult.
“We wake up every day with new challenges. That word ‘uncertainty’ has been the greatest enemy,” said Russell, who is American. “The difficult part has been not being clear what the rules are today or what they’re going to be tomorrow.
Looking for a piece of possible tariff refunds
Some U.S. importers who paid what may turn out to be excess tariffs are looking for possible refunds — likely a very complex process — and some foreign companies may want to get their piece, too.
Bernd Lange, chairman of the European Parliament’s trade committee, insisted on Deutschland radio that excess tariffs “must be refunded.” He estimates German companies or their U.S. importers alone overpaid more than 100 billion euros ($118 billion).
Swissmem, a top technology industry association in Switzerland, hailed a “good decision” from the Supreme Court, writing on X that its exports to the U.S. fell 18% in the fourth quarter alone -- a period when Switzerland was facing much higher U.S. tariffs than most neighboring countries in Europe.
“The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry," Swissmem President Martin Hirzel said on X, while acknowledging the dust is far from settled. “However, today’s ruling doesn’t win anything yet.”

Zelenskyy says next meeting with Russia and US must not be empty, which is possible
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy considers it possible to make the next meeting with representatives of the Russian Federation and the United States "not an empty one".
Source: Zelenskyy's evening address
Quote: "We continue to work every day specifically to ensure that the next round of negotiations can deliver results for Ukraine and results for peace. Ukraine will certainly do everything necessary for this and will certainly not be an obstacle to peace.
Last time in Geneva, the American side clearly saw that it is precisely the Russians who are the reason for the absence of truly meaningful results. And the next meeting must not be empty; this is possible."
Details: Zelenskyy noted that on Saturday, he discussed certain aspects of the preparation for the negotiations with Rustem Umierov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council and head of the Ukrainian delegation.
"My meetings with European partners are also already scheduled for next week. We will coordinate in detail to ensure that Europe is involved in all processes and only grows stronger. I have also instructed Rustem to work more closely with our friends in the Middle East and in Türkiye so that they also feel involved and can provide greater assistance," Zelenskyy added.
Previously: On 20 February, Zelenskyy announced an agreement on a new round of negotiations in a trilateral format on ending the war in Ukraine within the next 10 days.
Background:
- On the morning of 18 February, Rustem Umierov said that the second day of Ukraine-US-Russia talks on resolving Russia's war against Ukraine had begun in Geneva.
- Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation, said later that the 18 February round of trilateral talks in Geneva on Russia's war against Ukraine had wrapped up. He said the talks lasted about two hours and were difficult but business-like.
- Zelenskyy said that during the talks, the parties had agreed that monitoring of compliance with a ceasefire would be carried out with the participation of the United States.
- He later added that the political issues surrounding possible compromises and the essential meeting between the two leaders were not sufficiently worked through at the trilateral Ukraine-US-Russia negotiations.

Don’t be fooled by recent good news, the UK economy is still in a precarious state

Too many Labour MPs want it all, and no amount of pleading from the top of government about the depleted public finances seems to make a difference.
The mainly leftist MPs want all the wrongs of the last 15 years put right and quickly. Their next opportunity to demand more cash arrives when Rachel Reeves delivers her spring statement on 3 March.
All the signs are that the chancellor will try to marry caution about the public finances – directed at backbench MPs – with an optimistic message about the economic recovery to cheer the public.
Whatever she says, there will be many on her own side who will demand that economic orthodoxy be ditched in favour of a bolder outlook delivered with a Liz Truss-like energy. Where the former prime minister extolled the virtues of tax cuts as economic rocket boosters, Labour MPs will instead trumpet public spending as the engine of growth.
Last week’s figures showing a record haul of tax receipts in January will have fuelled this desire, revealing, supposedly, that the Treasury is in good shape and able to accommodate their many and varied spending demands.
A drop in inflation from 3.4% in December to 3% in January was also good news, as was the increased likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England for struggling businesses and the mainly younger half of the population up to their ears in mortgage debt.
Lower inflation and lower interest rates, possibly cut from 3.75% to as low as 3% by the end of the year, will not only ease the cost of living crisis – which is still a crisis – it will also help the public finances.
Record tax receipts in January were joined by lower interest bills on government borrowing. Lower inflation will give public sector bodies more spending power and quell demands from unions for mega pay rises.
City economists estimate that there could be £10bn to £11bn more headroom when the chancellor gives her update on the public finances next month. That would push the Treasury’s financial buffer up to more than £30bn.
More broadly, surveys of the private sector show businesses are feeling more confident about the coming year, and company directors say that after a long hiatus, they are considering making investments again.
A major injection of private sector investment is what has been missing from the UK economy since the 2008 financial crash, so a rebound would be exactly the kind of lift Reeves and the government would cherish.
Retail sales improved in January beyond City economists’ expectations. Shoppers bought electronic goods by the bag load, trading in their barely out-of-the-box TVs and mobile phones for new models.
Yet the improved economic news cannot disguise the weaknesses at the heart of the UK economy and the excess demands on the public finances, which should put Labour MPs who agitate for more spending on the back foot.
Looking again at January’s tax receipts, it’s clear that much of the extra money came from capital gains tax (CGT) payments, and these were generated by individuals offloading assets to avoid tax hikes in the future.
That means the jump in CGT revenue was likely to have been based on one-off property and financial asset sales, and so gives little indication of the longer-term prospects for tax receipts.
Whatever happens between now and the end of the financial year, UK borrowing is likely to total about £130bn and be just short of 4.5% of annual national income – a figure the financial markets believe indicates the government is financially incontinent.
Baked into the forecasts of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) are deep budget cuts for most Whitehall departments to preserve more generous funding for the NHS, schools and defence. It’s only when the stringent spending limits imposed on most civil servants are kept in place that the annual deficit begins to fall.
Where are the pressure points on the public finances? One example is the £6bn in funding unaccounted for in 2029 from the additional cost of supporting children with special educational needs.
A report last week from the County Councils Network said spending on transport for Send children alone could be as much as £3.5bn in 2030. This is another bill that lies outside the current budget forecasts.
The prime minister has his own pet projects. Defence is currently his main focus and the budget for it may need to rise by as much as £10bn to meet a commitment to boost defence spending to 3% of national income by the end of the parliament.
Quite how he plans to carve out the funds to reach the 5% of national income in 2034 demanded by Donald Trump is not clear, but assuredly for a future prime minister to consider.
It is an illustration of how spare money is largely illusory at the moment. The public finances are in a precarious position and can still be blown off course by a rise in borrowing costs or the rising cost of youth unemployment, which will continue unless more investment can be deployed to boost growth.
Labour’s leftist MPs are in the same camp as the Green party leader, Zack Polanski, and the many Tory and Reform UK MPs who wish for things they cannot afford. There is no magic money tree. Liz Truss gave us an object lesson in chutzpah that no one wants to relive.

Hezbollah says 'resistance' is the only choice after deadly Israeli strike
A Hezbollah official on Saturday said that "resistance" was the only option after Israeli strikes in Lebanon killed eight of its operatives. On Friday, the Israeli military said it had hit Hezbollah command centres in eastern Lebanon and targets linked to the Palestinian group Hamas in the south.
Hezbollah warned Saturday that it would have no choice but to fight on after an Israeli strike on targets in Lebanon killed eight of its operatives.
Lebanon's government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but Israel insists it retains the right to defend itself by striking the Iran-backed militant group.
On Friday, the Israeli military said it had hit Hezbollah command centres in eastern Lebanon and targets linked to the Palestinian group Hamas in the south.
Hezbollah said Saturday that eight of its fighters had been killed, after Lebanon's health ministry said 10 people died in the east and two in the south.
"What happened yesterday in the Bekaa is a new massacre and a new aggression," Hezbollah official Mahmud Qamati said, in a speech broadcast by the Al-Manar network.
"What option do we have left to defend ourselves and our country? What option do we have other than resistance? We no longer have any option."
Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun also condemned the attacks, which came just days after the government said the army will start implementing the second phase of its plan to disarm Hezbollah in the south of the country.

The strikes came as tensions were also building between the United States and Iran, with US President Donald Trump threatening military action over the Islamic republic's nuclear programme.
Iran backs several armed groups in the region, including Hezbollah and Hamas.
In Lebanon's eastern city of Baalbek, a mass funeral was held for commander Hussein Mohammad Yaghi and one of the fighters, with hundreds of people gathered, waving Hezbollah flags and chanting support.
A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP all eight members of the group were attending a meeting in the eastern Bekaa region when a strike killed them.
The Israeli military said it had targeted "several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres in the Baalbek area".
An AFP correspondent in eastern Lebanon saw a bulldozer clearing debris following the strike on Bednayel, and a heavily damaged building between Riyak and Ali al-Nahri, where the Hezbollah official said the members were meeting.
The raids were against targets in residential areas, according to the correspondent.
They came hours after an Israeli strike on the country's largest Palestinian refugee camp in the south killed two people, according to the health ministry, with Israel's army saying it had targeted Hamas.
In a statement, Hamas condemned the attack, which it said led to civilian casualties as the targeted building "belongs to the joint security force charged with maintaining security and stability in the camp".
'Act of aggression'
Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to halt more than a year of hostilities with Hezbollah, usually saying it is targeting the group, but occasionally also Hamas militants.

Aoun called Friday's attacks "a blatant act of aggression aimed at thwarting diplomatic efforts" by the United States and other nations to establish stability.
Washington is one of five members of a multinational committee overseeing the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, with the body scheduled to meet again next week.
Hezbollah lawmaker Rami Abu Hamdan said the group "will not accept the authorities acting as mere political analysts, dismissing these as Israeli strikes we have grown accustomed to before every meeting of the committee".
He called on Beirut to "suspend the committee's meetings until the enemy ceases its attacks".
Lebanon's government last year committed to disarming the group, with the army saying last month it had completed the first phase of the plan covering the area near the Israeli border.
Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of rearming since the war, has called the Lebanese army's progress on disarming the militant group insufficient.
Against the backdrop of the tensions between Washington and Iran, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem said last month that any attack on the group's backer would also be an attack on the militants.

Bucha: The Inside Story the World Missed

Bucha is a Ukraine-made thriller about the first phase of Russia’s 2022 invasion, told through the real story of Konstantin Gudauskas, a Lithuanian Jew born in Kazakhstan, who stayed in Bucha and used a Kazakh passport to pass Russian checkpoints and evacuate civilians. The film is produced and written by Oleksandr Shchur, who previously wrote comedy for Volodymyr Zelensky before Zelensky became president, and directed by Stanislav Tiunov. Tiunov shot on location around Bucha and the wider Kyiv region, using (real) captured Russian vehicles and, in some scenes, real Ukrainian soldiers at the checkpoints.
In this interview, producer and scriptwriter Oleksandr Shchur explains why he saw Gudauskas’s story as globally legible, a foreigner with rare access choosing risk to save others, while director Stanislav Tiunov describes the decision to recreate events where they happened to keep the film close to lived reality. Together, they argue that Bucha is not only a single town in Ukraine’s memory, it is a template for what occupation can look like across the country, and why liberation in the Kyiv region became a national turning point.

K-Pop fans defend Belfast tribute concert amid complaints over ‘horrendous’ show
Fans of the genre pointed out that the event was never advertised as a ‘K-Pop Demon Hunters’ specific concert
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Fans of K-Pop have come to the defence of the organisers behind a major tribute concert in Belfast, following complaints from ticket-holders.
The KPop Forever! Tribute gig took place on Thursday night (20 February) at the city’s SSE Arena. Further shows are scheduled for next Monday (23 February) and later in May.
Some people who attended the concert reported feeling underwhelmed and disappointed, with one parent telling BBC News Northern Ireland that it was “just horrendous”.
Another atendee, Ruairi George O’Connor, said the performance, which he attended with his fiancée and their five-year-old daughter was “not appropriate for kids, at all”. Their daughter was left “bored out of her head” by the event, and asked “countless times to go home”, he said.
O’Connor added: “It was just devastating, it just wasn’t what I was expecting for the amount of money I was spending.”
Aiken Promotions and the SSE Arena defended the event, claiming that “the majority of customers enjoyed the show”, but admitted: “We understand that this was not what some expected.”
Their statement said they were “content” that the show delivered “an arena-standard tribute to the entire K-Pop genre” – with Aiken Promotions later adding that they took “all customers feedback seriously”.
As of Saturday (21 February), SSE Arena’s statement on Facebook has received nearly 2,000 comments from concert-goers and others debating the show’s quality.
Many fans of the genre pointed out that most of the complaints seemed to be over the lack of songs from KPop Demon Hunters, the 2025 smash hit film by Netflix, which has contributed to the rising popularity of K-Pop music.
They noted that such complaints are unreasonable given that the show was never advertised as a KPop Demon Hunters-themed concert.
“So in other words parents didn’t actually bother to research what they were buying tickets for?” wrote one person.
Another attendee, Michaela Hutchinson, told BBC News NI: “I knew what I signed up for. Whenever we bought the tickets, it was never advertised as a KPop Demon Hunters concert... it was KPop genre music.”
@tara_conaboy May aswell of burned the £250 spent on our 5 tickets 😶 The most confusing, underwhelming, boring load of dribble I’ve ever witnessed in my 42 years! And my children - well they’re probably out off concerts for life! Thank you @The SSE Arena, Belfast 👏🏼 #kpop #kcrap #belfast #concerttok @Love Belfast ❤️ ♬ original sound - BossMamaTara
She added that she had a great time with her six-year-old daughter at the concert, during which eight songs from the hit film were performed including “Golden”, “Takedown” and “Soda Pop”.
As for complaints that the show was unsuitable for children, Hutchinson said “it’s no different to a Katy Perry concert or a Beyonce concert”.
“Not at one point throughout the whole show did I think, ‘This is inappropriate,’” she said.
Commenting on a viral video of Thursday’s event showing a seated crowd apparently bored, one person defended the act, writing: “I feel so bad for the performers that worked so hard on this just to get complaints.”
“The poster never said it was a KPop Demon Hunters tribute btw. Read the poster,” said one person.
“KPop is a genre NOT a movie,” reiterated another. “That’s like going to a rock concert and being confused why Dwayne Johnson didn’t show up,” said someone else.
Posted by username @tara_conaboy, the video was captioned: “May as well of burned the £250 spent on our 5 tickets. The most confusing, underwhelming, boring load of dribble I’ve ever witnessed in my 42 years.”
SSE Arena’s website describes the concert as featuring “all-live performances of smash-hits including Blackpink, BTS, Twice, Soda Pop, Golden and many more, this is the ultimate non-stop party for all ages”.
The website advertises “four epic live vocalists, accompanied by four world class dancers amidst a background of eye-popping lighting and effects”.

Blood-stained gloves were found near Nancy Guthrie’s home as search enters third week with still no suspects

Blood-stained gloves were found near Nancy Guthrie’s home as search enters third week with still no suspects
- Bookmark
A pair of blood-stained gloves were found in the desert near Nancy Guthrie’s home, a couple have claimed, as the search for the 84-year-old enters its third week with no named suspects.
Nancy Guthrie, the elderly mother of Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen at her home in the affluent Catalina Foothills, outside Tucson, Arizona, on January 31.
She was abducted from her home in the early hours of February 1. Police later shared doorbell cam footage of a suspect wearing a ski mask and dark gloves.
On Friday a couple revealed to local outlet KVOA that they came across a pair of black gloves in the desert, less than a mile from Guthrie’s neighborhood, on February 11.
“Sure enough it was a black glove in the desert it appeared to have looked like it was ripped,” the woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said. “It also appeared to like it looked like it had blood on it. The blood appeared to be towards the wrist side of the glove and on the pointer finger,” she continued.
The couple found a second glove, that appeared to match, less than 10 feet away.
“And also from the glove it looked like a blood drop on a rock underneath the glove was like dried blood or something,” the husband added. “We didn’t move it or touch it. We immediately were like we have to do something.”
The couple said they called police who questioned them at the scene for some time, according to the outlet.
In a statement to The Independent, Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Saturday they “cannot confirm” whether the gloves found by the couple were being tested for DNA.
“Detectives and agents have collected multiple gloves from the area and analysis is part of the investigation,” the department said.
Earlier this week, the department announced on social media that DNA on a pair of gloves found two miles from Guthrie’s home “did not trigger a match” in the FBI’s national database and “did not match DNA found at the property.”
It was not immediately clear whether the update is related to the gloves found in the desert by the couple.
As the case enters the third week, sources told ABC News that investigators may soon scale back resources given the lack of progress. There are 400 investigators working on the case 24/7 at the moment, but sources told the outlet that a smaller task force could move in as leads are “so far coming up empty.”
The sheriff’s department says the investigation remains active. “As long as leads continue to come in, investigators will continue to follow up on them,” the department said in a statement. “Currently, several hundred personnel are assigned to this case from various law enforcement agencies and are actively reviewing thousands of tips.”
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos, who has come under intense scrutiny over the case, vowed his team would find Nancy Guthrie in an interview Friday.
“We’re not quitting,” he told NBC News. “We’ll find her.”
Between the FBI and local officials, the reward for information in the case has grown to more than $200,000.
Savannah Guthrie has posted videos online pleading with the kidnapper to return her mother. “I wanted to say to whoever has her, or knows where she is, that it’s never too late,” Guthrie said in an Instagram video last weekend. “It is never too late to do the right thing.”
The TV star said that her mother needs medication for her health condition.
“Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,” the news anchor pleaded in a video posted on social media.

Ukraine hits Russian planes, ships in Crimea, artillery in major strikes on occupied territories
Ukraine’s armed forces struck Russian ships, planes, and artillery units in Russian-occupied Crimea and the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine's Armed Forces General Staff announced on Feb. 21.
In Crimea, close to Sevastopol, Ukrainian forces hit two Russian border patrol ships of Project 22460 Hunter, part of the Rubin class of Russian Coast Guard vessels designed to combat surface and airborne threats.
Ukraine previously targeted the same class of ship in December with sea drones, although the General Staff did not confirm if drones were used in the latest attack.
Further north on the peninsula, Ukraine hit two Be-12 Chayka aircraft stationed at the Yevpatoria Aviation Repair Plant. Ukraine first hit Be-12 aircrafts in September 2025, also in occupied Crimea.
The Soviet-designed Be-12 Chayka is an anti-submarine amphibious aircraft equipped with high-value systems used for detecting and engaging submarines. They have been used in combat over the Black Sea.
The final extent of the damage on the Crimean Peninsula is still being assessed, the General Staff said. "The Ukrainian Defense Forces continue to systematically reduce the aggressor's combat potential, depriving it of the ability to conduct offensive operations," they added.
In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian forces destroyed Russia’s equivalent of HIMARS — a Tornado-S multiple launch rocket system. They have a firing range of 120 kilometers using high-precision, wide-range rockets, terrorizing Ukrainian civilians in frontline regions.
"Tornados are a nightmare for Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Kherson, Nikopol, and other peaceful cities of Ukraine," said Robert 'Madyar' Brovdi, Commander of Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces.

Parliaments of Ukraine and Poland to sign strategic cooperation agreement – Marshal of Polish Sejm
Czarzasty said this in an interview with Ukrinform.
“I will sign with the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada a new Polish-Ukrainian agreement on strategic cooperation and the creation of a parliamentary-expert group, but I will wait to share the details until our meeting,” Czarzasty said.
He emphasized that parliamentary cooperation between Ukraine and Poland is intensive.
“There is, in particular, the Polish-Ukrainian Parliamentary Group and the Parliamentary Assembly of Ukraine and Poland. I am going to Kyiv with a large delegation, including Deputy Marshal Monika Wielichowska and MP Paweł Kowal. These are proven friends of Ukraine,” Czarzasty added.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Marshal Czarzasty during his visit to Warsaw in December, where the parties discussed strengthening defense cooperation, economic partnership, and support for Ukrainians who found temporary shelter in Poland.
In December, the XIV session of the Parliamentary Assembly of Ukraine and Poland was held in Lviv, resulting in the signing of a joint declaration.

Iran refusing to export highly enriched uranium but willing to dilute purity, sources say

Iran is refusing to export its 300kg stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but is willing to dilute the purity of the stockpile it holds under the supervision of UN nuclear inspectorate the IAEA, Iranian sources have said.
The proposal will be at the heart of the offer Iran is due to make to the US in the next few days, as the US president, Donald Trump, weighs whether to use his vast naval build-up in the Middle East to attack the country.
Iran currently has a stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, close to weapons grade, but is willing to down-blend the purity to 20% or below.
Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, is also claiming that there has been no US demand to even abandon the right to enrich inside Iran. The focus is instead on the purity of the enrichment and the number of centrifuges to be permitted.
There had been discussion of the stockpile being sent to Russia, and for Iran’s domestic enrichment programme to be linked in with an overseas consortium, but Iranian sources are insisting the concept of a consortium has not been raised.
Iranian media close to the government quoted an Iranian diplomat as saying: “We emphasised this position during the negotiations that nuclear materials will not leave the country.”
The Iranian account of its relatively uncompromising position means a great deal of weight will have to be placed on the degree of access the IAEA would be given to inspect nuclear sites.
The Iranian offer is likely to determine whether Trump feels compelled to launch military action against Iran.
In an interview in the US, aired on Friday, Araghchi said: “Washington has not asked Tehran to permanently suspend uranium enrichment,” adding that Tehran had not offered Washington a temporary suspension of its uranium enrichment.
He rejected reports that Iran had proposed suspending uranium enrichment for two to three years, saying: “It is not true that the United States has called for a complete cessation of enrichment.”
His remarks were contradicted by the US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, who, prompted by his interviewer, said the US was seeking “zero enrichment” by Iran.
Reza Nasri, an Iranian lawyer with contacts inside the foreign ministry, warned: “If Iran is attacked while nuclear disagreements can still be settled diplomatically in a fair and equitable manner, other regional states will inevitably draw one conclusion: nuclear weapons are the only real deterrent against the US and Israel.”
The news came as protests erupted at some universities, prompting fresh clashes in the street, at Mashhad University of Medical Services and at least two Tehran universities.
The universities were reopening after being closed due to fear of protests. At Sharif University, the students chanted “Javed Shah”, “Until the mullah is shrouded, this homeland will not become a homeland” and “Death to the dictator.” The Sharif University president urged the students to stop, warning that the authorities would force classes back online.
Protests are also expected at a meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday when an Iranian official, Afsaneh Nadipour, takes her seat for the first time as a full member of the advisory council. Nadipour, a former Iranian ambassador to Denmark, is due to provide input on women’s rights.
The UN Human Rights Council Advisory Committee is comprised of 18 independent experts from five UN regional groups and serves as the intellectual arm of the Human Rights Council. Nominations are made by governments and are selected by the council.
She was elected for a three-year term in October.

Kennedy Center performance canceled after ‘targeted attack’ on outdoor ice rink
A ‘toxic chemical’ was spread across the ice, officials say
- Bookmark
The temporary outdoor ice rink at the Kennedy Center was the subject of a “targeted attack” Friday with a “toxic chemical” spread across the ice, cancelling a planned performance, according to officials.
"[A] targeted attack on the Trump Kennedy Center vandalized and destroyed our outdoor arena, causing severe damage that we unfortunately must cancel [Friday’s] performance, but we are working feverishly to complete repairs so programming can resume tomorrow," Roma Daravi, vice president of public relations for the center, said in a statement to The Independent.
"We have turned over video footage to the authorities who are investigating this calculated, malicious attack and hold those responsible accountable."
A photo of the incident showed a black substance spread across the ice, under a gallon-sized milk jug.
The rink had been planning to host a performance Friday from Le Patin Libre, a Montreal-based skating troupe. The Independent has contacted Le Patin Libre for comment.
Kennedy Center leadership claimed without evidence that the Democratic Party, which has criticized the president’s management and attempted renaming of the center after himself, was linked to the attack.
“This is so sad & unnecessary - The Democrats have been calling artists urging them to cancel and attacking the Center non-stop,” Kennedy Center Richard Grenell wrote on X Friday. “It’s a calculated campaign. And now they have mentally unstable people taking action - and vandalizing the Center.”
“We’ve seen serious death threats and constant harassment,” Grenell added. “Commonsense Democrats must speak up before this violence takes a life.”
The U.S. Park Police is investigating the incident, first reported by Fox News, and the center has turned over footage to the FBI, officials said.
“The center’s Special Police reported that an unidentified individual came onto the property around 11:54 p.m. Thursday and poured a substance onto the ice,” the Park Police told The Independent in a statement. “The USPP Major Crimes Unit is reviewing security footage and investigating. No further information is available at this time.”
The Independent has contacted the FBI and the Democratic Party for comment.
The ice rink incident comes a day after an an unfounded bomb threat was called into the Kennedy Center, prompting a temporary evacuation, as the Chinese dance troupe Shen Yun was due to perform in a rented theater there. The performance went ahead as planned.
It has been a tumultuous period at the flagship national arts complex in Washington, D.C.
In December, the center’s board, installed by President Trump, voted to rename the center after the president. Democratic lawmakers argued the move was illegal and needs to be approved by Congress, prompting Rep. Joyce Beatty to sue. Family members of late President John F. Kennedy, the memorial’s original namesake, also criticized the change.
Since Trump and his allies took over the center, high-profile artists like composer and pianist Philip Glass and comedian Issa Rae have cancelled planned performances.
Earlier this month, President Trump said the center would be closed in July for a two-year renovation process, further outraging critics.
“Countless employees, artists, and others have existing contracts and agreements with the Center,” Beatty said in a statement at the time. “What happens to them? Has Trump or his handpicked Board given any consideration to their livelihoods or futures? This is precisely why congressional oversight is essential.”
The center has reportedly struggled with ticket sales since the Trump administration took office.
The White House argues the center was in poor shape and needs hundreds of millions of dollars of deferred maintenance.

Ukraine strikes ballistic missile producer deep inside Russia, Kyiv says

KYIV, Feb 21 - Ukraine hit a Russian plant manufacturing ballistic missiles in a missile strike in the remote Udmurtia region, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Saturday.
Ukraine said its forces attacked the plant manufacturing Russian missiles, including the short-range Iskander and intercontinental Topol-M, in Votkinsk, east of Moscow and about 1,400 km (800 miles) from Ukraine.
It said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that the Ukrainian forces used domestically produced ground-launched Flamingo cruise missiles. The attack caused a fire on the site, the Ukrainian military said.
Alexander Brechalov, the governor of the Udmurtia region in Russia, had earlier said a site there had been attacked overnight with drones.
"There has been damage and injuries as a result," Brechalov said in a video posted on the Telegram app. He provided no other details.
The airport in Udmurtia's main city, Izhevsk, and those in cities in nearby regions suspended operations, the civil aviation authority Rosaviatsiya said.
The unofficial Russian Telegram channel SHOT, which often quotes contacts in the security services, said residents in Votkinsk reported hearing at least three explosions and the humming of drones.
Russia uses its ballistic missiles to reinforce its drone attacks on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure, knocking out electricity and heating supplies for millions across Ukraine during the cold winter months.
Ukraine is increasingly targeting military and energy infrastructure deep inside Russia. Kyiv says that hitting the weapons producers and the energy system that fuels Russia's military is the best way to gain leverage over its bigger enemy as the war enters its fifth year next week.
The Ukrainian military said it also hit a gas processing plant in the Russian Samara region. Russian officials in the Samara region issued no report of such an attack. REUTERS

Iran says will not 'bow' to pressure amid US nuclear talks as anti-govt protests reported in Tehran
President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran "will not bow" to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the US. Meanwhile, Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans at rallies for the thousands killed during last month's demonstrations, local and diaspora media reported.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that his country would not bow its head to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the United States.
"World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads... but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us," Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live by state TV.
Meanwhile, Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans at rallies for people killed during a recent wave of demonstrations, local and diaspora media reported Saturday, as groups protesting the clerical leadership faced off with others voicing support for the government.
Videos geolocated by AFP to at Tehran's top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd as people shouted "bi sharaf", or "disgraceful" in Farsi.

Footage posted by the Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.
Iranians had reprised their protest slogans this week to mark the 40th day since the deaths of thousands of people as a wave of demonstrations was peaking on January 8 and 9, in line with Shiite mourning tradition.
They gathered again at several universities in the capital on Saturday, local media reported.
The unrest first broke out in December over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government demonstrations that were suppressed in a violent crackdown by security forces that rights groups say killed thousands.
The clerical authorities acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by "terrorist acts" fuelled by Iran's enemies.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), however, has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.

Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a "silent and peaceful sit-in" of students commemorating those killed was disrupted by people chanting slogans including "death to the dictator" – a reference to Iran's supreme leader.
A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits.
Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.
The demonstrations come as Iran's authorities are under pressure to make a deal on the country's nuclear programme with the United States, which has deployed forces within striking distance.
US President Donald Trump had threatened military action against Tehran during the protests over the crackdown by security forces.

Yaroslav Hrytsak, historian: 'Ukraine is still standing, against all odds. It is a miracle'

Yaroslav Hrytsak, age 66, is a professor at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv. He is the most renowned living historian in Ukraine and the author of a seminal book on the country's history, Ukraine: The Forging of a Nation.
The Russian invasion of Ukraine began four years ago, on February 24, 2022. What is your assessment of these years of war?
Resilience. Ukraine still stands, against all odds. It's a miracle. There is no rational explanation. As a historian, I used to compare this war with the First World War, with a stalemate on the front line, with a war of attrition, which ends in the collapse of one of the sides. I was afraid from the very beginning Ukraine may collapse, because basically it boils down to resources since Ukraine could not be compared to Russia. My fears have not been confirmed. People feel the situation is not getting better but not getting worse. There is a kind of restricted optimism, which is a sign of resilience.
Ukraine was saved in 2022 by its incredible resistance against the columns of Russian tanks. Is that spirit of resistance still as strong?
No, and this is a paradox. The resilience is very strong, but not that many people are now willing to fight. One factor is that the front is rather stabilized. Another one is that, in 2022, there was a very strong solidarity and the idea that we share the responsibility and the burden. Today, people don't believe that it makes much sense to go to the front and, since the "Mindichgate" [the corruption scandal that shook the Ukrainian government in 2025], they feel there is a kind of injustice. Ukrainians now see those who are fighting as gladiators. People sympathize with them, but let them fight. Ukraine needs a second breath.
The war affects every individual, every family. How has the conflict changed your life?
I lost my godson last month. He was killed near Pokrovsk. Young, smart, very creative. He saved cats from Pokrovsk. One cat is living here. A cat with three legs, probably wounded during the war. So the cats are saved, but he is not. And there was a burial here, on the new graveyard, because the old graveyard is already filled. And one of my students has been killed as well, fighting. So this is how you feel about the war.

Palestine, Jordan and Egypt slam US envoy’s remarks on Israeli control of Middle East

The Palestinian Foreign Ministry on Saturday said comments by the US ambassador to Israel suggesting acceptance of Israeli control over the entire Middle East amount to “an explicit call to violate the sovereignty of states.”
Speaking to journalist Tucker Carlson, Huckabee this week argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying: "It would be fine if they took it all.”
In a statement, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the remarks, saying they “contradict religious and historical facts and international law,” and also contradict statements by US President Donald Trump rejecting annexation of the occupied West Bank.
The ministry said the “provocative” comments represent “an explicit call to violate the sovereignty of states.”
The remarks, it added, provide support for Israel to continue a war of genocide and displacement and to pursue annexation and expansion plans against the Palestinian people – steps it said have been rejected by the international community, which considers Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, occupied Palestinian territory under international law.
The ministry called on the US to take a clear and explicit position on Huckabee’s statements and to reaffirm the positions announced by Trump regarding achieving peace in the Middle East, ending wars and violence, and rejecting Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
It said the comments “do not help achieve President Trump’s vision for lasting peace in the Middle East.”
‘Flagrant departure’
Jordan also condemned remarks by US Ambassador to Tel Aviv Mike Huckabee suggesting acceptance of Israel’s control over the entire Middle East, in addition to the occupied West Bank, calling the comments “absurd and provocative.”
Egypt’s Foreign Ministry condemned the statements, describing them as a “flagrant departure” from the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
Cairo expressed surprise at the remarks, saying they contradict the vision put forward by US President Trump and the related 20-point framework aimed at ending the war in Gaza, as well as the outcomes of a Board of Peace conference held in Washington on February 19.
Egypt reiterated that Israel has no sovereignty over occupied Palestinian land or any other Arab territories, stressing its categorical rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank, separate it from Gaza, or expand settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel last April, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a “Greater Israel.” He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission” including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
“Greater Israel” is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Union blames ‘recruitment crisis’ for Royal Mail delivery delays
The company is failing to deliver for customers, says union secretary
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Royal Mail is facing a persistent failure to meet its delivery targets, a problem the postal workers’ union blames on a long-term recruitment crisis.
The group is now advocating for urgent changes, including the controversial move to scrap second-class post deliveries on Saturdays.
Between 29 September and 30 November, 91.6 per cent of second-class mail was delivered within three working days, while 77.5 per cent of first-class post arrived the next working day.
Communication Workers Union (CWU) general secretary Dave Ward said: “These results prove conclusively that the company’s failure to deliver for customers is a long-term problem.
“These failures are due to a recruitment crisis that has been caused by the decision to impose low wages and poor conditions on new starters in 2022.
“This devaluing of a postal worker’s job, combined with a toxic managerial culture, has created chaos and demoralisation in almost every workplace across the country.
“The company will claim that the delays can only be resolved if the USO (Universal Service Obligation) reform is implemented immediately.
“However, Royal Mail’s proposal for implementing the new changes will only make matters worse and will result in Ofcom fining the company out of existence.”
Royal Mail said the figures mark an improvement on the previous quarter, but still falls short of the targets set by Ofcom, which are for 93 per cent of first-class post to be delivered the next day and 98.5 per cent of second-class to be delivered within three days.
Royal Mail chief executive Alistair Cochrane said: “While these results show improvements for both first and second-class mail, we recognise that our performance in letters is still not good enough.”
A Royal Mail spokesperson said: “Whilst most parcel delivery companies operate ‘gig economy’ self-employment models, with low pay, no sick pay, holiday or pensions, Royal Mail is proud to offer the best terms and conditions in our industry.
“That is why we attract on average 15 applicants for every role and we have such a long serving and dedicated workforce, with colleagues choosing to stay with us for 16 years on average.
“But offering the best conditions in our industry is becoming more financially challenging when the rest of the parcels industry is engaged in a race to the bottom on pay and conditions.
“In the face of this we must modernise Royal Mail so that we can deliver a more reliable and efficient service for our customers, and at the same time we are engaging with the Government on what needs to be done to level the playing field on employment rights in the delivery sector, so that workers across industry can benefit from fair pay and secure employment.”

The deadly clash took place on Saturday in KP’s Bannu district, with the Pakistani military saying at least five armed fighters, including one it described as “a suicide bomber” were also killed during the operation.
The military said that the bomber was stopped by the leading security team, preventing his attempt to attack civilians and law enforcement personnel and averting “a major catastrophe”.
The army referred to the fighters as “khawarij” – the term it uses for banned groups, according to Al Jazeera.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the statement said.

US Military Preparations Against Iran are Entering Their Final Phase
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

00:30:00 KST

The concentration of American military forces around Iran has reached a level not seen since 2003, inevitably prompting comparisons with Iraq.
However, such comparisons can be misleading if the differences in the structure and purpose of the deployed forces are not considered.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
In 2003, the military deployment was clearly aimed at a land invasion of Iraq, the rapid overthrow of the regime, and full control of the territory.
The current deployment of forces around Iran does not bear this signature. There are no visible elements indicating preparations for a large-scale ground operation.
Instead, a combination of naval and air capabilities has been assembled to conduct an intense but limited strike campaign, designed to last, be repeated, and function even under constant Iranian counterattacks.
A series of smaller decisions, not a single tipping point
Such deployment of forces changes how the conflict is fought and controlled. It allows the decision to use force to be divided into phases, the intensity of strikes to be adjusted according to political signals and the adversary’s reactions, and escalation to remain under constant civilian control.
Rather than a single tipping point, a series of smaller decisions can be made, which can be escalated, paused, or stopped without losing military initiative.
This ability to control the pace makes the current deployment more dangerous and unstable, as it prolongs a state of constant tension and increases the risk of misjudgement on both sides.

The presence of two aircraft carriers with full strike groups, numerous destroyers equipped with anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence systems, and a submarine with cruise missiles constitutes a force that is not a temporary show of strength.
It is a combat configuration capable of initiating and sustaining operations for several weeks, even under enemy attack.
Such a structure is not maintained at a high level of readiness without a realistic assessment that it will be used, unless a late and politically costly decision to withdraw is taken.
In this respect, the military logic has already been established. What remains open is the political timing of the decision.
Aircraft carriers as mobile air bases
The naval component of the deployment plays a central operational role. Aircraft carriers are not present merely as a show of force but serve as mobile air bases that enable continuous combat flights without depending on land-based airfields in the region.
Their purpose is not a single strike but maintaining continuity of operations over an extended period. With destroyers, which provide missile strikes against land targets and anti-aircraft protection for the fleet, the capacity for repeat attacks and the suppression of enemy defences is established.
Submarines further complicate the opponent’s planning. Their presence introduces constant uncertainty into assessments of the direction and timing of attacks, expands the range of possible actions, and forces the opponent to allocate resources defensively.
Overall, this deployment of forces is designed to conduct combat operations over a prolonged period, rather than a brief and limited demonstration of force.
A system that observes, strikes, defends, and adapts
The distribution of air forces in the region reflects clear operational requirements. Bases in the Gulf and the wider area have been selected to enable continuous combat flights, rapid reinforcement, and the continuation of operations even under enemy attacks.
Such deployment allows for deep strikes, constant reconnaissance, repeated attacks, and the protection of one’s own bases and airspace.
Its strength lies not in its individual aircraft, but in its ability to conduct continuous operations with a clear division of tasks and reliable control and coordination from command centres.
It is a system that observes, strikes, defends, and adapts simultaneously.
Such a distribution of forces allows the campaign to be conducted in clearly defined stages, with the ability to adjust intensity as needed.
Initial actions would focus on disabling observation and command systems, creating opportunities for precise strikes on key targets deep inside the territory.
Subsequent actions would be repeated to permanently reduce military capabilities, rather than attempting their complete destruction in a single attack.
Throughout the process, maintaining air superiority and protecting bases and naval forces would remain constant priorities.
A state of constant uncertainty
Iran is not a passive participant in this framework. Its response does not rely on countering American military power in the traditional sense but on exerting pressure through large-scale and asymmetric strikes.
Iran’s missile strategy employs a mix of various missile types and unmanned systems, aiming to overwhelm air defences, deplete interceptor stocks faster than they can be replenished, and keep the enemy in a constant state of uncertainty.
The greatest risk for the American side is not a single successful attack, but a series of limited-intensity attacks that are repeated and dispersed across the region.
Large, fixed bases, logistics hubs, and maritime routes are particularly vulnerable. The Strait of Hormuz plays a central role in this context.
Iran does not need to close it to have a significant impact; it is sufficient to make it insecure. The mere perception of risk raises insurance costs, slows shipping, and introduces instability into energy markets.
The political timing of the decision
Therefore, the military and economic aspects of this crisis cannot be considered separately.
Prolonging the conflict increases the likelihood that markets will begin to internalise long-term volatility in energy and transport prices.
Even limited physical damage can have a disproportionate global effect if the region is perceived to be entering a phase of permanent unpredictability and crisis.
This situation cannot be understood if viewed solely through the ratio of military capabilities.
American forces are already deployed to allow rapid action without further preparations or visible changes on the ground.
The absence of signs of a ground operation does not mean that the option of using force is off the table; rather, it indicates that a form of warfare conducted from a distance, through air and naval strikes, has been chosen.
Thus, the key question is no longer whether the United States has the capability to conduct such a campaign. That issue does not exist.
The questions of the timing of the political decision, the scope of possible strikes, and the assessment of whether the risks of wider escalation and economic consequences are acceptable in relation to Washington’s objectives remain unresolved.
For now, the distribution of forces itself leaves little room for alternative interpretations. This level of readiness cannot be sustained indefinitely without a decision to use force.

Orbán threatens to halt electricity supplies to Ukraine, nearly half of Ukraine's imports
Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has threatened to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine if oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline is not restored.
Source: Telex, an independent Hungarian news portal, citing Orbán at an event with activists of the Fidesz party in the city of Bekescsaba, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Orbán was asked several questions by the audience about the Druzhba oil pipeline, which was damaged by the Russians, but the Hungarian government blames Ukraine for the disruption in supplies.
Orbán said Ukrainians aimed to create economic chaos and an energy emergency in Hungary and to bring about the defeat of the Fidesz party in April's elections.
Quote: "Chaos in the minds of Ukrainians is the path to the opposition's victory in the elections."
More details: Orbán did not rule out that if Ukrainians fail to restore pipeline transit, Hungary would stop supplying electricity to Ukraine.
Quote: "Much of the electricity comes into Ukraine from Hungary. If we stop this, bad things could happen...
Of course, we make some mistakes, but you cannot say we are crude or brainless. We know exactly how to deal with such a situation and we will deal with it. Anyone who bites us will have their teeth knocked out."
For reference: Hungary is an important supplier of electricity to Ukraine, with the share of imports from Hungary reaching 50% of Ukraine's overall electricity import structure in February 2026. ExPro, a Ukrainian analytical agency, estimates that in 2025 Ukraine imported about 1.4 million MWh from Hungary, which accounts for 42% of all imports.
Background:
- Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has said he will move to stop his country's electricity exports to Ukraine unless Kyiv restores Russian oil transit to Slovakia by Monday 23 February.
- Fico wants to send a monitoring mission to the site of damage to the Druzhba pipeline in the Ukrainian city of Brody to obtain an expert assessment of the damage.

Young man fatally stabbed outside mosque in central England during Muslim holy month of Ramadan
18-year-old dies at scene in Smethwick near Birmingham, triggering police murder investigation; 2 others injured, incident not currently being treated as religiously motivated
LONDON
UK police have launched a murder investigation after a young man was stabbed to death outside a mosque in England's West Midlands during celebrations of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Officers were called over reports of disorder outside a place of worship on Oldbury Road in Smethwick, near Birmingham, on Friday evening. The young man, 18, was found in critical condition and died at the scene.
Two other young men, ages 19 and 22, were also injured in the incident and were taken to the hospital. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
Detectives said that though the fatal stabbing occurred during Ramadan, it is not currently being treated as religiously or racially aggravated.
A spokesperson for West Midlands Police said in a statement: “We're working to establish the full circumstances and who was involved.
“We're reviewing CCTV and carrying out other enquiries in the area.”
Police said inquiries remain ongoing as officers seek to determine how the violence unfolded and who was responsible.

Report: Hezbollah preparing for possible war With Israel, Iranian officers directing group

Hezbollah is increasing the frequency of internal meetings in preparation for a possible war with Israel, according to a report by Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya, amid assessments that Iran is pressuring the group to join any military campaign launched against it.
Sources cited by the network said that, “by all indications,” the Israeli airstrikes carried out Friday in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley were a prelude to a broader Israeli military operation that could coincide with strikes in Iran.
The report quoted sources close to Hezbollah who told Al-Arabiya and the Saudi channel Al-Hadath that the group is currently being directed not by Lebanese leaders but by officers from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. Some of the Iranian officers had already been stationed in Lebanon, while others reportedly arrived recently following intensified discussion of a possible U.S. military strike against Iran.
According to the sources, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers are not only responsible for restoring Hezbollah’s operational capabilities but are personally overseeing plans and meeting with Hezbollah teams in various regions to issue instructions. The report said the Iranian officers also met with members of the missile unit targeted in Friday’s strike in the Bekaa region.
The sources added: “An Israeli military attack against Hezbollah is inevitable and is only a matter of timing.”
Mahmoud Qamati, a member of Hezbollah’s political council, said Saturday: “Our choice will remain resistance, even if today we show patience. Has the state become convinced that diplomacy and international relations are useless? Our prisoners will not remain in jails and the occupation of our land will not continue.”
Separately, the military confirmed Saturday that there were fatalities in the strikes carried out Friday in the Bekaa Valley. A military spokesperson said forces eliminated “a large number” of terrorists affiliated with Hezbollah’s missile array at three separate command centers.
Lebanese reports said at least 10 people were killed in the strikes, eight of them Hezbollah members.
According to the military, the terrorists were planning to deploy rocket and missile launchers. Fighter jets approached covertly and simultaneously dropped six bombs on the three command centers.
In an unusual move, Hezbollah issued official statements announcing the deaths of its operatives. The organization has refrained for an extended period from formally publishing notices of casualties within its ranks.
Among those killed was “the fighting commander Hussein Mohammed Yaghi, known as Abu Ali Sadeq, born in 1984 in the city of Baalbek, who was killed defending Lebanon and its people as a result of an Israeli strike on the Bekaa region,” according to Hezbollah’s statement.
The other names published were Qassem Ali Mahdi, Ahmad Hussein al-Hajj Hassan, Hussein Khairallah Alaa al-Din, Ali Zeid al-Moussawi, Mohammed Ibrahim al-Moussawi and Ahmad Mohammed Zeaiter.

A record-setting Winter Olympics: 6 golds and 15 medals for the US in women's events set marks
Women are powering Team USA’s medal surge at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, and they are setting records along the way
- Bookmark
The U.S. women's hockey team had just won Olympic gold, and veteran forward Kendall Coyne Schofield summed the moment up perfectly.
“We did it!” she exclaimed.
Plenty of American women — more than ever at a Winter Olympics — had the same sentiment at these Milan Cortina Games.
When it came to winning medals, they indeed did it. And in record numbers, too.
American women — not even counting mixed events — went into Saturday, the next-to-last day of these Olympics, with six golds and 15 medals overall. The previous U.S. winter women's-only marks: five golds (done in 1992, 2002 and 2018) and 13 medals (done in 2014 and 2022).
“Our team is so strong,” Milan Cortina women’s slalom gold medalist and Alpine legend Mikaela Shiffrin said. “We have so many incredible athletes and teammates and friends, and everybody just showed up with so much courage and heart here. And I’m so proud to be part of this American team.”
The count goes to 19 medals for U.S. women from Milan Cortina when adding in mixed competition. More than 40 American women will leave the Games with at least one medal — another winter record for the U.S. And those numbers could keep rising, with some medal chances still left before the cauldrons get extinguished and the Games come to a close.
“Team USA is crushing it and it’s friggin’ sweet,” said U.S. women's bobsledder Kaillie Humphries Armbruster — a bronze medalist in monobob and a contender for another medal in the two-woman event on Saturday night. “Women’s hockey got gold, hell yeah. It's all definitely motivating.”
There was shiny motivation everywhere U.S. women could look.
Shiffrin and downhill winner Breezy Johnson won golds in Alpine skiing, Elana Meyers Taylor won in monobob, Alysa Liu won the figure skating women's singles gold (plus another gold in the team event for both men and women), Elizabeth Lemley took the Olympic title in freestyle moguls and the women's hockey team rallied late to force overtime and then beat Canada for that title. Kaila Kuhn was part of a gold-medal win in mixed team aerials as well — the 11th for Team USA at these Olympics, the most by the Americans in Winter Games history.
The U.S. men have been no slouches in Italy.
But the U.S. women have been record-setting.
“It’s iconic. It’s legendary,” U.S. bobsledder Kaysha Love said. “At the end of the day, I think that’s why we do this.”
In fairness, the games have grown over time, which means more women have gotten the chance to become Olympians. There were 41 events for women (excluding mixed events) at Milan Cortina, compared with 37 at Turin in 2006 and a mere 12 at Lake Placid in 1980.
Still, records are records. And this U.S. Olympic women’s team, as a total group, set a new standard.
The 15 medals for Americans in women's competition at Milan Cortina, and 19 when adding in mixed events, would top the total medals won by all U.S. athletes — men, women and mixed — in every Winter Games from 1924 through 1998.
Freestyle skiing has delivered four of the 15 women's medals for Americans in these Games; Jaelin Kauf got two of those, both silvers in moguls.
“There’s an incredibly strong women’s team and moguls program in the US, (which is) exactly why it’s so good,” Kauf said. “We have become extremely dominant in the last handful of years, continuing to be the best women’s team in the world for four or five years now.”
Clearly, success breeds success. Just ask Cory Thiesse.
She became the first American woman to medal in Olympic curling. Thiesse won silver in mixed doubles with Korey Dropkin and competes for a bronze medal on Saturday in the women’s competition. And Thiesse got there, in part, because she was inspired by past success of others — whether they were in curling or not.
“I know how important it was for me to have girls to look up to when I was growing up, not only in my own sport but other sports out there winning medals and seeing that on TV and dreaming big because of it,” she told the AP on Friday. “So, I just think it’s great for future generations.”
U.S. men's hockey coach Mike Sullivan said the American women who delivered this year are also planting seeds for 2030, 2034 and beyond.
“What a terrific hockey team and they’ll be an inspiration for the next generation of girls growing up in the United States,” Sullivan said after the U.S. women topped Canada for hockey gold. “It’s crazy how far women’s hockey has come in the United States, and a lot of it is due to the teams like this and the girls that play on these teams. They inspire the next generation.”

Hundreds protest in Stockholm to denounce Israel’s latest measures aimed at annexing West Bank
Despite cold weather, people gather at Odenplan Square in central Stockholm in response to calls from several civil society organizations before marching on roads to protest Israel's plans to annex parts of occupied West Bank
Stockholms Lan
- Protesters call for sanctions and urgent action over Gaza humanitarian crisis
STOCKHOLM
Hundreds of people protested in Sweden's capital of Stockholm on Saturday, condemning Israel's latest administrative measures aimed at annexing the occupied West Bank.
Despite the cold weather, people gathered at Odenplan Square in central Stockholm in response to calls from several civil society organizations before marching on the roads to protest Israel's plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.
Protesters voiced opposition to the proposed annexation and called for action over the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
Last Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register Palestinian land in the West Bank as “state property" for the first time since Israel occupied the territory in 1967. According to Israeli Channel 7, the measure includes opening previously frozen land registration procedures, cancelling old Jordanian legislation, and disclosing land records that had remained confidential for decades.
Protesters' chants, including “no to the annexation of the West Bank,” were heard as the crowd marched towards the Swedish parliament and the Foreign Ministry buildings.
Some demonstrators carried placards reading “stop the genocide” and “children are being killed in Gaza.”
Sigyn Meder, a Swedish activist who participated in the rally, said campaigners have been holding weekly demonstrations for over two years.
She described the situation in Gaza as a “humanitarian catastrophe” and urged the Swedish government and the wider international community to adopt a concrete plan of action.
Organizers announced the launch of a new initiative titled “sanctions against Israel,” encouraging supporters to press lawmakers to take a firmer stance.
They said a petition linked to the campaign would be submitted to the Swedish government and parliament.
Israel has previously defended its security policies and military operations as necessary responses to threats from Palestinian armed groups.
Since the war in Gaza began on Oct. 8, 2023, Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, through the army and illegal settlers. These actions include killings, arrests, demolitions, displacement, and settlement expansion.
Israeli operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since October 2023 have killed more than 1,115 Palestinians, injured about 11,500, and led to nearly 22,000 arrests.
The war in Gaza over two years has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians and wounded over 171,000, most of them women and children, and damaged about 90% of civilian infrastructure, according to Palestinian sources.

Police shot a knife-wielding man on Saturday morning in Kalajoki on Finland’s west coast.
Officers were responding to a domestic disturbance report. When the police patrol arrived, a man in the apartment attacked one of the officers with a bladed weapon.
"Police had to use a firearm to carry out the detention," the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.
According to the tabloid Iltalehti, both the police officer and the stabbing suspect were seriously injured in the incident and have been taken to hospital. Kalajoki is in Northern Ostrobothnia, about 130km southwest of Oulu.
Detective Inspector Jarmo Katila from the Oulu NBI unit told the newspaper that according to current information, neither of their injuries were life-threatening.
The middle-aged man who stabbed the officer is suspected of attempted murder. Katila declined to comment on any other possible criminal charges, or whether anyone else was present in the flat at the time.
The preliminary investigation is being conducted by the Oulu branch of the NBI.
"The investigation is in its early stages and more information will be provided later," it said on Saturday.
Because police discharged a weapon during the incident, the Prosecutor General's Office is also investigating the case. Such cases are comparatively rare in Finland.

The bones of St. Francis are going on public display, a mixed blessing for Assisi
Assisi is putting the bones of St. Francis on public display for the first time, and the town is bracing for a huge crush of pilgrims
- Bookmark
The bones of St. Francis of Assisi, the medieval friar who inspired Pope Francis and generations of Christians before him, are going on public display for the first time, giving his hilltop Umbrian hometown yet another reason to welcome pilgrims.
That’s a mixed blessing for Assisi Mayor Valter Stoppini, residents and the Franciscan friars who are organizing the monthlong display of relics to commemorate the 800th anniversary of the saint’s death this year.
Already, nearly 400,000 people have registered to pray before the relics and Stoppini estimates the number could well reach a half-million before the bones go back into their tomb March 22.
A small army of 400 volunteers have been recruited to herd them through the medieval city’s cobblestone streets and into the lower Basilica of St. Francis to view the bones, which are held in a bulletproof glass box.
That will put enormous strain on the city’s center, with its narrow souvenir-lined streets and limited services. But it will also test the patience of Assisi’s residents, who are no stranger to mass influxes of pilgrims, but usually just for limited celebrations.
“We’re used to this kind of event, but that lasts for one, two or three days,” Stoppini said. “This is something prolonged, for a month, so I’m a bit worried, but calm.”
A saint who inspired a pope and many more
As it is, Assisi is one of the world’s most popular Christian pilgrimage destinations, located on a hill in the Umbrian countryside and built with a pink-tinged limestone that gives it its unique glow, especially at sunset.
Millions of pilgrims flock here each year thanks to the presence of St. Francis’ tomb and the spectacular basilica, decorated with Giotto’s frescoes illustrating the saint’s life, that rises over it.
St. Francis was born into a wealthy family in 1182, but renounced his wealth to live as a mendicant friar after receiving what he said was a vocation to rebuild and reform the church.
He is best known for his message of peace, his love of creation and attention to the poor -- teachings that strongly inspired Pope Francis, the first pope to name himself after the saint.
While St. Francis’ remains have been periodically inspected over the years by the Franciscan friars to ensure their conservation, this is the first time they are going on display publicly.
The decision to remove them from the crypt and welcome pilgrims for a month is a means to keep his message alive and give Christians a chance to pray before them, officials said.
Stoppini said a monthlong exhibition was the maximum he could ask of Assisi’s residents given the strain on the city that already saw a massive influx of pilgrims in 2025.
Assisi has a new saint, too
While Assisi is famous for St. Francis, a new saint is drawing a new generation of pilgrims: Carlo Acutis, who was canonized last year by Pope Leo XIV as the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint.
Acutis, who died at age 15 of leukemia, is buried in a different Assisi basilica, but his wild popularity especially among young Latin Americans has turned Assisi into a new religious destination for Catholic youth groups visiting Italy.
“When we go out onto the piazza, we find many people who ask us ‘Where’s Carlo? Where’s Carlo?'” said Brother Marco Moroni, the custodian of the convent of St. Francis.
Last year alone saw a 30% increase in the number of pilgrims, though that was likely due to both Acutis’ canonization and the Holy Year, which brought some 33 million pilgrims to Rome, many of whom also traveled on to Assisi.
“The beautiful thing is that saints don’t go to war against one another, thanks be to God,” he added.
“Many who come to the basilica go to see Carlo, and many who go to Carlo Acutis come to the basilica, creating an osmosis and a growing movement that does though create some problems for the city.”
For the locals, religious tourism is necessary
For the souvenir merchants of Assisi, who make their living off religious tourists and pilgrims who flock to the picturesque town, a monthlong event is welcome.
“Other people will see what we see every day,” with Francis’ spirit imbuing the town, said shopkeeper Arianna Catarinelli, who works in a souvenir shop in the main drag of town leading to the basilica.
The shop features Assisi-emblazoned sweatshirts, pens featuring Acutis’ photo, St. Francis-themed coffee mugs and neon rosaries.
“For residents, finding parking isn’t easy. But for businesses, I think it’s positive that there are so many people,” she said.
To cope with the influx, city hall has created new parking lots outside the city center and runs a shuttle service to bring people into town.
Assisi resident Riccardo Bacconi, who works in a local bank branch, said he hoped the extra parking lots will be the legacy of the exposition that will continue to make life easier for locals.
Speaking after he went for a morning run Saturday, Bacconi acknowledged the town lives from tourism and anyone who chooses to live here has to put up with it.
“I don’t judge it negatively, economically it’s important,” he said. “There are more advantages than disadvantages.”

European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has urged EU governments to rely on “coalitions of the willing” to push through long-stalled economic reforms, arguing the bloc doesn’t need all 27 countries on board to move forward.
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Saturday, Lagarde pointed to the 21-country eurozone as proof that deeper integration can work without full unanimity of the EU member states.
“We do not have the 27 around the table, and yet it works,” she said.

Two Palestinians were killed and five others injured Saturday in Israeli attacks on various areas of Gaza, despite a ceasefire agreement that has been in effect since October 10, 2025.
An elderly Palestinian man was killed when an Israeli drone dropped a bomb on the town of Jabalia in northern Gaza, medical sources told Anadolu.
Shortly before that, a 46-year-old Palestinian man was killed in an Israeli strike targeting the Qizan al-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the same sources said.
Medical sources also reported that a 23-year-old Palestinian woman was shot in the neck by fire from an Israeli drone in the Shejaiya neighbourhood, east of Gaza City.
Earlier, three Palestinians were injured by Israeli gunfire east of Omar al-Mukhtar Street in Shejaiya, with one reported in serious condition, according to medical sources.
In northern Gaza, another Palestinian was wounded in the chest and hand by Israeli gunfire in Jabalia al-Balad, the sources added.
The attacks took place in areas outside Israeli military occupation and deployment as outlined in the ceasefire agreement.
A US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 612 Palestinians and injuring 1,640 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Jordan blasts US envoy Mike Huckabee's Israel can ‘take all Middle East' remark
Jordan has condemned remarks by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee suggesting it would be acceptable for Israel to take control of the entire Middle East, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in the first formal Arab response to the controversy.
In a statement issued on Saturday, Jordan’s Foreign Ministry described Huckabee’s comments as "absurd and provocative, and represent a violation of diplomatic norms, an infringement on the sovereignty of the region’s states, and a clear breach of international law and the United Nations Charter".
The ministry focused on the ongoing Israeli occupation of the West Bank, saying that the remarks "contradict US President Donald Trump’s declared position rejecting the annexation of the occupied West Bank".
It further stressed that "the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip are occupied Palestinian territories under international law".
Huckabee made the comments during a two-hour interview with US commentator Tucker Carlson.
In the interview, Huckabee invoked the Book of Genesis, referring to the passage in which God promises Abraham land "from the River of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates".
Carlson noted that, in modern geographic terms, such a description would encompass "basically the entire Middle East", including the whole of Jordan and Lebanon, most of Syria, and large parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
When pressed on whether Israel had the right to that territory, Huckabee responded: "It would be fine if they took it all."
He also framed his position in religious terms, saying: "Israel is a land that God gave, through Abraham, to a people that he chose. It was a people, a place and a purpose."
Jordan, which shares a long border with Israel and has a peace treaty with it since 1994, has repeatedly warned against annexation of the occupied West Bank, viewing it as a direct threat to regional stability and its own national security.

How to diversify your 401(k) in under an hour
Knowing your risk tolerance and retirement timeline will help make 401(k) diversification easier
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Spreading money across different types of assets and risk levels - aka “diversification” - is a basic principle of investing.
If you have a 401(k) retirement account and haven’t adjusted the portfolio’s risk level and asset mix in a while, don’t worry; the process isn’t difficult. In fact, changes can be made in less than a day, said wealth manager Phil Battin, CEO of Illinois-based Ambassador Wealth Management.
“For those that are more technically savvy, it's usually two to five minutes [of work] unless you want to do a lot of deep dive analysis,” Battin said. “[But], if a person, in general, allocated 15 to 30 minutes…I think that’s more than enough time.”
Following a few simple steps can help investors navigate the diversification process with a little more confidence.
Know thyself
Often, the administrator that runs the 401(k) account will offer diversification options based on risk preference: low, mid and high are common.
If you selected a low-risk portfolio when setting up the account but think it may be time to change that strategy, take a moment to reflect on your risk tolerance, Battin said.
“Every program, whether it’s Fidelity or Principal or Securian or Empower; every one of them have [an option to] identify your risk tolerance,” he said. “So, the first action step is identifying the risk tolerance that you naturally [can] handle. It’s a very simple questionnaire.”
If high-risk investments that experience significant ups and downs cause too much stress, a high-risk portfolio may not be the right fit.
If that’s the case, going with a low- or mid-risk option would be a better fit, most likely.
Know your timeline
Diversifying a portfolio isn’t just about risk tolerance; it’s about how far away retirement is, too, Battin said.
Those who are close to retiring should consider sticking with a lower-risk strategy to avoid any significant losses before they stop working.
Since their 401(k) will likely be used as an income source, steady returns are important for making that income last as long as possible.
However, those who are early in their career can afford to take on riskier assets when they diversify, Battin said.
“[When you] get into the retirement red zone, and that's within five years of retirement … you must be wise and derisk the portfolio,” he said. “If the individual in question is young and is so far from that retirement date … I tell them to be as growth-oriented as possible.”
Make your choices
Once the risk assessment is complete and a strategy based on a retirement timeline is set, diversifying a 401(k) can be done with just a few clicks.
Online accounts typically offer a choice of low-, medium- and high-risk options that the plan’s administrator has already diversified.
Typically, each option offers a fact sheet that shows how the portfolio’s assets are spread out.
The data is something you can skim, or, for those who like to dig into the details, it can be an opportunity to do a deep dive into what’s under the investment hood.
Between the initial risk assessment and choosing a risk level, diversifying a 401(k) could take less than five minutes, Battin said.
Educate yourself
For those who want to take a more active approach to diversification, education is important, Battin said.
Ideally, an educated investor would look at their 401(k) quarterly and make adjustments based on their portfolio growth.
For example, if the portfolio is booming but there are opportunities to buy into other assets and industries that may be at a low point, selling high and exploring those other options might make sense, Battin said.
“An educated investor should always do better than the uneducated investor,” he said. ”Typically, an educated investor is willing to look at their portfolio quarterly and make adjustments to continue to sell high.”
It’s not a guarantee that educated investors will always earn more than those with less investing knowledge. However, those who are more savvy may check their portfolios more often - quarterly, Battin pointed out, as opposed to yearly - and might be able to take advantage of sell-high, buy-low moments.
Fact sheets included with a 401(k)’s risk levels can offer plenty of information. Investors can turn to their plan administrator’s online education resources, too, and ask questions via phone support.
Respected investment firms like Vanguard offer helpful learning material online. The Securities and Exchange Commission offers an introductory education about investing, too.

Former US army veteran opposes Ohio bill targeting Israel criticism as antisemitism
Ohio bill adopting antisemitism definition draws fire from 17-year US Army veteran Josephine Guilbeau, who warns it could criminalize criticism of Israel and threaten free speech
- Bill faces pushback from free speech groups, interfaith coalitions, and over 100 Jewish Ohio residents who signed opposition letters.
ANKARA
A proposed bill in US state of Ohio is drawing controversy, including from an army veteran, for adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which critics say could criminalize some protests and criticisms of Israel.
Josephine Guilbeau, a 17-year US Army veteran and former intelligence officer, strongly opposed the legislation during her testimony before the Ohio Senate Judiciary Committee.
She said: “Under this bill, anyone, even Jews speaking against Zionist actions, could be criminalized.”
Guilbeau warned that passage of the bill would endanger freedoms in the US, adding: “No law you enact can silence believers. No law can erase the word 'God' from our hearts.”
The bill would adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism into Ohio law.
Critics argue it could equate criticism of Israeli policies including accusations of genocide in Palestine with antisemitism, potentially chilling free speech, protests, and academic discussion.
The bill directs state agencies to use this definition in discrimination cases and broadens ethnic intimidation laws.
This is an Ohio-specific measure, not a nationwide law. Over 35 other states have adopted or recognized the IHRA definition in various forms, often for education or anti-discrimination purposes.
The proposal has faced pushback from free speech groups, interfaith coalitions, and over 100 Jewish Ohio residents who signed letters opposing it.
Supporters say it helps combat rising antisemitism. The bill remains in committee.

'Heavy', 'sad' and 'increasingly intense' atmosphere at rally for killed far-right activist
Several hundreds joined a march organised by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
Reporting from Lyon, FRANCE 24's Olivia Bizot said the atmosphere was "heavy, sad and increasingly intense", adding that "several young men carrying wooden sticks" were present at the rally.

Around 3,200 people marched in France's southeastern city of Lyon on Saturday in memory of a far-right activist whose killing has been blamed on the hard left, according to estimates by the prefecture for the region.
The rally, widely publicised online by ultra-nationalist and far-right groups, had been expected to draw thousands of people and was held under heavy security, with authorities fearing clashes with left-wing protesters.

Many political slogans chanted
“The far left kills,” “LFI accomplices, anti-fascist assassins,” and “Young guard in prison, free the city of Lyon.”

Several far-right fringe groups present at the march
The call to join the march was widely shared on social media by far-right fringe groups including the “national-revolutionary” Allobroges Bourgoin, the feminist collective Némésis, the “national-identitarian” group Audace Lyon, and the monarchist, nationalist and anti-republican movement Action française.
Before the procession set off, a tribute to Quentin Deranque was held at the traditionalist Church of Saint-Georges, where services are conducted in Latin and which the young man attended.
Hundreds march in Lyon to protest far-right activist's killing
Several hundreds joined a march organised by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of the tribute to Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers next week to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate,” he said. “There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising.”
The main tribute to Deranque took place in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Their fighting often takes the form of organised street battles in the city, sometimes involving groups of several dozen people.
Lyon’s far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque’s parents also called for calm and did not take part in the tribute, which was not banned by French authorities.

Heavy police presence is expected at a rally Saturday for a far-right activist who was killed last week in Lyon according to the French interior minister. FRANCE 24's Oliva Bizot reports.

'I don't want Lyon to be the capital of the far right,' says Mayor Grégory Doucet
"I don't want Lyon to be the capital of the far right," declared Lyon Green Party mayor Grégory Doucet on Saturday before a march in tribute to radical far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
"First and foremost, it is the city of Jean Moulin, the capital of the Resistance," he said to the press, adding that national and municipal police will ensure vigilance in his city.
Watch: France on edge ahead of far-right rally
Some two to three thousand people are expected to attend a march Saturday in Lyon for a far-right activist killed last week. With ultra-right groups expected to attend the march, tensions are high with President Emmanuel Macron urging calm. FRANCE 24's Olivia Bizot reports from Lyon.
France's radical right uses Deranque’s death to target far-left
Quentin Deranque’s death has triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming the far-left France Unbowed party and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a France Unbowed lawmaker who set up the anti-fascist group The Young Guard.
France Unbowed’s opponents accuse it of fomenting violence and tensions with its combative far-left politics.
Mélenchon has condemned the violence and insisted that his party bore no blame for the tragedy.
The France Unbowed leader stood for the presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022, but failed to advance to the decisive runoff round. He is preparing for another expected run next year, when Macron’s second and last term ends.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonise France Unbowed. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party.
The National Rally has worked for years to shed its reputation as being racist and anti-Semitic and to present itself as a bulwark of institutional credibility.
In a message to party officials before Saturday's march, Bardella urged them to avoid the nationwide rallies, where potential confrontations could reinforce the negative image it is trying to shed.
"The far left's desire for confrontation with these gatherings appears undiminished. Some organisers, undeniably linked to the ultra-right and whom we refuse to associate with... are also seeking confrontation," he wrote.
"We have paid a dignified tribute to Quentin and are fully assuming the political role that the French people - shocked and outraged by this tragedy - expect from us."
He said the killing allows the National Rally to say: "'We respect institutions. There are people who are afraid of us coming to power; they kill our supporters.'"
Rhone authorities will not tolerate 'any incidents' during the march, prefect says
The prefect of Rhone, the east-central French administrative department of which Lyon is capital, has said authorities will not tolerate “any incidents” during the rally for far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of the march, Rhone Prefect Fabienne Buccio said authorities “will not tolerate any incidents within the procession” nor “on the fringes of this march”.
Security measures, which have been stepped up for the march, include additional personnel and two drones, said Buccio which “will remain in place, including in the evening,” she added.

Palestine denounces US envoy’s remarks on Israeli rule over Middle East
Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemns comments by Mike Huckabee as incitement to expansionism that contradict international law and President Trump’s stated opposition to West Bank annexation
RAMALLAH, Palestine
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry on Saturday said comments by the US ambassador to Israel suggesting acceptance of Israeli control over the entire Middle East amount to “an explicit call to violate the sovereignty of states.”
Speaking to journalist Tucker Carlson, Huckabee this week argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying: "It would be fine if they took it all.”
In a statement, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned the remarks, saying they “contradict religious and historical facts and international law,” and also contradict statements by US President Donald Trump rejecting annexation of the occupied West Bank.
The ministry said the “provocative” comments represent “an explicit call to violate the sovereignty of states.”
The remarks, it added, provide support for Israel to continue a war of genocide and displacement and to pursue annexation and expansion plans against the Palestinian people – steps it said have been rejected by the international community, which considers the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, occupied Palestinian territory under international law.
The ministry called on the US to take a clear and explicit position on Huckabee’s statements and to reaffirm the positions announced by Trump regarding achieving peace in the Middle East, ending wars and violence, and rejecting Israeli annexation of the West Bank.
It said the comments “do not help achieve President Trump’s vision for lasting peace in the Middle East.”
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel last April, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a “Greater Israel.” He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission” including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
“Greater Israel” is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Iraq bloc may drop Maliki from PM nomination after US threats
Iraq’s ruling Coordination Framework coalition is moving towards abandoning Nouri al-Maliki’s bid for prime minister following US pressure and internal divisions, according to senior political sources.
The shift comes after what Iraq’s Foreign Ministry described on Thursday as "verbal" US messages rejecting Maliki’s nomination and warning of possible sanctions targeting Iraqi individuals and institutions, as well as a potential reassessment of relations with Baghdad.
The ministry issued the statement to clarify remarks made by Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein to a local television channel.
Senior sources within the Coordination Framework told The New Arab's sister outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that "movement has already begun over the past two days to abandon Maliki by reconsidering the decision and creating new conditions to discuss the post".
The sources said Maliki had indicated he would only withdraw if two-thirds of the alliance agreed to remove him, stating that "Maliki has confirmed he is prepared to step aside if two-thirds of the Framework alliance agree to remove him".
The nomination, approved by an internal majority vote within the pro-Iran alliance, has caused divisions among its leadership. Parties within the bloc are now seeking what sources described as a new formula to reverse the decision.
Political sources from the alliance told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that "the number of political forces rejecting Maliki has increased over the past two days, with some rallying around the issue of Iraq’s supreme national interest following the US threats".
They added that "leaders of the Coordination Framework are seriously considering removing Maliki from the race for prime minister, but in a polite manner that does not anger the Islamic Dawa Party or push it to withdraw from political life or refuse to participate in the next government".
According to the same sources, a shortlist of four alternative names is under discussion. Among them is National Intelligence Service chief Hamid al-Shatri, described as the frontrunner due to his relations across the political spectrum and cooperation with international intelligence agencies, "especially the United States".
The sources also said current Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani is seeking another term, but that most forces do not support him. Basra Governor Asaad al-Eidani is also reportedly being considered.
They indicated that Ammar al-Hakim, Qais al-Khazali, Haider al-Abadi, and increasingly Hadi al-Amiri, along with Hammam Hamoudi, are leaning toward withdrawing Maliki’s nomination to avoid internal disputes and possible US sanctions.
However, officials from Maliki’s State of Law Coalition rejected reports of a retreat.
Hisham al-Rikabi, director of the coalition’s office, said reports of withdrawing Maliki’s candidacy were "claims and a malicious media campaign aimed at confusing public opinion". He said the Coordination Framework "remains committed to its declared political positions and to its candidate for the next phase".
Hussein al-Sadiq, a member of the coalition, said "the current media pressure aimed at isolating Maliki or pushing him to withdraw will not succeed", stressing that the nomination was a decision of the Coordination Framework, which he described as the largest parliamentary bloc.
He added that discussion of withdrawal would only take place if agreed within the alliance, saying it was illogical for Iraq to "submit to tweets and social media posts, whether from US President Donald Trump or anyone else".
Last month, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: "The last time Maliki was in power, the country sank into poverty and massive chaos. That must not happen again… Because of his policies and crazy ideologies, if he is elected, the United States will not provide any future assistance to Iraq."
Political analyst Talal al-Jubouri told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the Coordination Framework is "in a bind and embarrassed" over Maliki’s nomination. He said some factions are seriously considering sidelining him to prevent further US intervention in Iraqi affairs.
Al-Jubouri warned that maintaining Maliki’s candidacy could place the Shia alliance in "an open and direct confrontation" with the US administration, particularly amid US demands regarding Iraqi armed factions and ties with Iran.

Bill Mazeroski, the Hall of Fame second baseman who won eight Gold Glove awards for his steady work in the field and the hearts of countless Pittsburgh Pirates fans for his historic walk-off home run in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, has died at the age of 89.
Pirates owner Bob Nutting said “Maz was one of a kind, a true Pirates legend. ... His name will always be tied to the biggest home run in baseball history and the 1960 World Series championship, but I will remember him most for the person he was: humble, gracious and proud to be a Pirate.”
Mazeroski died Friday, the Pirates said. No cause of death was given.
‘Defensive wizard’
Elected to the Hall by the Veterans Committee in 2001, he was, by some measures, no superstar. Mazeroski had the lowest batting average, on-base percentage and stolen base total of any second baseman in Cooperstown. He hit just .260 lifetime, with 138 homers and 27 stolen bases in 17 years, and had an on-base percentage of .299. He never batted .300, never approached 100 runs batted or 100 runs scored and only once finished in the top 10 for Most Valuable Player.
His best qualities were both tangible and beyond the box score. His Hall of Fame plaque praises him as a “defensive wizard” with “hard-nosed hustle” and a “quiet work ethic.” A 10-time All-Star, he turned a major league record 1,706 double plays, earning the nickname “No Hands” for how quickly he fielded grounders and relayed them. He led the National League nine times in assists for second basemen and has been cited by statistician Bill James as the game’s greatest defensive player at his position — by far.
“I think defense belongs in the Hall of Fame,” Mazeroski said, defensively, during his Hall of Fame induction speech. “Defense deserves as much credit as pitching and I’m proud to be going in as a defensive player.”
A home run for the ages
Mazeroski’s signature moment took place in the batter’s box, as the square-jawed, tobacco-chewing Mazeroski, a coal miner’s son from West Virginia, lived out the dream of so many kids who thought of playing professional ball.
The Pirates had not reached the World Series since 1927, when they were swept by the New York Yankees, and again faced the Yankees in 1960. While New York was led by Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, Pittsburgh had few prominent names beyond a young Roberto Clemente. They relied on hitters ranging from shortstop Dick Groat to outfielder Bob Skinner, and the starting pitchers Vernon Law and Bob Friend. Mazeroski, who turned 24 that September, finished the season with a .273 average and usually batted eighth.
The series told one story in the runs column and another in wins and losses. The Yankees outscored the Pirates 55-27, and 38-3 in the three games they won. Mazeroski’s counterpart on New York, Bobby Richardson, drove in a record 12 runs and was named the series’ MVP — even though he was on the losing team. Whitey Ford shut out the Pirates twice, on his way to a then-record 33 2/3 straight scoreless World Series innings for the Yankees ace.
The Pirates’ first three wins weren’t nearly so spectacular, but they were wins — and Mazeroski helped. He hit a 2-run homer in the fourth inning off the Yankees’ Jim Coates in Game 1, a 6-4 Pirate victory, and a 2-run double in the second inning off Art Ditmar in Game 5, a 5-2 Pittsburgh win. In Game 7, he saved his big hit for the end.
Some 36,000 fans at Pittsburgh’s Forbes Field, and many more tuning in on radio and television, agonized through one of the Fall Classic’s wildest and most emotional conclusions. The lead changed back and forth as Pittsburgh scored the game’s first four runs, only to fall behind as the Yankees rallied in the middle innings and went ahead 7-4 in the top of the eighth. Pittsburgh retook the lead with five runs in the bottom of the eighth, helped in part by a seeming double-play grounder that took a bad hop and struck Yankees shortstop Tony Kubek in the throat. But the Yankees came right back and tied the score at 9 in the top of the ninth.
The bottom of the ninth has been relived, not always by choice, by the two teams and by generations of fans. The New York pitcher was Ralph Terry, a right hander whom manager Casey Stengel had brought in during the previous inning and would later acknowledge that he had a tired arm. The right-handed hitting Mazeroski, who had grounded into a double play in his previous appearance, was up first.
Terry started with a fastball, called high for a ball. After conferring briefly with catcher Johnny Blanchard, who reminded him to keep his pitches down, he threw what Mazeroski would call a slider that didn’t slide. Mazeroski got under it and belted it to left, the ball rising and rising as it cleared the high, ivy-covered brick wall, with Yankees left fielder Yogi Berra circling under it, then turning away in defeat. The whole city seemed to erupt, as if all had swung the bat with him, as if he were every underdog who longed to beat the hated Yankees. Mazeroski dashed around the bases, grinning and waving his cap, joined by celebrants from the stands who had rushed onto the field and followed him to home plate, where his teammates embraced him.
“I was just looking to get on base,″ he told The New York Times in 1985. ″Nothing fancy, just looking for a fastball until he got a strike on me. I thought it would be off the wall, and I wanted to make third if the ball ricocheted away from Berra. But when I got around first and was digging for second, I saw the umpire waving circles above his head and I knew it was over.”
It was the first time a World Series had ended on a homer, leading to enduring waves of celebration and despair. Pirates followers memorized the date, Saturday, Oct. 13, 1960, and the local time of Mazeroski’s hit, 3:36 p.m. Forbes Field was torn down in the 1970s, but a decade later fans began gathering every Oct. 13 at the park’s lone remnant, the center field wall, and listened to the original broadcast.
Meanwhile, Mantle would sob on the plane ride home in 1960, insisting the better team had lost. Ford would for years remain angry at Stengel — fired five days after the Series — for using him in Games 3 and 6 and making him unavailable to start a third time. The late singer Bing Crosby, a former co-owner of the Pirates, was so afraid he’d jinx his team that he listened to the game with friends across the Atlantic Ocean, in Paris.
“We were in this beautiful apartment, listening on shortwave, and when it got close Bing opened a bottle of Scotch and was tapping it against the mantel,” his widow, Kathryn Crosby, told the Times in 2010. “When Mazeroski hit the home run, he tapped it hard; the Scotch flew into the fireplace and started a conflagration.”
A team player
Mazeroski was a Pirate for his entire time in the majors and was a team man off the field. His wife, Milene Nicholson, was a front office employee whom he met through Pittsburgh manager Danny Murtaugh. They were married in 1958, had two sons and remained together until her death in 2024.
William Stanley Mazeroski was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, during the Great Depression, grew up in eastern Ohio, and lived for a time in a one-room house without electricity or indoor plumbing. His father, Louis Mazeroski, had hoped himself to be a ballplayer and encouraged his son’s love for sports, even practicing with him by having his son field tennis balls thrown against a brick wall.
Although a star in basketball and football, he favored baseball and was good enough to be drafted by the Pirates at age 17 in 1954. Mazeroski was a shortstop for a team with numerous prospects at that position, and had switched to second by his rookie year, 1956. Even as a part-time player at the end of his career, he was a leader and steady presence on the 1971 team that featured Clemente and Willie Stargell and defeated the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series.
After his final season, 1972, Mazeroski coached briefly for the Pirates and the Seattle Mariners and was an infield instructor for Pittsburgh during spring training. In 1987, the Pirates retired his uniform, No. 9. The 50th anniversary of his Game 7 heroics was marked in 2010 by the unveiling — on Bill Mazeroski Way — of a 14-foot, 2,000-pound statue of one of Pittsburgh’s greats, rounding the bases, on top of the world.

Iran’s IRGC Navy tests Sayyad-3G air defense missile in Strait of Hormuz drill
Missile has vertical launch capability and 150-kilometer range
ISTANBUL
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Navy has tested the Sayyad-3G air defense missile for the first time during the “Smart Control” drills in the Strait of Hormuz.
According to an Anadolu correspondent, the IRGC Navy on Saturday released footage showing the launch of the naval version of the land-based Sayyad-3 air defense system, known as the Sayyad-3G, from the vessel Shahid Sayyad Shirazi.
The Sayyad-3G missile features vertical launch capability and has a reported range of 150 kilometers (93 miles). Iranian authorities said the system enables the establishment of a regional air defense umbrella for military vessels of the Shahid Soleimani class.
Iran first tested the long-range, land-based Sayyad-3 air defense missile on Dec. 28, 2016.
The land-based version has a range of 120 kilometers, a length of six meters, and a weight of 900 kilograms.
The “Smart Control” drills in the Strait of Hormuz began on Feb.16 and lasted three days.

Key Russian defense electronics facility ablaze in Mordovia

Key Russian defense electronics facility ablaze in Mordovia
This was reported by The Moscow Times, as cited by Ukrinform.
Initially, the regional branch of Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry said the fire broke out near a defense-industry facility belonging to the Saransk Instrument-Making Plant, without naming the cause. The fire engulfed one workshop covering about 150 square meters. Two hours later, the Emergency Ministry reported that the blaze had been localized and said no injuries were reported.
Local media suggested that a warehouse at the facility had caught fire. No other official details have been released so far. Authorities declared a drone alert in the region earlier in the morning, although Russia’s Defense Ministry did not report any drones being shot down over Mordovia in its morning briefing.
According to other reports, the fire occurred on the premises of Elektrovypryamitel, one of Russia’s largest manufacturers of power electronics for the needs of the Russian Armed Forces. Local residents told the Telegram channel Astra that a fire had broken out at the plant, suggesting it may have been hit by drones.
After analyzing eyewitness footage, Astra concluded that Elektrovypryamitel was indeed the site of the fire. In addition to producing specialized electrical equipment, the company is licensed to develop and assemble power semiconductor devices for weapons and military hardware under Russia’s “Military Register” system, and it also holds official authorization from Russia’s nuclear watchdog to design and manufacture equipment for nuclear power plants.
The enterprise is under sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, New Zealand, and Japan for its involvement in Russia’s state defense orders.
Citing NASA satellite data, Astra also reported a fire at the Neftegorsk Gas Processing Plant following a UAV attack in Russia’s Samara region. Local authorities said the attack targeted “two industrial sites.” The Neftegorsk plant processes associated petroleum gas and plays a key role in hydrocarbon utilization in the region. It is part of the structure of Rosneft.
According to Radio Liberty, cited by Astra, “the main version” is that the strike was carried out with a Flamingo missile – the same type reportedly used in the attack on the Votkinsk missile plant.
On Saturday, head of the Almetyevsk district in the Republic of Tatarstan Guzel Khabutdinova reported a “massive drone attack,” saying UAVs attempted to strike industrial facilities. Astra reported that residents spotted drones about 600 meters from the Radiopribor plant in Almetyevsk, which produces electronic systems for aviation. Khabutdinova later said air defenses had “neutralized” the threat and that industrial operations in the district were not disrupted.
Drones were also shot down over the Yelabuga district, home to Russia’s largest production facility for Geran drones, which are used to attack Ukraine, according to district head Rustem Nuriyev.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, during the night of February 21 a plant in the city of Votkinsk, in Russia’s Udmurt Republic, which manufactures Iskander and Oreshnik ballistic missiles, was attacked.

An Olympic pin more precious than gold celebrates the late halfpipe pioneer, Sarah Burke
The most precious pin at the Milan Cortina Games celebrates an athlete who helped lead an entire sport into the Olympics, but never got to compete herself
- Bookmark
Maybe the most precious pin at the Milan Cortina Games celebrates an athlete who helped lead an entire sport into the Olympics, but never got to compete herself.
Canada's late, great freeskier Sarah Burke was a pioneer in the women's halfpipe. She encouraged girls and young women to jump into what was, decades ago, almost exclusively a men's sport. Later, her lobbying was key to getting the event onto the Olympic program.
But she died at age 29 in a training accident in 2012, two years before the skiers debuted in the halfpipe at the Sochi Olympics.
To honor Burke's memory, Canada coach Trennon Paynter had 200 pins made that spell out “Sarah” in red script — matching the look of the stickers skiers put on their helmets in Russia.
“She got women into the sport, period,” Paynter said Friday. “And then she was a huge driver of getting the sport into the Games by actively attending (International Ski Federation) events when a lot of people didn’t know that was the pathway into the Olympics.”
To this day, Paynter said, some still ski with those “Sarah” stickers on their helmets. But because of the unforgiving Olympic rules that forbid those sorts of displays (see the Ukrainian skeleton racer ), Paynter came up with a different way to spread the message.
He was given the floor before the first halfpipe practice earlier this week and used the time to speak about Burke's impact. He told the athletes about the pins. Word spread quickly across the snowpark. He was out within hours.
“Everyone in this sport, not only this sport but action sport in general, is still really paying tribute to Sarah and her legacy,” said the coach, who plans on having a new batch made and selling them to benefit Burke's charitable foundation.
On Saturday night, Eileen Gu was scheduled to drop into the halfpipe trying to win her second straight gold medal in the event. Gu's birthday: Sept. 3, the same as Burke's.
Arguably the most memorable night in this sport's Olympic history was its first night — in the mountains of Russia where Burke's parents and husband attended the women's contest and watched the slip crew descend the halfpipe for the final time that night in the shape of a heart.
Paynter himself spread some of Burke's ashes above the halfpipe at the Rosa Khutor extreme park.
French skier Marie Martinod won the silver medal that night. She had retired and had a daughter when, one day, Burke knocked on her door and told her she needed to come back because she wanted the best women out there for the Olympic debut.
Martinod painted snowflakes on her fingernails that night to match the tattoo Burke had on her foot.
“I think I didn’t say goodbye to Sarah yet and I still have to do it, and now I feel I’m able to do it because I did what she asked me to do," Martinod said that evening.
Twelve years later, the number of skiers who knew Burke had dwindled to a precious few. Virtually everyone, though, knows her legacy.
American Nick Goepper wore the pin — even pointing at it while he waited for his score in the holding area — during Friday's qualifying round.
“She was a commanding personality and force to legitimize halfpipe skiing for both men and women,” Goepper said. “She gave a lot of inspiration for a lot of young girls.”

Jordan, Egypt condemn US ambassador’s remarks supporting Israel control over Middle East
Mike Huckabee argues Israel has biblical right to land stretching from Nile to Euphrates rivers, saying ‘It would be fine if they took it all’
AMMAN, Jordan / ISTANBUL
Jordan and Egypt on Saturday strongly condemned as "absurd and provocative" and contrary to international law the remarks made by US Ambassador to Tel Aviv Mike Huckabee, in which he openly accepted Israel's control over the entire Middle East, including the occupied West Bank.
Mike Huckabee argued that Israel has a biblical right to the land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates rivers, saying on a podcast released Friday: "It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all.”
Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, during which he defended Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip and voiced support for the idea of “divine providence” giving control of the region to Israel.
After Huckabee claimed Israel had a divine right to vast portions of the Middle East, Carlson asked him: “What land are you talking about?” Interpretations of the biblical phrase “river of Egypt” vary, with some scholars identifying it as a riverbed in the Sinai Peninsula and others as the Nile.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee replied, referring to Israel’s biblical right to the territory stretching from the Nile River to the Euphrates.
In a statement, Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called the remarks “absurd and provocative,” saying they “constitute a violation of diplomatic norms, an infringement on the sovereignty of states in the region, and a blatant breach of international law and the UN Charter.”
The ministry added that the comments “contradict the publicly declared position of US President Donald Trump rejecting annexation of the occupied West Bank.”
The ministry called for “the concerted efforts of all parties to consolidate stability in Gaza and to implement the US president’s plan and UN Security Council Resolution 2803, instead of issuing absurd, escalatory, irresponsible statements that carry no legal value or effect.”
Egypt’s Foreign Ministry condemned the statements, describing them as a “flagrant departure” from the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
Cairo expressed surprise at the remarks, saying they contradict the vision put forward by US President Trump and the related 20-point framework aimed at ending the war in the Gaza Strip, as well as the outcomes of a Board of Peace conference held in Washington on Feb. 19.
Egypt reiterated that Israel has no sovereignty over occupied Palestinian land or any other Arab territories, stressing its categorical rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank, separate it from the Gaza Strip, or expand settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Huckabee, named US ambassador to Israel in April 2025, is an evangelical Christian who has previously spoken of expansionist claims based on what he described as a “divine right” for Israel in the West Bank.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told news channel i24 last August that he feels “very attached” to the vision of a Greater Israel. He said he considers himself “on a historic and spiritual mission” including “generations of Jews that dreamt of coming here and generations of Jews who will come after us.”
Greater Israel is a term used in Israeli politics to refer to the expansion of Israel’s territory to include the West Bank, Gaza and Syria’s Golan Heights, with some interpretations also including Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula and parts of Jordan.

Trump administration keeping underage pregnant migrants in a single Texas shelter where abortion is outlawed: report
Children as young as 13 are ‘trapped’ in a state with no access to abortion, lawyers and advocates say
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump’s administration is concentrating all pregnant children being held in federal immigration enforcement custody into one group shelter in south Texas, a state where abortion is outlawed with no exceptions for survivors of rape or incest.
Since last summer, more than a dozen pregnant minors, some as young as 13 years old, have been moved to a facility in San Benito along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a joint investigation by The Texas Newsroom and The California Newsroom, citing sources within the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health and Human Services.
The agency is responsible for children who entered the United States without a parent or legal guardian or who were separated from their families by immigration authorities.
Their detention at the Texas facility deviates from longstanding federal policy, which has typically placed unaccompanied minors into ORR shelters or foster homes that can handle high-risk pregnancies.
But legal advocates and care providers fear the administration has concentrated those girls into a poorly equipped Texas shelter, even if they were detained in other states, to ensure they are denied access to abortion care.
“It’s not a coincidence that the Trump administration is sending young pregnant girls to be detained in a state where abortion is banned,” according to Liz Wagner, senior federal policy counsel for the Center for Reproductive Rights.
“It’s beyond cruel to trap these girls — some who are victims of sexual assault — in a state where they have no choice over whether to remain pregnant and become mothers,” she told The Independent. “Everyone deserves the right to make these fundamental decisions for themselves.”
The facility has been operated by contractor Urban Strategies since December 2021.
Between January 2021 and January 2025, at least 136 pregnant unaccompanied children were detained there, The Independent has learned.
In July, ORR’s acting director Angie Salazar — a former Immigration and Customs Enforcement official — instructed ORR to place “any pregnant children into the San Benito program moving forward,” according to an email obtained by media outlets.
“It is imperative that all children in care are afforded access to high-quality healthcare services, which includes reproductive health services,” said Wendy Young, president of Kids In Need of Defense, which provides support for unaccompanied children.
“Pregnant and parenting youth have unique needs and vulnerabilities and should never be prevented from accessing or requesting healthcare services,” she told The Independent. “Policy choices designed to thwart such access, including by potentially transferring children to facilities or locations with limited services, pose grave danger.”
ORR “works to ensure the safety, well-being, and appropriate care of all unaccompanied alien children in its custody,” the agency said in a statement to The Independent.
The agency “follows child welfare best practices to place each child, including those who are pregnant or parenting, in the least restrictive and most integrated setting that meets the child’s best interest and specific needs,” according to ORR.
President Joe Biden’s administration directed ORR to move girls who wanted to end their pregnancies to facilities in states where abortion access was still legal in the aftermath of the 2022 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v Wade and opened the floodgates for anti-abortion states to deny access to care.
But after Trump returned to the White House, he issued an executive order to “to end the forced use of federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion,” and the Department of Justice determined that the government cannot move detainees from one state or another to facilitate abortion access, except in cases of rape or incest or to save the life of the pregnant patient.
Last month, ORR submitted a proposal to revoke the Biden-era policy altogether.
The number of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody is unclear, though data from reporting, lawsuits and congressional reports suggests dozens were detained by immigration authorities within the last year.
That figure should be zero; ICE’s internal policy states that the agency “should not detain, arrest, or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum, or nursing” except in exceptional circumstances.
Women have reported being denied prenatal care and a lack of access to essential items including breast pumps and adequate food and water, all while being shackled, handcuffed and separated from their families and children.
Lawsuits from pregnant women seeking their release from ICE detention routinely appear on court dockets.
Last month, a federal judge in Minnesota rebuked the administration’s detention of a legally admitted refugee who was still breastfeeding her five-month-old.
“There is something particularly craven about transferring a nursing refugee mother out-of-state,” wrote District Judge Michael Davis, who said the mother “lost important bonding and nursing time with her baby” due to a detention he had already deemed illegal.
Last week, in Texas, a woman who said she was forcefully removed from her car and arrested at gunpoint last month before she was sent to an El Paso detention center was granted a hearing to challenge her threat of removal from the country. She is five months pregnant.
And in Louisiana, a judge denied the release of an asylum-seeking woman who was arrested in Massachusetts in December. She is 14 weeks pregnant.
ICE has moved more than 400 children into ORR shelters since Trump returned to the White House, launching what advocates who spoke to The Independent have called an “unprecedented” return of Trump’s notorious family separation policy by targeting families who have lived in the United States for years.
Advocates fear those arrests are forcing parents to make impossible decisions that have ripped apart households.
Homeland Security officials have repeatedly insisted that the administration is not splitting up families, and that deported parents have the option to either leave with their children or place them with a guardian in the United States.

France’s Michelon wins Olympic gold in women’s biatholon mass start, teammate Simon takes silver
France's Océane Michelon and Julia Simon won gold and silver respectively in the women's biathlon 12.5-kilometre mass start race the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on Saturday. Czech biathlete Tereza Vobornikova had to settle for bronze after being overtaken by the French powerhouse team, finishing 7.4 seconds behind Michelon.
In the final biathlon event of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, France's Océane Michelon overcame a missed target in the final shooting stage in the 12.5-kilometre mass start race to take gold.
In heavy snow and low visibility, Michelon left the range in fourth place but moved ahead on the ski trails to complete the five laps in 37 minutes, 18.1 seconds.
Michelon's teammate, Julia Simon, also moved up in the final 2.5 kilometres, crossing the finish line 6.6 seconds back and securing the silver medal. Czech biathlete Tereza Vobornikova had been leading after the final shooting but had to settle for bronze after being overtaken by the French powerhouse team, finishing 7.4 seconds behind Michelon.
Anna Magnusson of Sweden, the only biathlete to hit all 20 of her targets, finished fourth, 26.6 seconds back.
Italy's Dorothea Wierer, favoured by the fans who roared with excitement each time she hit a target, missed two, and at one point was sitting in 16th place, but she cleaned her last standing shooting and crossed the line 30 seconds back in fifth place.
Wierer, who turns 36 in April, had announced her plans to retire after these Olympics, along with Germany's Franziska Preuss, who finished 28th with seven misses. Wierer and Preuss held small flags and skied a short loop together in front of the packed stands, and then celebrated their final race with champagne.

Olympic mass start defending champion Justine Braisaz-Bouchet of France finished a disappointing 27th place, 3:12.2 back, after missing six targets.
Only the top 30 biathletes compete in the mass start race – based on World Cup rankings and Olympic performance. They ski five, 2.5-kilometer loops, shooting twice in the prone position and twice standing.
Anne Buenemann de Besche was the first Danish female biathlete to qualify for an Olympic mass start. She finished in 29th place.

‘They were mothers, wives, friends’: how a ski trip turned deadly in the California mountains
Unknown

15:00:11 UTC
00:00:11 KST

The ringing of a phone echoed through the Nevada county, California, sheriff’s office just before noon on 17 February.
The 911 call brought devastating news: an avalanche had occurred on nearby Castle Peak – a 9,110ft (2,780-meter) mountain north of the Donner summit in the Lake Tahoe area. A group of backcountry skiers had been on the mountainside, returning home from a three-day expedition, during a heavy winter storm. While six had survived, more than half their group was missing.
The ensuing rescue mission in harrowing conditions would bring those six home. In the additional days since the disaster unfolded, family and friends have shared glimpses of the tight-knit group of women, all experienced skiers, whose backcountry excursion took a deadly turn, becoming one of the worst avalanche disasters in US history.
After receiving the emergency call, the sheriff’s office quickly marshaled a team of 46 first responders. But the conditions outside remained treacherous. The University of California, Berkeley’s Central Sierra Snow Lab, near Donner Pass, reported 28in of snow that day, with another 3ft expected in the next two days. The risk of another avalanche occurring during the rescue effort was high.
At first, the sheriff’s office believed 16 people had been in the group trapped on the mountainside: 12 clients and four guides with an expedition group called Blackbird Mountain Guides. But when they arrived on the scene, Blackbird told them that one person had decided to back out of the trip “last minute”, according to the Nevada county sheriff Shannan Moon. Among the missing was the spouse of one of the search-and-rescue volunteers.
The Blackbird group had been on a backcountry ski trip, sleeping two nights at the Frog Lake ski huts – upscale cabins equipped with heaters, wall sockets and bathrooms – before returning to the trailhead on the third day, when the avalanche hit.
Amid the ongoing storm, ski rescue teams headed out into the field onboard a Sno-Cat, a truck-sized vehicle equipped with tank-like tracks that allow it to navigate polar conditions. By 5.30pm, the rescue team had reached a location about 2 miles from where beacons told them the surviving skiers were sheltering. First responders skied the remaining 2 miles of mountainous terrain until they reached the six survivors.
In the hours since the avalanche had occurred, the survivors had built a shelter out of tarps and managed to uncover the bodies of three of their group members. First responders found five additional bodies. One person’s remains are still unaccounted for.
It took several more hours to get the group off the mountain. At a press conference the following day, Placer county sheriff Wayne Woo implored the public to stay off the Sierras as the storm continued. “Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home,” he said. The recovery was expected to last into the weekend.
‘They cherished time together in the mountains’
With eight skiers confirmed dead and one still missing, the Castle Peak avalanche is now the fourth deadliest in US history. In its wake, details are beginning to emerge about the deceased – the majority, a group of mothers and close friends from the Bay Area.
In a statement, the families of six of the deceased identified them as Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, of the Bay Area, Idaho and the Lake Tahoe area. Two of the women – Sekar and Clabaugh – were sisters.
“They were passionate, skilled skiers who cherished time together in the mountains,” the families said.
The families added that the six were part of a group of eight friends, indicating two of the survivors were among the group who went on the trip. They were experienced backcountry skiers “fully equipped with avalanche safety equipment”, the families said.
Max Perrey, mayor of Mill Valley, a town north of San Francisco, acknowledged that some of the women were residents of the city in a statement to the Marin Independent Journal, calling it “a huge tragedy and a huge loss”.
School district officials there said authorities were preparing to support students whose mothers may be among the dead. At least one of the victims was the mother of two children in the Kentfield school district, according to local media.
Three of the deceased were guides with Blackbird Mountain Guides. Zeb Blais, the company’s founder, issued a statement calling it an “enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced”, adding that the guides had all been trained or certified in backcountry skiing by the American Mountain Guides Association and were instructors with the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education.
Blackbird Mountain Guides referred additional questions from the Guardian to the Nevada county sheriff’s office.
Information about what went wrong on the mountainside is still forthcoming – including why the group decided to leave the huts where they had sheltered the night before. An analysis by the San Francisco Chronicle shows that the group took a route on Tuesday that passed over terrain rated at a higher risk for an avalanche than a longer, slower alternative exit, although the reasons for doing so are not yet clear.
The Nevada county sheriff’s office and Cal/Osha have opened standard investigations into the incident, to determine whether criminal charges are warranted.
A mountain range with a history of avalanches
Avalanches are not uncommon in the Sierras, although Tuesday’s is the most devastating in modern California history.
“Naturally occurring avalanches are relatively common in mountainous areas that receive snow, like the greater Tahoe area covered by our daily avalanche forecast,” said David Reichel, executive director of the Sierra Avalanche Center. “Every time a major storm hits the area, it is reasonable to assume many avalanches occur.”
The Sierra Avalanche Center, which provides forecasts for the region, has observed at least 50 avalanches in the area near Lake Tahoe since September 2025, and people have died in avalanches in the Lake Tahoe area in six out of the past 10 years. Most recently, a snowmobiler was killed earlier this year when an avalanche occurred in the same area near Castle Peak.
Perhaps the most well-known avalanche to occur in the region was the Alpine Meadows avalanche of 1982, which killed seven and was memorialized in the film Buried: The 1982 Alpine Meadows Avalanche and the book A Wall of White by Jennifer Woodlief.
What specifically caused the heavy sheet of snow to break loose and cascade down the slopes remains unclear. But a series of conditions set the stage, and forecasters had warned that the risks for an event like this were perilously high.
Before this week’s storms blanketed the Sierra in dense and heavy snow, the mountains were worryingly bare. In an exceedingly warm winter, where precipitation fell more often as rain and a more rapid melt-off was likely, brown patches could be seen poking through the thin icy layer at elevations typically shrouded in white during the early months of the year.
This created a dangerous foundation for new snowfall, which couldn’t easily integrate onto frozen landscapes. It also meant hidden hazards – rocks, gravel and downed trees – could slip into layers near the surface, increasing the dangers.
This one-two-punch – a devastating snow drought that produced a thin layer of ice followed by heavy and rapid snow accumulation – “fits the pattern of major avalanche events we have seen in this part of California in the past”, said climate scientist Daniel Swain. Swain has long warned of the compounding threats posed by these extremes, and how the climate crisis will fuel more damaging swings between extremes.
The storm at the center of this tragedy was not extraordinary by Sierra standards, where furious winter elements can turn turbulent quickly, but it was intense. More than 66in had fallen over three days, the UC Berkeley Central Sierra Snow Lab reported on Wednesday morning, the day after the avalanche. Whiteout conditions and gale-force winds added threats faced by the skiers and complicated rescue efforts.
Before Tuesday’s avalanche, the Colorado avalanche information center had tallied six US avalanche deaths so far this season. It says avalanches have claimed an average of 27 lives a year over the past decade in the US.
The communities affected by this particular disaster are only just beginning to come into focus, as family members mourn their loss.
“Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honoring the lives of these extraordinary women,” the families shared in their statement. “They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”

Wang Fuk Court buyback plan disappoints some residents despite ‘generous’ offer
Government announces offer to purchase flats destroyed in blaze at HK$8,000 or HK$10,500 per square foot, but some residents prefer redevelopment
Some homeowners displaced by the deadly Tai Po blaze were disappointed by Hong Kong authorities’ decision to buy back their flats instead of resettling them at the original site, even as the acquisition offer was described by a surveyor as “generous”.
Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun unveiled the long-term resettlement plan on Saturday, offering options to buy back the flats at HK$8,000 or HK$10,500 (US$1,023 or US$1,343) per square foot.
Homeowners could also opt for “flat-for-flat” exchanges, which will allow them to purchase a new subsidised flat from 10 designated projects under the Housing Authority or the Housing Society.
But Wong ruled out redevelopment of Wang Fuk Court, which he said could take nine to 10 years.
The inferno that engulfed seven of the estate’s eight towers last November killed 168 people and displaced about 5,000 residents
A former resident of the estate surnamed Ho who supports rebuilding told the South China Morning Post that many neighbours were angered by the proposal and felt authorities had ignored their views.

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in eastern Pacific, killing 3
The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat floating in the water before bursting into flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to at least 148 people in at least 43 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.”
Critics have questioned the overall legality of the strikes as well as their effectiveness, in part because the fentanyl behind many fatal overdoses is typically trafficked to the U.S. over land from Mexico, where it is produced with chemicals imported from China and India.
The boat strikes also drew intense criticism following the revelation that the military killed survivors of the very first boat attack with a follow-up strike. The Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers said it was legal and necessary, while Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the killings were murder, if not a war crime.

She was an orphan in Iran adopted by US veteran. The Trump admin wants to deport her

She was an orphan in Iran adopted by US veteran. The Trump admin wants to deport her
She is one of thousands of individuals adopted from abroad who were never granted citizenship due to a complex intersection of adoption and immigration law
- Bookmark
A woman adopted as a toddler from an Iranian orphanage by an American war veteran, and raised as a Christian in the United States, is facing deportation to Iran – a country where Christians face severe persecution and which is currently on the brink of potential conflict with the US.
She is one of thousands of individuals adopted from abroad who were never granted citizenship due to a complex intersection of adoption and immigration law. The woman, whose name The Associated Press has withheld due to her precarious legal situation, recently received a letter from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ordering her to appear for removal proceedings before an immigration judge in California. She has no criminal record. The letter states she is eligible for deportation because she overstayed her visa in March 1974, when she was just four years old.
"I never imagined it would get to where it is today," the woman said, expressing her belief that, as a Christian and the daughter of an American Air Force officer, deportation to Iran could be a death sentence. "I always told myself that there is no way that this country could possibly send someone to their death in a country they left as an orphan. How could the United States do that?"
The already terrifying prospect of deportation has been amplified by recent geopolitical tensions, she noted, as the Trump administration began amassing a significant force of American warships and aircraft in the Middle East, preparing for potential military action against Iran if nuclear programme talks fail.
The Associated Press profiled the woman in 2024 as part of a wider investigation into how many international adoptees were left without citizenship because their American adoptive parents failed to naturalize them. The woman has spent years attempting to rectify her legal status, with the DHS aware of her situation since at least 2008. She estimates her file runs to thousands of pages and remains unsure what prompted the sudden threat of removal.
The Trump administration has pursued a mass deportation campaign, asserting it is removing the "worst of the worst" criminals. However, many individuals with no criminal records have been caught in the dragnet. The woman’s only interaction with law enforcement she can recall was being stopped 20 years ago for using her phone while driving. She works in corporate healthcare, pays taxes, and owns a home in California.
"When the media refuses to give names, it makes it impossible to provide details on specific cases or even verify any of this even happened or that the people even exist. If you can’t do your job, we can’t do ours," the Department of Homeland Security stated. The AP did not provide the woman's name but sent a detailed description of the letter she received, the stated reasons for her deportation eligibility, and her original court date of March 4. A judge has since delayed the hearing to later next month and agreed with her attorney, Emily Howe, that the woman does not have to appear in person – a relief given concerns that immigration officers might be waiting to detain her.
Adopted in Iran when she was 2
The woman’s father, a World War II prisoner of war, retired from the Air Force and worked as a government contractor in Iran. He and his wife found her in an orphanage in 1972 and adopted her when she was two years old. They returned to the US in 1973, with a local newspaper running a full-page story about the family and their new daughter. Her adoption was finalized in 1975.
However, at that time, parents were required to naturalize adopted children through the federal immigration agency separately. Both of the woman’s parents have since passed away.
She only discovered she had not been naturalized when she applied for a passport at the age of 38. She still does not understand how the oversight occurred. Searching her father’s papers, she found a 1975 letter from a lawyer stating he was working with immigration officials, concluding, "it appears this matter is concluded," and billing her father for his services.
She has not kept her situation secret, seeking help for years from the State Department, immigration officials, and senators. She contacted her congresswoman, Rep. Young Kim, a Republican from California, but to no avail. Kim’s office recently responded to her plea about her pending removal by stating they were "not able to advise or interfere."
"It just baffles me that it’s OK to send me to a foreign country that I could potentially die or I could get imprisoned because of a clerical error," she said.
More recent adoptees do not face this legal limbo. Congress passed a bill in 2000 to rectify the issue, conferring automatic citizenship on everyone legally adopted from abroad. However, the law was not made retroactive and applied only to those younger than 18 when it took effect; anyone born before the arbitrary date of February 27, 1983, was excluded.
Coalition tries to protect older adoptees
A bipartisan coalition, ranging from the Southern Baptist Convention to liberal immigration groups, has since lobbied Congress to pass another bill to assist older adoptees excluded by the law, but Congress has not acted. Some lobbyists now argue that the administration’s threat to deport an adoptee is precisely the scenario they worked hard to prevent.
"I’m horrified. It’s rare for me to feel shocked by a story these days. But this is an absolutely unbelievable situation," said Hannah Daniel, who, as director of public policy for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the lobbying arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, spent years urging legislators to address the issue.
Intercountry adoption has been a rare topic championed by lawmakers across the political spectrum. Many Christian churches advocate intercountry adoption as a biblical calling, mirroring God’s welcome of believers into a family of faith.
Daniel, who recently joined World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organisation, said threatening to send a Christian adoptee to Iran represents a collision of two issues she and many other Christians deeply care about: international adoption and the persecution of Christians globally.
"That is what is most troubling to me about this: We are a nation that prides itself on fighting for religious freedom both here and abroad," Daniel said. "And it feels so antithetical to that to then say we’re going to send this person who, for me, is a sister in Christ to face a death sentence." She called it "un-American and unconscionable."
Converts to Christianity in Iran face intense discrimination
Ryan Brown, chief executive officer of Open Doors, a non-profit supporting persecuted Christians worldwide, explained that while some Christians in Iran are Christian by birth and face widespread discrimination, the situation is far worse for those considered converts from Islam. He expects a deported adoptee would be viewed in the latter category – as a convert.
"It is assumed that you are an enemy of the state. It is assumed that if you are a Christian, that you are aligned to the West and you desire to see that the regime toppled," he said. "There is no benefit of the doubt extended."
Converted Christians are routinely arrested, with some sentenced to death. "Their prisons are world renowned for their deplorable conditions," Brown said, citing a lack of sanitation, scarce food, water, and healthcare. Iranian prisons are "notoriously more evil for women," he added, with women routinely reporting sexual assault by captors and some forced into marriages.
Brown, an adoptive father himself, struggled to contemplate what a Christian woman, accustomed to the freedoms of the United States, might experience if forced to return to Iran. She does not know the language or customs, having lived a fully American life. "I cannot even fathom that," Brown said. "My prayers are with her."
The woman believes Iran would likely view her with even greater suspicion given her father’s military service and work as a US government contractor. She grew up listening to his war stories, reading the journal he kept as a prisoner of war, and was proud of his sacrifice and service to a country she believed had saved her.
When she feels sad or scared now, she looks at her favourite photo of him in his military uniform, medals on his left shoulder, a slight, confident smile on his face. "I’m proud of my father’s legacy. I’m part of his legacy. And what’s happening to me is wrong," she said. "And I know that he was here, it would break his heart to know that I’m on this path."

Syrian Kurdish leader warns of ‘renewed war’ after ceasefire agreement
A Syrian Kurdish leader has said that there is a “real risk” of a new war breaking out in Syria, saying that a January 29 agreement with the Syrian government had not been implemented.
Ilham Ahmed, the Co-Chair of the Foreign Affairs Department of the Autonomous Administration of Northeastern Syria (AANES), told Rohani TV that “the language of hate” used by parts of Syrian society had hindered the implementation of the agreement.
She said that work is ongoing to restructure brigades of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), but added that women’s participation in parts of the Syrian government remained limited, and that they had to participate in all fields.
Under the agreement the SDF, which are affiliated with AANES, will be reconstituted into four brigades affiliated with the Syrian military, while Kurdish security forces will be integrated with those of the government, and Interior Ministry security forces will enter the SDF-held cities of Hasakah and Qamishli.
AANES governing institutions will also be integrated into those of the Syrian state.
However, Ahmed claimed that Turkey, a key backer of the Syrian government, was playing a negative role and did not want a solution.
“The Turkish state has repeatedly pushed the region toward war,” she said, while also accusing authorities in Damascus of “not wanting Syrian Kurds to have an active presence in state institutions.”
An earlier agreement between the Syrian government and the SDF, signed in March 2025, broke down last January, with the government accusing the group of repeatedly stalling its integration into state institutions.
Fighting broke out and government forces captured most of the areas once held by the Kurdish-held SDF, including the Arab-majority cities of Tabqa and Raqqa and Kurdish areas of Aleppo.
Ahmed said that she had recently met Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani at the Munich Security Conference in Germany and that they had agreed on further meetings. She also said she had met recently with US officials.
The US backed the SDF when it fought against the Islamic State extremist group during the Syrian conflict, but recently switched support to the Syrian government led by President Ahmed Al-Sharaa.
However, two members of the US Senate – Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal – have introduced a “Save the Kurds” bill following the government advances, which Ahmed expressed support for.
Amid the conflict with the SDF, Sharaa signed a decree granting citizenship to Kurds who had been deprived of it and recognising Kurdish as a national language, in moves unprecedented in Syria.
However, Syrian Kurds have said this doesn’t go far enough and that guarantees of Kurdish rights need to be included in the country’s constitution.

Navigating modern perceptions: What Zionism truly means to me - opinion

In many of my jobs I’ve held over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to interview executives, mostly not Jewish, overseas, on the phone or via Zoom. I would do my best not to indicate where I was based, other than the restrictions on my working hours that might not seem exactly nine-to-five, Eastern time.
My being in Israel was not something I was embarrassed about; it just wasn’t a topic I needed to insert into an interview about, say, the classified advertising business.
From time to time, though, an interviewee would ask me where I lived, and I wouldn’t hold back. “Israel,” I’d reply confidently. The inevitable next question, given that he or she could tell I didn’t have a Hebrew accent, was what brought me to the Holy Land. My usual answer: “Zionism.”
Now, though, I’m not sure I’d be comfortable answering like that. “Zionism” has become a pejorative in many international circles.
That doesn’t mean I’m no longer a Zionist. On the contrary, I believe deeply in the right of the Jewish state to exist. But it got me thinking about what’s happened to the concept of Zionism over the past few years and how that affects what I can and should say.
A recent survey by the Jewish Federations of North America found that only one-third of American Jews said they identify as Zionist, even as nearly nine in 10 said they support Israel’s right to exist.
That confused dichotomy clearly stems from the misperception that being a Zionist means you must support whatever actions Israel’s current government takes.
That’s not the case at all. I, like most of my friends and peers, strongly oppose the policies of the Benjamin Netanyahu-led gang of thugs, crooks, incompetents, and racists. This government is beholden to its most extreme elements, and that’s contributing to a poisoned discourse.
Yet, at the same time, I support this country with all my heart. It has been my home for 31 years and has indelibly shaped my identity, even if my Hebrew-language skills never pulled their weight. There’s that old saw that in the Diaspora you have to spend most of your time “doing” Jewish – our Jewish life in California revolved around synagogue activities – while in Israel, it’s all about “being” Jewish.
In Israel, my wife, Jody, and I have been able to raise our family in an enveloping Jewish structure – calendar, school, language, culture. I value the way Israelis are always ready to help one another, even when they’re yelling; the way we came together after Oct. 7 to fill in the gaps of an absent polity.
'You don’t have to search for your Jewishness – it’s all around you'
You don’t have to search for your Jewishness – it’s all around you. Nor are we obsessed with the issues that animate Diaspora Jewish life. “You’d really have to scour the Israeli Hebrew press to even find mention of the word ‘genocide,’” wrote Shalem College’s Daniel Gordis on his Substack, referring to one of the hot topics of American vs Israeli disquisition.
This confusion about Zionism dovetails with the ad paid for by American businessman Robert Kraft that aired during the 2026 Super Bowl. In it, David, a Jewish teenager, is taunted by his peers, who place a “Dirty Jew” yellow sticker on his backpack. He is ultimately “saved” by Bilal, a Black student, who places a blue Post-it Note (a reference to Kraft’s Blue Square Alliance) over the yellow sticker.
This depiction of the Jew as victim is wholly out of sync with the Zionism we Israelis feel. We may get rockets lobbed at us (all too frequently), but we see ourselves as strong, tough, possessed of agency.
Liel Leibowitz, writing in Tablet magazine, proposed an alternative ad. In it, we’re shown Hezbollah agents getting blown up by pagers, Israel Air Force planes over Tehran, news reports on the deaths of Hassan Nasrallah and Yahya Sinwar. A little on the nose? Absolutely. I wonder how it would have played among Super Bowl viewers.
“We have the honor of being hated by an axis of the perfidious, the despotic, the hypocritical, the cynical, the deranged and the incredibly stupid,” said Bret Stephens, New York Times columnist and onetime editor of The Jerusalem Post, at this year’s State of World Jewry talk in New York.
Zionism “was never supposed to make Jews comfortable,” noted Adam Scott Bellows, the CEO of the Israel Innovation Fund, in the Post. “It was supposed to make Jews durable.”
Joel Swanson, a scholar of modern Jewish history at Sarah Lawrence College, emphasized, in another Post article, that Zionism is not a static single-use symbol for believing Israel should exist. There are many types of Zionism: political Zionism, cultural Zionism, Religious Zionism, Revisionist Zionism.
“To say ‘Zionism’ without adjectives is already to erase its internal diversity,” Swanson wrote.
He pointed to Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, a committed Zionist who immigrated to Palestine. But, Swanson added, “He also advocated for a binational state, shared by Jews and Arabs.... [Today] if you espouse Martin Buber’s views... without an emphasis on maintaining a Jewish voting majority, you are labeled an anti-Zionist.”
Nevertheless, I find Swanson’s thesis the most compelling: Zionism is multifaceted. I’m living proof. When I first moved to Israel, I was firmly in the Religious-Zionist camp. Over time, I became more of a secular, cultural Zionist. But I always had a place to fit in.
So, when I’m asked these days why I live here, I will continue to answer, “Because I’m a Zionist.” I may have to explain a bit more; it’s not a simple one-line response anymore. But I’m not ready to give it up.
The writer’s book Totaled: The Billion-Dollar Crash of the Startup that Took on Big Auto, Big Oil and the World was published earlier this year as an audiobook. It is available on Amazon and other online booksellers in print, e-book, and Audible formats. brianblum.com

'There is a future': How Finland’s 850 Jews survive and thrive in the Diaspora

“You can be born Jewish in Finland, get circumcised, married, divorced: it’s a one-stop shop,” Chaya Votkin, president of the Jewish Community of Helsinki, told The Jerusalem Post at the Yael Foundation conference earlier this month.
Finland’s Jewish community is small. There are at least 850 registered members, but, of course, there may be many who choose not to register. Then there are people living in Helsinki who are part of the wider community, such as spouses who are not Jewish.
Demographically speaking, the community is quite unique. It began in the first half of the 19th century, when Jewish soldiers (known as cantonists) serving in the Imperial Russian Army in Finland were granted permission by Russian military authorities to stay in Finland after completing their military service.
“They stayed there, and then they brought some spouses from Baltic countries because they were men who finished the army service. And then they started their families. I think that it was quite homogeneous for generations,” said Votkin.
Today, it is more diverse. “I think that today our beauty is the fact that we are a very diverse community, and we are still all together.”
Votkin was elected last May, and is the first female president of the community. She explained that the benefit of a small community such as hers is that everyone is together regardless of background, religious level, or age.
“If we were in New York, in Israel, everyone would go to at least 20 different synagogues. And in Finland, we all go to the same two [the Orthodox synagogue in Helsinki and the Orthodox synagogue in Turku].
“We just need to find a common ground. I don’t want to always focus on the negative idea, about having a common enemy – this is not enough. We have so much more than a common enemy. We have a long tradition, and we have a long future and a beautiful present day.
Finnish community celebrates Jewish diversity
“So I think that we have to really celebrate, first of all, diversity. Be proud of the fact that we are so different – different ages, different backgrounds – Ashkenazi, haredi, Mizrahi, you name it. And different languages. And I think there is beauty in it. If we can work together, we can be a model to the whole world.”
Votkin’s goal is to have a Jewish hub that is “warm and welcoming, and where we celebrate Jewish life and culture.” She has already opened a pop-up café called Cafe Kesher, and is set to open a bar soon. She also dreams of a restaurant, because then she will have a “base, a warm place where people want to come, not just because it’s religious.
“I see that it’s a community project, kind of like a homemaking.”
There is a well-established Jewish school with about 80 students, and a kindergarten with around 40 children. The school follows the Finnish curriculum but also teaches Hebrew language and Jewish religion (with advanced options: advanced religion for those who come from more religious families and know the basics already, and advanced Hebrew for those who speak Hebrew at home) and Jewish history.
The community also has kosher food, and frozen kosher meat is imported. There is also a cemetery and a hevra kadisha, which is the oldest association in Finland.
“So you can be born Jewish in Finland. You get a circumcision. You get married. You can also get a divorce.
“So, basically, the idea is that we can enable a full Jewish life in Finland, with kosher food and holidays and Shabbat and prayer and education. We are fewer people, but it makes it more powerful sometimes because there’s more effort to keep it together.”
THE STRONGER the community is, the better it will be able to face the modern-day threats of Jew-hatred and hostility, she said.
“Everyone is affected after October 7. Everyone has been kind of in a state of shock and mourning. And it’s very important for people to have a place where they can freely be who they are. Come with a kippah, with a hai, or with a Magen [Star of] David. Speak Hebrew. Talk about Israel. And feel completely like you don’t have to pretend. A physically safe space, but also a mentally safe one.
“After October 7, we have more posts online that are not friendly. Demonstrations and all kinds of boycott campaigns for Israeli products and this and that.”
There have been some incidents in Finland involving the Jewish community. A stone was thrown through the window of one of the members, someone graffitied the Turku Synagogue wall, and there is one demonstrator who turns up to shout about genocide and child murder.
However, Votkin said that the Finnish government has been “very” supportive of, and involved with, the Jewish community.
“They’ve been very supportive. They are really helping us with security. And also, we have a good connection to the police forces and government officials. I was speaking to 160 government officials about the Holocaust on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. And I think it was very positive that people want to know more and they want to support the Jewish minority.”
Votkin did stress that after the graffiti incident, the president of Finland took it very seriously, and locals brought flowers to the synagogue to show solidarity.
“In Finland, we have to talk a language that they understand. I think it’s important to talk about the fact that we are a minority culture. We need to preserve the culture.”
She stressed the importance of teaching Finnish children about Judaism, as most may never meet a Jewish person.
“We would need more education about Judaism to regular Finns. They need to know we exist between all the sad incidents and sad memorabilia.”
Votkin spoke extensively about this: the importance of the Jewish story not being just about suffering, but also achievement, success, and creation.
She explained that Finnish media are mostly focused on Jewish deaths, like of Holocaust survivors. “Then they’re like, ‘now we remember the Jews because six million died.’ Or after Sydney, they call us. How do you feel now that Jews died? But they forget you exist when you’re happy. I want them to write about Jewish life, what we do when we are living. We’re full of Jewish life, with all the beautiful holidays and Shabbat and culture and food and a feeling of community.”
The media’s view is not so friendly toward Israel, she added. “They emphasize the human side of Palestinian suffering, and then the Jews are just the attackers and the naughty ones.”
She believes that the biggest form of antisemitism in Finland at the moment is anti-Zionism, but that, comparatively, Finland is not the worst place when it comes to Jew hatred.
“If something really big happens, then we’ll leave.” People from Finland do make aliyah, especially young people, but Votkin said “it’s not something that we do in masses right now.
“But if the situation changes, I think it’s still very important for every Jew to know that there’s a homeland. If something happens, then we’ll go together. So I think that if there will be a global aliyah, then maybe Finland will join. But I think otherwise if everything is calm and peaceful. I think there is a Jewish future.
“As long as there is a future for Jews in Europe, there is a future for Jews in Finland,” she said.

In the final biathlon event of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, France's Océane Michelon overcame a missed target in the final shooting stage in the 12.5-kilometer mass start race to take gold. In heavy snow and low visibility, Michelon left the range in fourth place but moved ahead on the ski trails to complete the five laps in 37 minutes, 18.1 seconds.
Michelon's teammate, Julia Simon, also moved up in the final 2.5 kilometers, crossing the finish line 6.6 seconds back and securing the silver medal. Czech biathlete Tereza Vobornikova had been leading after the final shooting but had to settle for bronze after being overtaken by the French powerhouse team, finishing 7.4 seconds behind Michelon. Anna Magnusson of Sweden, the only biathlete to hit all 20 of her targets, finished fourth, 26.6 seconds back.
Italy's Dorothea Wierer, favored by the fans who roared with excitement each time she hit a target, missed two, and at one point was sitting in 16th place, but she cleaned her last standing shooting and crossed the line 30 seconds back in fifth place. Wierer, who turns 36 in April, had announced her plans to retire after these Olympics, along with Germany's Franziska Preuss, who finished 28th with seven misses. Wierer and Preuss held small flags and skied a short loop together in front of the packed stands, and then celebrated their final race with champagne.
Olympic mass start defending champion Justine Braisaz-Bouchet of France finished a disappointing 27th place, 3:12.2 back, after missing six targets.
Only the top 30 biathletes compete in the mass start race — based on World Cup rankings and Olympic performance. They ski five, 2.5-kilometer loops, shooting twice in the prone position and twice standing.

Fire breaks out in Russia's Saransk, reportedly at plant making power electronics for Russian troops
A fire has broken out in an industrial zone in the city of Saransk, the capital of Russia's Republic of Mordovia, with social media reports suggesting it was at Electrovypryamitel, one of the country's largest producers of power electronics for the Russian armed forces.
Source: The Moscow Times, an independent Amsterdam-based news outlet
Details: A fire erupted in Saransk at about 10:00 on 21 February in an industrial zone. The regional emergency ministry said the blaze occurred near a defence industry facility, the Saransk Instrument Making Plant, on Vasenko Street, without giving a cause.
The fire spread through one workshop at the plant, covering an area of 150 sq m. Two hours later, the emergency ministry reported the blaze had been localised and said no one was injured.
At about 07:30, the authorities said a drone alert had been declared in the region. It was lifted at 10:30.
However, local residents told the Russian Astra Telegram channel that the fire was in the premises of Electrovypryamitel PJSC, one of Russia's largest manufacturers of power electronics for the needs of the Russian armed forces. Local residents suggested the plant may have been hit by drones.
Astra also analysed footage from eyewitnesses showing a large column of black smoke and concluded that Electrovypryamitel was the site of the blaze.
The company produces rectifiers, inverters, power supplies, converters and other specialised electrical equipment. It is under sanctions by the United States, Canada, the EU, the UK, Switzerland, New Zealand and Japan over its involvement in Russia's state defence orders.
Background: The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said its Rocket Forces and Artillery units struck the Votkinsk plant in Russia's Udmurt Republic on the night of 20-21 February, using FP-5 Flamingo cruise missiles.

Germany’s ruling party seeks social media ban for children aged below 14
Spain, Greece, France, Britain and other countries are looking at similar social media bans or curbs
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
Germany’s ruling conservatives on Saturday passed a motion to ban social media use for under 14s and introduce more stringent digital verification checks for teenagers, building momentum for such limits in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
At a party conference in the city of Stuttgart, Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union also called for fines for online platforms that failed to enforce such limits and European Union-wide harmonisation of age standards.
A growing number of countries, including Spain, Greece, France and Britain, are looking at similar social media bans or restrictions on accessing platforms like TikTok or Instagram.

It follows the example of Australia, which last year became the first country to force platforms to cut off access for children.
European nations are more broadly ratcheting up pressure on social media companies, risking a backlash from the United States. President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs and sanctions if EU countries impose new tech taxes or online regulations that hit US firms.

“We call on the federal government to introduce a legal age limit of 14 for the use of social networks and to address the special need for protection in the digital sphere up to the age of 16,” said the motion that passed on Saturday.

Far-right groups march in Lyon after activist's killing
France

23:49:01 KST

Around 3,200 people marched in Lyon, France, on Saturday, February 21, in memory of a far-right activist whose killing has been blamed on the hard left, according to estimates by the prefecture for the region. The rally, widely publicized online by ultra-nationalist and far-right groups, was held under heavy security, with authorities fearing clashes with left-wing protesters.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of the tribute to Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week. "This is a moment of remembrance and respect for this young compatriot who was killed, for his family and loved ones. That must come first. And then it is a moment of firmness and responsibility," Macron said.
Seven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon prosecutor's office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a hard-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Frequent clashes in Lyon
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers next week to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled. "In the Republic, no violence is legitimate," he said. "There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising."
The main tribute to Deranque took place in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Their fighting often takes the form of organized street battles in the city, sometimes involving groups of several dozen people. Lyon's far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque's parents also called for calm and did not take part in the tribute, which was not banned by French authorities. Most participants at the march were not wearing political symbols, as requested by the organizers, Le Monde reporters saw.
LFI under pressure
Deranque's death triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming the hard-left La France Insoumise (LFI) party and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a LFI lawmaker who set up the anti-fascist group Jeune Garde.
There was a minute's silence before the start of the march. Some demonstrators held white tulips and displayed stickers bearing the slogan: "Quentin, killed by Mélenchon's militia." Many men dressed in black, some with their faces partially covered, joined the march.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonize LFI. Far-right Rassemblement National leader Jordan Bardella called for a common front against Mélenchon's party. Criticism also came from prominent figures on the left, including former French President François Hollande. He said the mainstream left, including his Socialists, must not team up again with Mélenchon's party for the upcoming elections, as they did in the past.
The rally went ahead despite Lyon's left-wing Green mayor, Gregory Doucet, asking the state to ban it, telling reporters he did not "want Lyon to be the capital of the far right, at any point." LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard backed the Lyon mayor's call for a ban, warning on X that the march would be a "fascist demonstration."
But Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez declined to ban the rally, arguing that he had to "strike a balance between maintaining public order and freedom of expression" and pledging an "extremely large police deployment."

Inside Nikopol: The only place to hide from Putin’s killer drones is our underground school
In a harrowing dispatch from the frontline city of Nikopol – so close to Russian forces that few journalists have ventured there – World Affairs Editor Sam Kiley talks to children, parents and teachers who are hunted down daily by Putin’s deadly quadcopters, yet have somehow managed to survive
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station captured by Russia is a staging post for “hunting” trips against civilians.
Acting as a base for artillery within mortar range and a nearby drone pilot school, it looms so close to the city of Nikopol that one could almost pat the plant’s unstable nuclear domes.
Nikopol, still held by Ukraine, has seen its population halve to 50,000 since the war began. About 6,500 of those still living here are children.
Lying right on the front line, the city has been attacked every day for the last four years. Roads in are a gamble and gauntlet, a race along icy roads, in hope of avoiding an attack or a freezing crash.
First Person View drones (FPVs) are flown by Russian pilots who can see the streets of Nikopol with the naked eye from the nuclear plant across the river.
But they go one step further to see the look on their victim’s faces when they dive their quadcopter killers onto whomever they choose to die.
Despite this, half of this city’s inhabitants have decided to stay. Hunted as prey, and shelled at random, countless people have been killed by Russia here since 2022, when Vladimir Putin’s forces captured the power station just over the river.
Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are opting to live in this place they call home, flitting about the streets like the prey they are and sending their children to underground schools.
On arrival at School Number 6, the vast main atrium is silent but for a few footsteps. Outside, a not-too-distant crack and thump of a drone that has got through the bad weather and hit the city rattles at the hall windows.
A teacher shrugs and leads the way into the cellar to start the day. Its walls are decorated with posters about how to spot unexploded bombs. One shows a red drone with its four engines and gives instructions on how to hide from these new weapons.
“Good morning!” chime a classroom full of seven- and eight-year-old Ukrainian children in grade two, the UK’s year 3.
Spinning backwards in their chairs to see the visitor in a windowless classroom, they smile and wriggle. Laptops sit on the desks in front of them as their teacher, Iryna Sichkarenko, asks them to recite in English “my name is…”.
This is a warm and safe place where they can learn and hang out with friends. Above ground, in the sunlight, that has been impossible for more than half the lives of this class of 20 kids.
Putin has increased the pounding of civilian targets over the last year. His troops have singled out the port city of Odesa in the far south, Kramatorsk in the north and the energy systems across the country, for especially violent attention.
The Russian president intends to drive Ukraine out of the eastern territories he has already illegally annexed and to cripple the country in the long term.
So-called “peace talks” run by the US, which has adopted a largely pro-Russian position and demanded concessions from Ukraine in return for mineral rights and a ceasefire, have delivered nothing.
In places like Nikopol, though, the steady state of attacks has changed only with the advent of the deadly accurate drones.
On the battlefield, statistics have been upended – drones kill about 80 per cent of the people they hit and wound the rest. Guns and old-fashioned artillery have statistics the other way around.
For these children, underground school is a lifeline to normality in a very abnormal world.
“Here we can discuss our dreams, weekends, plans, interests. It’s live communication and we value every minute we can meet, draw something, do some crafts or organise some kind of party,” the teacher says.
They get two morning sessions like this a week. The rest of these children’s lives is spent at home and studying remotely as if the Covid pandemic never ended.
Bohdan is seven. He reads out loud with confidence and dramatic inflection. It’s a story about Grandpa Frost because in the lives of these youngsters, there is little space for whimsy.
“A small old man with a grey beard was sitting on a bench and drawing something in the sand with an umbrella. ‘Move over’, Pavlyk said to him and sat on the edge,” Bohdan’s fingers trace the words as he talks.
Lilia, also seven, also reads from the book: “‘There is such a magic word…’ Pavlyk opened his mouth wide. ‘I will tell you this word, but remember: you must say it in a quiet voice, looking straight…’.”
Pavlyk is an angry character. Anger is an instantly recognisable theme for these kids and something that takes hold of some of them and won’t let go.
Bohdan’s mother, Inna Liaskovska, says her son loves school but suffers from anxiety.
“Sometimes he gets nervous. He can react very childishly and he can’t hold his emotions,” she explains.
“He needs to release them. He releases them through hysterics, shouting for no reason. You tell him ‘no, don’t do it’, and for him it’s like an emotional explosion.
“He doesn’t want to listen to anyone, doesn’t want to do anything – he just closes off, he has such hysterics.”
That is not surprising because, she says, she feels like they are being hunted every time they leave their flat.
“Last summer as soon as we went out, and it’s a miracle that we were still near the house, we had to run back to hide in the entrance, because we saw a drone flying past the house…
“So, I believe that yes, this is a targeted safari on people. There was another case: we were coming from school and, again, an FPV drone was flying. We hid behind the trees so that it would fly past, and we could get home safely.
“When we came home, my boy asks, ‘Mom, is everything okay?’ I say, ‘Everything is okay.’ Like, ‘don’t you worry’. But none of us is safe.”
Inna says she and Bohdan did leave Nikopol when the Russians first captured the power station opposite in 2022. They moved to safety in Poland for three months, but came back.
“Home is home. It was difficult there. Not as much physically as it was spiritually difficult. With a child, alone, without my husband. So we returned home to Ukraine.”
The underground school, built and maintained in large part with funds from Street Child International, offers counselling, social support, supplementary education and meals to children.
Anatasia Ukhan, Street Child’s local manager, is a teacher and has a 13-year-old too. She says: “These children don’t know how to communicate with each other; they are closed.
“Especially teenagers… With them, it’s the hardest. Small kids, they are still sincere and open, and they hope for the best.
“But the teenagers, grades 6 to 9, are much more difficult. They are closed. They don’t talk to anyone. So, unfortunately, desocialisation is happening. It will be a huge problem in the future,” she warns.
Another underground classroom holds about eight young teenagers. They sit, as people their age often do, awkward, muted. Fifty-three of the 58 schools in the city have been hit by Russian bombs and a couple more explosions can be heard hitting somewhere downtown as we visit.
Sophia Prokopenko, 15, says they are all experts at how to react depending on whether it is a drone or artillery. They endure incidents every day, she says.
“You go out into the street, and you can see or hear a drone. You go to training – a drone. If not a drone, then artillery.
“To training, to the store, to the pharmacy, just going out to throw out the trash – they are everywhere,” she adds.
She insists that the school is their salvation.
“We just can’t gather in another place. If we go to a cafe – a drone, FPV, or artillery – and that’s it; there’s no cafe and no people. School is the only place where we can hide from this cruel world.”
So why does she not also leave with her family?
“Of course, it’s very scary, very difficult to constantly be in such a state,” she explains. “Many have left – abroad, to other cities, to relatives, to Western Ukraine – but still, the best place remains at home, no matter how hard it is here.”
It’s not clear that Putin quite understands that.

Police arrest 3 men suspected of shipping opium poppy by mail in Spain and to U.S.
Three men were arrested in Spain last month for allegedly shipping dried opium poppy capsules by mail across Spain and to the United States.
The Spanish Civil Guard said Saturday that the three men were arrested in January and have remained in custody since. They were charged with crimes against public health for drug trafficking.
According to police, the investigation began last September after four postal shipments containing nearly 15.4 pounds of plant-based substances were intercepted at the Alicante-Elche Miguel Hernandez Airport.
Analysis determined that the substance was "Papaver somniferum," also known as opium poppy, a plant directly linked to the production of opium and its derivatives, the statement said.
Investigators noted that the same surname was used on all the shipments, both for the senders and recipients. It was also verified that all the packages had been sent from different addresses, located in the municipality of Los Alcázares, in the Murcia region.
The operation led to the identification of three men from the same clan, all born in India, who were arrested and a stash of about 1,161 pounds of Papaver somniferum was seized.
After consulting police databases, investigators verified that the three men had been linked to recent thefts of opium poppy from legal plantations intended for pharmaceutical use and located in the province of Albacete.
"In Spain, there are legal crops of this plant intended for pharmaceutical use," said Guardia Civil spokesman Álvaro Gallardo. "But there are many people who extract opium completely illegally for consumption or trafficking, something dangerous if done uncontrollably, since it is a narcotic substance."
The three detainees were brought before the investigating court of the judicial district of Elche, which ordered their imprisonment.

2 Palestinians killed, 5 injured in Israeli strikes across Gaza despite ceasefire
Attacks occurred in areas outside Israeli military deployment under truce deal
GAZA CITY, Palestine
Two Palestinians were killed and five others injured Saturday in Israeli attacks on various areas of the Gaza Strip, despite a ceasefire agreement that has been in effect since Oct. 10, 2025.
An elderly Palestinian man was killed when an Israeli drone dropped a bomb on the town of Jabalia in northern Gaza, medical sources told Anadolu.
Shortly before that, a 46-year-old Palestinian man was killed in an Israeli strike targeting the Qizan al-Najjar area, south of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, the same sources said.
Medical sources also reported that a 23-year-old Palestinian woman was shot in the neck by fire from an Israeli drone in the Shejaiya neighborhood, east of Gaza City.
Earlier, three Palestinians were injured by Israeli gunfire east of Omar al-Mukhtar Street in Shejaiya, with one reported in serious condition, according to medical sources.
In northern Gaza, another Palestinian was wounded in the chest and hand by Israeli gunfire in Jabalia al-Balad, the sources added.
The attacks took place in areas outside Israeli military control and deployment as outlined in the ceasefire agreement.
A US-backed ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since Oct. 10, halting Israel’s two-year offensive that has killed more than 72,000 people, most of them women and children, and injured over 171,000 others since October 2023.
Despite the truce, Israeli forces have committed hundreds of alleged violations through shelling and gunfire, killing 612 Palestinians and injuring 1,640 others, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

- Secret Service members will receive tailored suits at taxpayer expense, following reports that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem disliked the attire of a protective detail.
- Graduates from protective detail training will be issued two navy blue suits, which will have their names embroidered inside the jacket.
- The public contract solicitation from the Department of Homeland Security specifies that the suits must be entirely made in the United States.
- The contract is set to cover a five-year ordering period, with the total cost yet to be determined.
- A DHS spokesperson stated that the initiative aims to address an inequity, as non-uniformed agents currently have to pay for their own work attire, unlike those in the Uniformed Division.

Ukraine’s General Staff confirms missile strike on Russian military plant in Udmurtia
According to Ukrinform, this was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook.
“On the night of February 21, units of the Missile Forces and Artillery of the Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out a strike with FP-5 Flamingo cruise missiles. A defense industry enterprise – the Votkinsk Plant in the city of Votkinsk (Udmurt Republic, Russian Federation) – was hit. A fire was recorded on the premises of the facility. The results are being clarified,” the statement said.
The Votkinsk Plant performs the following functions: production of RS-24 Yars, Yars-S, and Yars-M intercontinental ballistic missiles; RSM-30 (R-30) Bulava ballistic missiles for Project 955A Borei-A nuclear submarines; 9M723-1 ballistic missiles for the Iskander-M operational-tactical missile system; and 9-S-7760 missiles for the Kinzhal air-launched missile system.
According to preliminary information, Ukrainian Defense Forces units also struck the Neftegorsk Gas Processing Plant in Russia’s Samara region, which is involved in supporting the needs of the Russian army. A fire was recorded on the plant’s territory. The scale of the damage is being clarified.
In addition, in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region, enemy fuel and lubricants storage facilities in Donetsk were hit, as well as a workshop producing and servicing UAVs in the area of Nova Karakuba.
Additionally, in the town of Polohy, in the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine’s Defense Forces struck an enemy logistics and supplies warehouse.
Enemy losses and the final scale of damage are being clarified.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, during the night of February 21 a plant in the city of Votkinsk, Udmurtia, which manufactures Iskander and Oreshnik ballistic missiles, was attacked.

As Israel prepares for the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi next week, Indian media report that New Delhi is seeking to significantly expand defense cooperation between the two countries, including joint development of advanced missile defense systems.
According to the Hindustan Times, India plans to propose joint development of systems to defend against ballistic missiles, laser-based interception technologies and long-range defensive missiles.
Modi is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Wednesday, Feb. 25, for a two-day visit that will include a special Cabinet session held in his honor. The visit, however, could be marked by political tensions. Opposition parties have threatened to boycott the session after Justice Minister Yariv Levin declined to invite Supreme Court President Isaac Amit to attend, raising the prospect of a half-empty Knesset and potential diplomatic embarrassment.
In India, the visit is being described as a strategic opportunity. The two countries previously signed a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation, launching a process estimated to be worth about $10 billion in the coming years.
The Hindustan Times reported that officials in Jerusalem have already agreed to share some of the most advanced defense technologies with New Delhi, including a laser interceptor unveiled in Israel in September.
The foundation for expanded cooperation was laid during a November 2025 visit to Israel by Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, during which the memorandum of understanding was signed, the report said.
India’s push for deeper collaboration was further encouraged by the recent conflict with Iran. According to the Hindustan Times, about 98% of the ballistic missiles launched from Iran toward Israel were successfully intercepted by systems including Iron Dome and Arrow, along with other air defense platforms. India is interested in acquiring similar capabilities.
The report added that India is also seeking to purchase long-range missiles, surface-to-surface missiles and missiles that can be launched from the air.

Ukraine strikes missile plant deep inside Russia
February 21, 2026Ukrainian forces struck a major industrial site deep inside Russia's Udmurt region, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Saturday.
The attack was confirmed by local officials. "One of the republics facilities was attacked by drones" launched by Ukraine, regional head Alexander Brechalov said in a Telegram post.
The Ukrainian military said it used domestically produced Flamingo missiles to hit the plant, located about 1,400 kilometers (800 miles) from Ukraine.
Plant reportedly manufactured ballistic missiles
The Russian news Telegram channel Astra reported that the target was the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a state-owned factory that produces Iskander ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable ICBMs.
Videos posted by residents show black smoke rising over the area and blown-out windows across Votkinsk. Russia temporarily closed several airports in the region following the attack.
The Ukrainian military also said that it hit a gas processing plant in Russia's Samara region.
The strike came days after US-brokered talks between Moscow and Kyiv ended Wednesday with no breakthrough, as the war's fourth anniversary nears.
The meetings in Switzerland were the third round organized by Washington, following earlier sessions in Abu Dhabi that officials called constructive but that yielded no progress.

Russian attack on Kharkiv kills two, Ukraine hits missile plant
Kharkiv regional administration head, Oleh Syniehubov, reported that 175 ‘combat clashes’ were recorded over the past 24 hours.
A Russian attack on the Kharkiv region killed two police officers Saturday during an evacuation in the village of Seredniy Burlyk, as Moscow and Kyiv continue trading attacks.
The head of Kharkiv’s regional administration, Oleh Syniehubov, reported that the city and 10 populated areas had been subjected to Russian attacks over the past 24 hours.

In Seredniy Burlyk, five people were also wounded by shelling.
“Over the past 24 hours, 175 combat clashes were recorded. On the South-Slobozhansky direction, the enemy four times stormed the positions of our units in the areas of the populated settlements of Staritsa, Lyman, Vovchansky Khutory, and Krugle,” Syniehubov wrote.
Moreover, three people were injured, including a woman, after a Russian air strike targeted one of the private sectors of Sumy, the National Police of Sumy Oblast reported.
According to the police, the Russian attack destroyed two residential buildings and damaged at least 10 neighbouring houses and a gas pipe.
It added that three people who were injured included two children aged five and 17, as well as a 70-year-old woman who was hospitalised.
Attack on an industrial site
Ukrainian drones targeted an industrial site in Russia’s Udmurt Republic, injuring 11 people, three of whom were hospitalised, according to the local health minister, Sergei Bagin, who issued an update on Telegram.
The head of the Udmurt Republic, Alexander Brechalov, also wrote in a Telegram post that “one of the republic’s facilities was attacked by drones”, adding that injuries and damage were reported.
Brechalov did not elaborate on what the targeted facility was responsible for. However, an unofficial Russian Telegram channel, ASTRA, reported after analysing footage from residents that the strike targeted the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a major state defence enterprise.
The Votkinsk factory produces Iskander ballistic missiles, which are often used against Ukraine, as well as nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Ukraine’s military confirmed the attack on the Votkinsk factory and said in a post on Facebook that a “fire was recorded on the territory of the object. The results are getting real.”
The army added that its troops hit a Russian gas processing plant in the Samara region, which caused a fire.
Separately, Russia’s TASS state news agency reported that Ukrainian drones were attempting to attack production facilities in Almetyevsk in Russia’s Tatarstan region, citing the head of the city as saying that defence systems were operating.
Russia’s RIA news agency also reported, citing the defence ministry, that Moscow’s forces took control of the village of Karpivka in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.

New dating of Jordan Valley site rewrites timeline of human migration from Africa - study
Unknown

Ubeidiya, a prehistoric site in the Jordan Valley, has been dated by researchers to be at least 1.9 million years old, according to a new study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the University of Haifa, and the University of Tulsa.
According to a Thursday statement released by Hebrew University, researchers used three different methods to date the site, challenging the preexisting notion of the site being between 1.2 and 1.6 million years old.
The first method, known as cosmogenic isotope burial dating, measures rare isotopes created when cosmic rays strike rocks of the surface. Once the rocks are buried, the isotopes begin to decay “at a predictable rate,” allowing researchers to learn how long they have been underground.
The second method was done by examnining traces of the Earth’s ancient magnetic field preserved in the site’s lake sediments, which “lock in the direction of the planet’s magnetic field at that moment,” the statement explained. Researchers then compared them against known magnetic rotations in Earth’s history in order to create a timeline.
However, some of the initial readings suggested that the sediment was around three million years old, which didn't match with any other findings, leading researchers to believe that the sediments had been moved around and redeposited over thousands of years by natural geological processes.
The third method used by researchers was the uranium-lead dating of fossilized freshwater snail shells in order “to establish a minimum age for the layers in which the stone tools were discovered.”
All three methods presented the same answer.
How did early humans migrate?
The new dating also sheds light on how early humans made and carried their tools.
At Ubeidiya, archaeologists also discovered found two different types of stone tools: the simpler Oldowan tradition, and the more advanced, carefully crafted Acheulean style involving hand axes.
“The ‘Ubeidiya Formation has long interested researchers because it preserves early evidence of the Acheulean culture, characterized by large bifacial stone tools found in association with rich faunal assemblages, including species of African and Asian origin, some of which are now extinct,” the statement said.
Based on the findings, researchers approximate that both tool-making traditions had been used by different groups of early humans migrating from Africa at roughly the same time, rather than one tradition gradually replacing the other.
The research paper titled “Complex exposure-burial history and Pleistocene sediment recycling in the Dead Sea Rift with implications for the age of the Acheulean site of Ubeidiya” is now available in Quaternary Science Reviews

Elon Musk revealed that the new Tesla Cybertruck will only be available at its "cheap" $59,999 starting price for 10 days.
Musk posted on X/Twitter, saying "only for ten days," in response to an announcement about the new Cybertruck's specifications, without clarifying what he meant.
The new model has a lower towing capacity, dropping from 5000 kg to 3600 kg, according to the official Tesla website, while some features were removed from the truck in what Tesla described as its "most affordable Cybertruck yet."
This version will be available for $59,990; the Premium version will keep its $79,990 price tag; and the Cyberbeast will be available for $99,990.
For the time being, the Cybertruck's latest version can only be purchased in the United States, while there is no official way to buy any version of the electric pickup truck currently in Israel.
Tesla to start autonomous driving tests in Israel
The news comes as Tesla cleared a key hurdle to fully establish itself in Israel, after the Transportation Ministry announced on February 2 that it had approved Tesla's supervised autonomous driving trials in the country.
This represents the first step towards authorizing the use of Tesla's Full-Self Driving (FSD) system, which allows the cars to operate autonomously with a supervised driver at the wheel.
"The State of Israel leads in innovation with giant steps. Integrating smart autonomous systems on roads, under supervision and control, is another step toward strengthening road safety," said Transportation Minister Miri Regev.
"Israel currently serves as a preferred testing and development arena for advanced vehicle technologies for leading global vehicle manufacturers," added Moshe Ben Zaken, the Transportation Ministry's director general.

ICE shot and killed an American citizen last year new records show
- Ruben Ray Martinez, a 23-year-old American citizen, was fatally shot by a Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent during a traffic stop on South Padre Island, Texas, last March.
- According to an internal ICE incident report, Martinez's car allegedly accelerated and hit an HSI special agent, leading another agent to fire multiple shots through the driver's side window.
- Martinez's mother, Rachel Reyes, confirmed his identity and described him as a "nice, humble guy" who was celebrating his first trip out of town with a friend.
- The Department of Homeland Security stated the agent fired "defensive shots" to protect himself, fellow agents, and the public, with the incident currently under investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety.
- Martinez's death is one of at least six fatal shootings by federal immigration agents since the start of the administration's immigration crackdown, which has faced increasing public disapproval.

Team USA captures record-breaking 11th gold medal at Winter Games
The U.S. Olympic team captured a record-breaking 11th gold medal at the Milano Cortina Winter Games on Saturday, after Kaila Kuhn, Connor Curran and Chris Lillis won the mixed team aerials title.
The 11th gold breaks the record set at the last Olympics on U.S. soil – in Salt Lake City in 2022, which has long stood as a turning point for a Winter sports program that had struggled over previous decades.
The win lifted the U.S. to 30 medals overall for the Olympics. That's second to Norway, which, a day earlier, won its 17th gold medal, setting a Winter Games record.
Team USA could add more gold medals to its tally, including on Sunday when the U.S. men's hockey team takes on Team Canada.
There are 38 more medal events on the program this year than there were in 2002.
Here are some looks and links to the rest of the 11 U.S. gold-medal winners:
Alex Ferreira, freeskiing
American freeskier Alex Ferreira rounds out his Olympic collection with his first gold in Milan. He took silver in Pyeongchang in 2018, and bronze four years ago in Beijing.
Breezy Johnson, Alpine
Her long journey to a gold medal included a knee injury four years ago on the same mountain where she won.
Elizabeth Lemley, moguls
Nicknamed "Lizard," she joins a lexicon of great U.S. moguls skiers, including 2010 champion Hannah Kearney and her teammate, Jaelin Kauf, who now has three silver medals.
Alysa Liu, figure skating
The 20-year-old stepped away after the Beijing Games, rediscovered her love for figure skating and happily claimed the gold medal -- the first for U.S. women since 2002.
Elana Meyers Taylor, bobsled
At her sixth Olympics, she finally broke through, becoming the oldest Winter Olympian to win gold at age 41.
Mikaela Shiffrin, Alpine
The most winning skier of all time cashes in at the Olympics with slalom gold after a tear-stained shutout four years ago.
Jordan Stolz, speedskating (2)
Joined Eric Heiden at Lake Placid in 1980 as only the second man to capture the 500 and 1,000. Goes for a third title Saturday night.
US figure skating team
Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin are among the members of a team that brings home a second straight gold; the last one took two years to capture after the Russian doping saga.
U.S. women's hockey team
A tense thriller, highlighted by Hilary Knight's equalizer with 2:04 left, then Megan Keller's winner in overtime.

Europe’s Defense Buildup Reveals Strategic Divisions

Europe’s uneven rearmament drive risks weakening its own security as national defense strategies diverge and coordination falters across the continent.
As Washington signals a reduced appetite for transatlantic preeminence and Russia expands military production beyond the needs of its war in Ukraine, European governments are increasing defense spending. Yet instead of converging around unified procurement and strategic planning, EU member states are pursuing largely national approaches.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
In a commentary published by Euractiv, this fragmentation creates a widening gap between political rhetoric about unity and the operational reality within Europe.
Spending rises, coordination lags
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly urged Europe to strengthen its defense posture. Speaking in Davos, he said: “Europe needs to know how to defend itself.” He also criticized EU governments for failing to prioritize defense spending before pressure mounted from US President Donald Trump, saying they “were not even trying” to spend 5% of GDP on security.
The problem, however, is not merely the scale of spending. It is the lack of coherence.
While the Trump administration has urged European allies to “take the lead” on regional security threats, rearmament has become a test of collective defense credibility. Yet planning remains uneven, and procurement strategies differ sharply among member states.
France, Germany and Italy – home to Europe’s largest defense manufacturers – have resisted deeper procurement coordination, preferring bilateral arrangements that preserve national industrial control. Such approaches, the article contends, undermine efforts to implement the European Defence Roadmap and dilute strategic coherence.
Pentagon Warns EU Against ‘Buy European’ Arms Push, Threatens Retaliation
Flagship projects stall
The European Drone Wall, presented as a flagship EU initiative to counter Russian hybrid threats, illustrates these divisions. Disputes over technology and governance have stalled the project, leaving it effectively frozen despite its political prominence.
This mismatch between political messaging and military coordination risks generating ambiguity at a time of heightened geopolitical tension.
European leaders have already sent contrasting signals. French President Emmanuel Macron recently cautioned that “we have to remain very cautious and avoid any escalation.” In contrast, Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braže argued that a more “proactive response is needed.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly acknowledged Europe’s military buildup. At the Valdai conference last October, he said Moscow was “closely monitoring the growing militarisation of Europe” and asked: “Is it just rhetoric, or is it time for us to respond?”
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has insisted EU measures are strictly defensive. Yet inconsistent messaging may complicate those assurances in an environment of mutual suspicion.
Diverging procurement strategies
Public support for higher defense spending has increased across Europe, prompting ambitious national timelines. Germany has pledged to become “war capable” by 2029, while NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has warned that the alliance must be prepared for possible conflict within five years.
At the same time, procurement policies remain fragmented. Germany has proposed “Buy European” legislation, France emphasizes domestic production, Poland continues purchasing American fighter jets and tanks, and the Pentagon promotes US arms exports under its “America First” policy.
The result is a patchwork of national decisions that limits Europe’s ability to achieve strategic – let alone operational – coherence despite rising budgets.
Preparing for the wrong threat?
The analysis further suggests Europe may be prioritizing conventional military hardware while underestimating hybrid threats. Any Russian action against NATO territory would likely target critical infrastructure, cyber networks, disinformation ecosystems and economic vulnerabilities rather than large-scale armored offensives.
Despite this, defense investments remain heavily concentrated on traditional weaponry. The mismatch between threat perception and procurement priorities deepens what the piece describes as Europe’s rhetoric-reality gap.
Meanwhile, Baltic and Eastern flank states are reinforcing borders, constructing fortifications and preparing infrastructure for potential conflict. Analysts describe this as a “two-speed alliance,” with frontline states moving toward quasi-war footing while Western Europe debates procurement frameworks.
A December poll found that more than two-thirds of Europeans believe their country would be unable to defend itself militarily against Russia.
Calls for institutional reform
To address these weaknesses, the Euractiv article proposes binding joint procurement mechanisms enforced through budget conditionality, as well as the creation of a permanent EU Defense Industrial Coordination Body with decision-making authority.
It also calls for transparent burden-sharing formulas to replace ad hoc negotiations that have hampered projects such as the Drone Wall.
Without such structural reforms, Europe’s rearmament risks producing fragmentation rather than credible deterrence.

February 21, 2026The US Supreme Court's dramatic decision on Friday to rule most of US President Donald Trump's tariffs illegal has left the country's trade partners trying to figure out what the verdict means for them.
Although Trump says he will press on with tariffs using other statutes, the ruling could halt his flagship trade policy and give countries and sectors affected by the tariffs an unexpected but welcome reprieve.
European leaders have cautiously welcomed the decision.
French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the decision when speaking at an agricultural fair in Paris, saying, "It is good to have power and counterweights to power in democracies." He said France would consider the consequences of the new global tariff announced by Trump. The US president had first announced a global 10% levy but on Saturday said he'd raise the tariff to 15% instead.
The German government said it was in "close contact with the American government to obtain clarifications on the next steps." A trade spokesperson for the European Commission said the 27-nation bloc was in "close contact" with the US administration as they seek clarity on the next steps.
Uncertainty over EU-US trade deal
The verdict has created deep uncertainty over the EU-US trade agreement struck last July. EU lawmakers had paused the ratification process of that deal after Trump's threats to annex Greenland, but the European Parliament's trade committee is due to vote on the deal this coming Tuesday (February 24).
That vote is now in doubt, and EU lawmakers will hold an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the next steps. "The era of unlimited, arbitrary tariffs ... might now be coming to an end," Bernd Lange, chairman of the trade committee, said on X. "We must now carefully evaluate the ruling and its consequences."
That deal, struck in the wake of Trump's so-called 'Liberation Day' tariffs, saw tariffs on most EU goods entering the US fixed at 15%, while the EU agreed to eliminate tariffs on all US industrial goods imported into the EU. Ratification of the deal, widely criticized for being uneven, was expected in March or April, but the Supreme Court decision has left the entire timeline and process in doubt.
"As the EU had put the ratification of its part of the US-EU deal on hold after the Greenland conflict, some European members of parliament might now feel encouraged to continue doing so," Carsten Brzeski, Global Head of Macro for ING Research, wrote in a note. "However, the truth is that the filled toolkit of other tariff options and the new US stance on geopolitics will keep US trading partners in check."
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the government would "honour" deals it had struck with the EU and others, and expected them to do the same. "For a year I've been telling them that regardless of the direction of this litigation, we will impose tariffs at levels that they agree to," he told Fox News.
The UK government, which was the first to strike a tariff deal with the US after Trump's tariff blitz, said it expected its "privileged trading position with the US to continue."
"The UK government is working with the US to understand how the overturning of Donald Trump's tariffs by the Supreme Court will affect the UK," a spokesperson for Downing Street said.
Cautious reaction from German industry
Although the trade pact struck in July was seen by many analysts as uneven from an EU perspective, it had been welcomed by industry leaders, given that it had brought a degree of certainty.
German business leaders have reacted with hope to the latest developments but say the need for clarity remains.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said the Supreme Court ruling was a strong signal for the rules-based trade order but noted that continuing uncertainty over the terms of trade would complicate business for internationally-oriented firms.
"The European Union, with the support of the German government, should quickly approach the United States and clarify the consequences of the recent ruling for the EU-US trade deal. Businesses urgently need planning certainty," said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the executive board.
The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) said uncertainty remained high due to the chance of Trump using other methods to level tariffs. "The US administration still has other instruments for restrictive US trade measures, and German businesses must be prepared for that," said Volker Treier, DIHK's Head of Foreign Trade.
He said it was vital that the EU continued to press for the removal and reduction of tariffs outside the 15% rate, for example, the 50% rates levied on European steel and aluminum.
How different sectors could be hit
The Supreme Court's decision specifically targeted the tariffs Trump enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he used for most of his so-called reciprocal tariffs.
However, some of the industry-specific tariffs that he has imposed in sectors such as steel, aluminium, and automotive were enacted on national security grounds. These tariffs have not been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling. The tariffs imposed on Chinese goods under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 during Trump's first term also remain in force.
Then there's the new tariff he ordered following the Supreme Court ruling. These global 15% levies were issued under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act. Those levies are in addition to sectoral tariffs already charged under different authorities.
Trump has also threatened to start new trade investigations, which could lead to an entirely new set of tariffs.
For instance, European car and car parts manufacturers were subject to a 15% tariff when exporting to the US after the EU-US trade agreement. However, with the future of the deal now in doubt, it is unclear what tariffs they would face. The Trump administration has set a broad rate of 25% on most car imports.
Another sector important to European interests is pharmaceuticals. Although tariffs in that sector have yet to take effect, Trump has repeatedly threatened huge levies. If they were eventually implemented, they would also be implemented under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which lets the president implement tariffs on national security grounds.
"Europe should not be mistaken, this ruling will not bring relief," Brzeski said. "Instead, Section 301 and 232 investigations can target specific sectors more precisely than IEEPA's broad-brush approach. Pharmaceuticals, chemicals, automotive components — all plausible candidates for the next round. The legal authority may be different, but the economic impact could be identical or worse."

Outrage in Italy as toddler dies after transplant with damaged heart

ROME – An Italian toddler who received a damaged donor heart died on Feb 21, in a case that has caused outrage in Italy over alleged medical malpractice.
The two-year-old had received a transplant in December, reportedly with a heart that was damaged during transit by coming into direct contact with dry ice.
Prosecutors are investigating six medical staff.
“It’s over. Domenico’s gone,” the boy’s mother, Ms Patrizia Mercolino, told Italian media.
She said a foundation would be opened in his name.
Her son had been on life support for weeks at a hospital in Naples in a case that has made headlines in Italy.
The donor heart was reportedly transported from Bolzano in northern Italy to Naples – 800km away – in an unsuitable container without a thermometer that could have signalled the excessively low temperature.
Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said in a statement quoted by Italian media that Domenico’s case had “moved the whole of Italy”.
Mr Schillaci earlier spoke of his concern that organ donations could decrease as a result of the case, and called for “clarity” to ensure continued trust in the country’s medical services. AFP

The 21st Goodness Ship loaded with humanitarian aid from the Turkish Red Crescent destined for Gaza reached Al Arish in northeastern Egypt on Saturday after departing from Mersin, Türkiye.
Turkish aid continues to flow into Gaza following the partial reopening of the Rafah border crossing earlier this month after nearly two years of closure, enabling increased humanitarian deliveries amid the ongoing ceasefire.
The latest ship carries some 3,300 tons of humanitarian aid, including 175,000 food parcels along with food items, personal care products, clothing, shelter materials, water, and other essential living supplies.
Upon arrival at Al Arish, the aid materials were received and will be transferred to Gaza via the Rafah border crossing in coordination with the Egyptian Red Crescent.
Since October 7, 2023, the Turkish Red Crescent has delivered humanitarian aid to Gaza through the Goodness Ship initiative.
The aid group is strengthening its solidarity network through collaborations with public institutions and the private sector.
Türkiye has ramped up efforts to send containers to the region, particularly following the reopening of the Rafah Border Crossing on February 2 after a two-year closure, with plans to dispatch an initial 20,000 containers to Gaza.

Thousands of troops from five countries and a $7bn relief fund: Inside Trump’s ‘board of peace’ plan to ‘rebuild’ Gaza
In a long-winded speech in Washington on Thursday, US president revealed more details about his plan for Gaza
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
US president Donald Trump held the first meeting of his “board of peace” this week, in which he outlined his long-awaited plan for Gaza’s reconstruction.
Mr Trump plans to use a $7bn (£5.2bn) reconstruction fund, financed by several countries on the board, to carry out a massive rebuild of the war-torn enclave.
The president laid out the plans at a meeting in Washington DC on Thursday, attended by delegations from 50 countries, including those allies who are notably not members of the board, such as the UK, Germany, Italy, Norway and Switzerland.
The second phase of the Gaza peace plan, signed by Hamas and Israel last October, included the disarmament of the militant group, which Mr Trump said they have agreed to, and the reconstruction of Gaza, which will be overseen by the board.
But there are concerns among Washington’s Western allies about the effectiveness of the board, amid fears it has been set up to replace the UN.
Here’s everything we know so far about Mr Trump’s Gaza peace plan:
What does the Gaza plan involve?
One critical component of the plan is the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to Gaza.
Mr Trump said several nations will send thousands of troops to join the force, including 8,000 personnel pledged by Indonesia. Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania also committed to sending soldiers.
Led by a US general with an Indonesian deputy, the force began operations to train a new police force in Israeli-controlled areas, beginning with Rafah, a major population centre in Gaza which was largely demolished during the war.
The aim will be to prepare 12,000 police officers and deploy 20,000 troops, Mr Trump said. Egypt and Jordan have pledged to help train police.
Major General Jasper Jeffers, who is leading the Stabilisation Force, said the police and troops “help bring the security that Gaza needs for a future of prosperity and enduring peace”.
The disarmament of Hamas, a condition on which Mr Trump’s plan hinges, could still prove to be a contentious issue.
The US president said he hopes force will not be necessary, and claimed Hamas had committed to disarming and “looks like they're going to be doing that, but we'll have to find out".
But the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a stark warning, stating: “Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma – to disarm peacefully or be disarmed forcefully”.
Who is paying for it?
The initial $7bn fund was reportedly contributed by countries including Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan and Kuwait.
Mr Trump said the US would also contribute $10bn to the board, but did not specify from where he would source these funds.
Other pledges include $75m from Fifa for football-related projects and $2bn from the UN for humanitarian assistance.
This falls significantly short of the roughly $70bn required to fully rebuild Gaza, much of which was flattened by Israeli bombardment over two years.
Who is on Trump’s board and why are Western countries not involved?
The board’s membership largely includes Middle Eastern nations, alongside leaders from outside the region who may be seeking to curry favour with Mr Trump.
Israel is a member, but there are no Palestinian representatives included.
Other members include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.
From elsewhere in the world, there is Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, El Salvador, Hungary, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.
The US’s key Western allies and major powers of the Global South such as Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa, have not accepted offers to join.
The leaders of the UK, EU, France, Germany, Norway and Sweden have said they will not join.
Mr Trump even rescinded an invitation for Canada last month after he took issue with prime minister Mark Carney's speech in at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Rights experts said that Mr Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembles a colonial structure, and have criticised the board for not including a Palestinian representative, despite being meant to supervise the temporary governing of a Palestinian territory.
Critics also raised concerns about the former British prime minister Tony Blair's inclusion, given his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

Poland’s premier criticizes Hungary over blocking $106B EU loan to Ukraine
Donald Tusk slams Hungary for blocking European Union loan to support Ukraine, as tensions between Warsaw and Budapest persist
WARSAW
Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Saturday sharply criticized Hungary for blocking a €90 billion ($106 billion) EU loan package intended to support Ukraine’s military and economic needs.
The financial aid package, agreed to by EU leaders in December, was meant to provide Kyiv with budget support and assistance for 2026–2027. The arrangement was approved by the European Parliament and plans to finance the funds through EU borrowing on capital markets backed by the union’s budget — without direct contributions from Hungary, Slovakia, or the Czech Republic.
However, Hungary has withheld its approval of a key amendment to the EU’s long-term budget framework, effectively blocking final adoption of the loan. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Budapest will oppose the loan “until oil transit to Hungary via the Druzhba pipeline resumes,” accusing Ukraine of failing to reopen the route following damage from a Russian drone attack. Hungary claims the stoppage violates the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, a charge Kyiv denies.
Tusk, whose government backed the support package, criticized Hungary’s veto as a threat to European unity and to Ukraine’s ability to sustain its defense against Russian aggression. In previous statements after the December EU summit, he framed the loan — financed from so-called “headroom” in the EU budget — as crucial financing that would not burden Polish taxpayers, emphasizing that Ukraine would ultimately repay the loan when reparations from Russia are available.
The dispute has raised concerns in Brussels that unanimity requirements for certain budget decisions could empower individual member states to block collective initiatives, even when broad support exists among others. The European Commission has stressed it expects all countries to honor the political agreement underpinning the loan, underscoring the importance of unity in maintaining support for Ukraine.
Hungary’s move also comes amid heightened domestic politics — Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government faces elections in April, and its resisting EU sanctions and broader aid to Kyiv aligns with Russian interests. Other EU capitals fear that prolonged blockages could delay or undermine financial assistance at a critical time for Ukraine’s war effort.

ICE begins to purchase warehouses, but some owners are backing out of deals
More than 20 towns with large warehouses have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s $45 billion expansion of detention centers. Some communities complain that ICE isn’t telling them anything until after it has purchased space for thousands of detainees. In some cases, warehouse owners are refusing to sell.
A look at some of the locations:
Arizona
Local officials were told nothing before ICE purchased a 418,000-square-foot (38,833-square-meter) warehouse in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise for $70 million, the state’s top prosecutor, Kris Mayes, said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
Documents later provided by ICE said the Department of Homeland Security estimates it will spend $150 million retrofitting the facility into a 1,500-bed processing site.
Florida
A TV reporter in Orlando spotted private contractors and federal officials last month touring a 439,945-square-foot (40,872-square-meter) industrial warehouse. ICE senior adviser David Venturella told a WFTV reporter the tour was “exploratory.”
Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said in a statement that the city hasn’t been contacted by the federal government and that it has no legal options to stop a possible ICE facility.
Georgia
ICE bought a massive warehouse in Social Circle for $128.6 million. The city said it has been informed that the facility is expected to house from 7,500 to 10,000 detainees and will be constructed using a modular design so that capacity can be scaled up or down as needed.
Plans also are in the works to convert a warehouse in Oakwood into an ICE processing facility, Republican U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde said in a statement, although no deed has been filed. City Manager B.R. White said his first inkling that a deal was imminent came when a warehouse supervisor told a city inspector he’d been instructed to clear the job site to make way for the new owners — the federal government.
Indiana
After the town of Merrillville raised concerns about ICE touring a new 275,000-square-foot (25,548-square-meter) warehouse, owner Opus Holding LLC sent a letter stating it isn’t negotiating with federal officials for the property. The letter said Opus was limited in what it could share because of legal issues.
Maryland
ICE purchased a warehouse about 60 miles (96 kilometers) northwest of Baltimore for $102.4 million, a deed signed last month shows. The deed was unearthed by Project Salt Box, a Maryland ICE watchdog.
Officials in Washington County said in a Facebook post that DHS notified them beforehand that it was considering purchasing the warehouse for use as a “new ICE Baltimore Processing Facility.” County commissioners later passed a resolution in support of ICE activities.
Michigan
ICE announced its purchase of a facility in Romulus after the deal was completed. The city responded in a Facebook post that officials were concerned about the “lack of prior notification.”
Minnesota
The owners of warehouses in the Minneapolis suburbs of Woodbury and Shakopee pulled out of possible ICE deals after public outcry, according to local officials.
Mississippi
Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker posted that Noem agreed to look elsewhere after local elected and zoning officials opposed a possible detention center in the town of Byhalia.
Missouri
After weeks of public pressure, development company Platform Ventures announced it would not move forward with the sale of a massive warehouse in Kansas City.
New Hampshire
Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte sparred with federal officials after ICE disclosed plans to spend $158 million to convert a warehouse in Merrimack into a 500-bed processing center.
The issue came to a head when interim ICE Director Todd Lyons testified that DHS “has worked with Gov. Ayotte” and provided her with an economic impact summary.
Ayotte said the assertion was “simply not true.” She said the summary was sent hours after Lyons testified. The document erroneously refers to the “ripple effects to the Oklahoma economy” and revenue generated by state sales and income taxes, neither of which exist in New Hampshire.
New Jersey
Roxbury said Friday that ICE had closed on the sale of a warehouse despite it offering tax abatements to the owner to stop the purchase.
No property documents were yet available online showing the price of the sale. The announcement came just two days after ICE said it had made a “mistake” when it previously announced the purchase.
“Let us be clear: Roxbury Township will not passively accept this outcome,” the mayor and city council wrote in a news release.
New York
ICE said Tuesday it made a mistake when it announced the purchase of a vacant warehouse in Chester. New York state Assemblyman Brian Maher said Friday that ICE is no longer considering the facility.
Oklahoma
Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt announced last month that property owners had informed him they are no longer engaged with DHS about a potential acquisition or lease of a warehouse.
Pennsylvania
DHS purchased a warehouse in Tremont Township for $119.5 million and one in Upper Bern Township for $87.4 million. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has said his administration will fight DHS’ plans to convert the warehouses in rural parts of eastern Pennsylvania into immigrant detention and processing centers.
Texas
In the El Paso suburb of Socorro, ICE paid $122.8 million for a trio of warehouses that span 826,780 square feet (76,810 square meters). ICE also paid $66.1 million for a 639,595-square-foot (59,420-square-meter) warehouse in San Antonio. The mayors of both cities are opposed.
However, another deal in the state was scuttled following community backlash. In the Dallas suburb of Hutchins, a real estate company confirmed that it was contacted about one of its properties but wouldn’t sell or lease any buildings to DHS for use as a detention facility. California-based Majestic Realty Co. provided no explanation in its statement.
Utah
Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall expressed gratitude in her State of the City address that the owners of a warehouse that ICE was eying as a detention facility had announced plans not to sell or lease the property to the federal government.
Virginia
Jim Pattison Developments said in a statement last month that it became aware of the intended use of a warehouse in the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, after agreeing to sell to a U.S. government contractor. Following boycott threats, the Vancouver-based company announced that the transaction “will not be proceeding.”

White House dinner closes a turbulent week for governors in Washington
White House dinner closes a turbulent week for governors in Washington
WASHINGTON (AP) — The annual dinner with governors at the White House is typically a chance for leaders from both parties to come together, socialize and spend a low-key evening with the president. But like many traditions during President Donald Trump’s second term, Saturday’s dinner has proven unusually controversial.
Ahead of this week’s gathering of the National Governors Association, Trump ridiculed the bipartisan group’s leadership, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Democratic Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland. He refused to invite Moore, along with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, to a working event at the White House on Friday — only to relent at the last minute.
Even then, the event was cut short when Trump learned of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down his sweeping tariff policy, leaving even some Republicans frustrated by the week’s turbulence.
“It was unfortunate that the Supreme Court came out with a bad ruling at that time,” said Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican and top Trump ally.
Dozens of Democrats had threatened to boycott the dinner if members of their party were blocked from the working meeting. But even after Moore’s attendance, some said they still wouldn’t show up Saturday.
“President Trump has made this whole thing a farce,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement explaining her decision to skip the dinner.
For all the turmoil surrounding the dinner, some Democrats said Friday’s meeting was useful. Moore said it offered a “chance for us to be able to share our thoughts and our perspectives and our ideas.”
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said governors asked Trump what lessons were learned from the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement in Minnesota, in which two U.S. citizens were killed within weeks of each other.
“The President said, ‘We’ll only go where we’re wanted,” Hochul said approvingly.
Those who have attended previous dinners said they offered a rare and helpful opportunity for governors to connect with the president and members of his Cabinet away from the pressure of daily governing. Some also said the dinner was a chance to connect with fellow governors from other parties whom they might not see very often.
Asa Hutchinson, the former Republican governor of Arkansas who briefly challenged Trump for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, recalled being assigned to a table one year with then-Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo and getting to know her family.
“It’s a glowing evening in the White House,” Hutchinson, who once chaired the NGA, said in an interview.

ICE is quietly buying warehouses for detention centers and leaving local officials out of the loop

ICE’s purchases for big detention centers are marked by secrecy, frustrating towns
ICE’s purchases for big detention centers are marked by secrecy, frustrating towns
SOCORRO, Texas (AP) — In a Texas town at the edge of the Rio Grande and a tall metal border wall, rumors swirled that federal immigration officials wanted to purchase three hulking warehouses to transform into a detention center.
As local officials scrambled to find out what was happening, a deed was filed showing the Department of Homeland Security had already inked a $122.8 million deal for the 826,000-square-foot (76,738-square-meter) warehouses in Socorro, a bedroom community of 40,000 people outside El Paso.
“Nobody from the federal government bothered to pick up the phone or even send us any type of correspondence letting us know what’s about to take place,” said Rudy Cruz Jr., the mayor of the predominantly Hispanic town of low-slung ranch homes and trailer parks, where orchards and irrigation ditches share the landscape with strip malls, truck stops, recycling plants and distribution warehouses.
Socorro is among at least 20 communities with large warehouses across the U.S. that have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s $45-billion expansion of detention centers.
As public support for the agency and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown sags, communities are objecting to mass detentions and raising concerns that the facilities could strain water supplies and other services while reducing local tax revenue. In many cases, mayors, county commissioners, governors and members of Congress learned about ICE’s ambitions only after the agency bought or leased space for detainees, leading to shock and frustration even in areas that have backed Trump.
“I just feel,” said Cruz, whose wife was born in Mexico, “that they do these things in silence so that they don’t get opposition.”
Communities scramble for information
ICE, which is part of DHS, has purchased at least seven warehouses in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas, signed deeds show. Other deals have been announced but not yet finalized, though buyers scuttled sales in eight locations.
DHS objected to calling the sites warehouses, stressing in a statement that they would be “very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”
The process has been chaotic at times. ICE this past week acknowledged it made a “mistake” when it announced warehouse purchases in Chester, New York, and Roxbury, New Jersey. Roxbury then announced Friday that the sale there had closed.
DHS has confirmed it is looking for more detention space but hasn’t disclosed individual sites ahead of acquisitions. Some cities learned that ICE was scouting warehouses through reporters. Others were tipped off by a spreadsheet circulating online among activists whose source is unclear.
It wasn’t until Feb. 13 that the scope of the warehouse project was confirmed, when the governor’s office in New Hampshire, where there is backlash to a planned 500-bed processing center, released a document from ICE showing the agency plans to spend $38.3 billion to boost detention capacity to 92,000 beds.
Since Trump took office, the number of people detained by ICE has increased to 75,000 from 40,000, spread across more than 225 sites.
ICE could use the warehouses to consolidate and to increase capacity. The document describes a project that includes eight large-scale detention centers, capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 detainees each, and 16 smaller regional processing centers. The document also refers to the acquisition of 10 existing “turnkey” facilities.
The project is funded through the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Congress last year that nearly doubled DHS’ budget. To build the detention centers, the Trump administration is using military contracts.
Those contracts allow a lot of secrecy and for DHS to move quickly without following the usual processes and safeguards, said Charles Tiefer, a professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School.
Socorro facility could be among the largest
In Socorro, the ICE-owned warehouses are so large that 4 1/2 Walmart Supercenters could fit inside, standing in contrast to the remnants of the austere Spanish colonial and mission architecture that defines the town.
At a recent City Council meeting, public comments stretched for hours. “I think a lot of innocent people are getting caught up in their dragnet,” said Jorge Mendoza, an El Paso County retiree whose grandparents immigrated from Mexico.
Many speakers invoked concerns about three recent deaths at an ICE detention facility at the nearby Fort Bliss Army base.
Communities fear a financial hit
Even communities that backed Trump in 2024 have been caught off guard by ICE’s plans and have raised concerns.
In rural Pennsylvania’s Berks County, commissioner Christian Leinbach called the district attorney, the sheriff, the jail warden and the county’s head of emergency services when he first heard ICE might buy a warehouse in Upper Bern Township, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from his home.
No one knew anything.
A few days later, a local official in charge of land records informed him that ICE had bought the building — promoted by developers as a “state-of-the art logistics center” — for $87.4 million.
“There was absolutely no warning,” Leinbach said during a meeting in which he raised concerns that turning the warehouse into a federal facility means a loss of more than $800,000 in local tax dollars.
ICE has touted the income taxes its workers would pay, though the facilities themselves will be exempt from property taxes.
A Georgia detention center could house twice the population of the city where it’s located
In Social Circle, Georgia, which also strongly supported Trump in 2024, officials were stunned by ICE’s plans for a facility that could hold 7,500 to 10,000 people after first learning about it through a reporter.
The city, which has a population of just 5,000 and worries about the infrastructure needs for such a detention center, only heard from DHS after the $128.6 million sale of a 1 million-square-foot (92,900-square-meter) warehouse was completed. Like Socorro and Berks County, Social Circle questioned whether the water and sewage system could keep up.
ICE has said it did due diligence to ensure the sites don’t overwhelm city utilities. But Social Circle said the agency’s analysis relied on a yet-to-be built sewer treatment plant.
“To be clear, the City has repeatedly communicated that it does not have the capacity or resources to accommodate this demand, and no proposal presented to date has demonstrated otherwise,” the city said in a statement.
And in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise, officials sent a scathing letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after ICE without warning bought a massive warehouse in a residential area about a mile from a high school. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, raised the prospect of going to court to have the site declared a public nuisance.
Crowds wait to speak in Socorro
Back in Socorro, people waiting to speak against the ICE facility spilled out of the City Council chambers, some standing beside murals paying tribute to the World War II-era Braceros Program that allowed Mexican farmworkers to be guest workers in the U.S. The program stoked Socorro’s economy and population before President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration in the 1950s began mass deportations aimed at people who had crossed the border illegally.
Eduardo Castillo, formerly an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, told city officials it is intimidating but “not impossible” to challenge the federal government.
“If you don’t at least try,” he said, “you will end up with another inhumane detention facility built in your jurisdiction and under your watch.”

Herzliya mayor warns beaches may close after cliff collapses

A portion of a cliff at Sydney Ali Beach in Herzliya collapsed on Saturday, escalating a growing threat to Israel’s coastal areas.
No injuries were reported.
While the affected area was already closed to the public, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) has issued warnings about the increased risk of further collapses along the coastline, stretching from Palmachim to Hadera.
The INPA clarified that the area in question is permanently closed due to an ongoing risk of collapse. "This collapse ... pertains to an area that has long been under threat," said a representative from INPA.
The public is urged to stay away from the affected area and to adhere to safety protocols. Visitors should avoid the cliffs and heed the warning signs posted throughout the area, the INPA said.
A growing danger along the entire coastal strip
The collapse in Herzliya highlights a broader, unresolved issue. There is an immediate and ongoing risk of more cliff collapses along the entire coastal strip, from central Israel to the north. The INPA warned that the threat is likely to intensify, particularly as cliff rehabilitation efforts have lagged in recent years.
"We are on the verge of closing Herzliya’s beaches," Herzliya Mayor Yair Fischer said after Saturday's incident. "This collapse is not an isolated incident but the result of years of neglect and insufficient funding for the national coastal cliff protection program," he added.
Fischer further stated that the city will not take any chances with public safety, adding that if immediate solutions are not implemented, the municipality may have no choice but to close more sections of the beach. "We cannot afford to wait for a disaster. The responsibility is national, and so must be the solution," he asserted.
The national implications of the collapse
Cliff collapses have become an increasing concern along Israel’s coastline, particularly in areas popular with tourists and locals alike. The collapse at Sydney Ali Beach is part of a wider pattern of incidents in recent years, with coastal cliffs across the country slowly crumbling, according to INPA.
The risk of further collapses presents not only a serious threat to human safety but also endangers the health of Israel’s coastal environment and natural beach areas. According to the INPA, many of Israel's beaches are at risk of collapse due to natural factors such as soil erosion, climate change, and the lack of effective coastal defense planning.
Fischer highlighted the urgent need for national funding to address the rehabilitation of the cliffs. "The solutions must be national, not just local," Fischer stated, stressing the national importance of addressing the issue without delay.
"Without immediate action and national-level rehabilitation efforts, both public safety and Israel’s coastal environment remain at risk."

'Death to Khamenei': protests erupt at Tehran universities | Watch

Protests broke out Saturday at two universities in Tehran on the first day of the academic semester, according to videos circulated from Iran and reports by Iran International, a channel affiliated with opponents of the regime.
At Amirkabir University, demonstrators blocked a nearby street, the report said. At Sharif University of Technology, clashes were reported between students and members of the Basij, a militia subordinate to the Revolutionary Guard. Protesters there were heard chanting “Death to Khamenei,” referring to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
While the demonstrations did not appear to be large-scale, they come weeks after a sweeping crackdown on nationwide protests. U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that 32,000 people were killed in last month’s unrest, though that figure has not been independently verified. Since the crackdown by security forces, there have been no reports of significant demonstrations, although chants against the regime have been heard at funerals for those killed.
The renewed campus protests unfold at a particularly sensitive time for Tehran, amid escalating tensions with Washington. Trump has threatened military action if Iran does not agree to a deal limiting its nuclear and missile programs and ending support for militant groups across the Middle East.
Trump has given Tehran what he described as a “10 to 15 day” ultimatum. Iranian officials have said they plan to present a draft proposal in the coming days. At the same time, the United States has continued preparations for a potential strike.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that his country would not bow to pressure from world powers during nuclear talks with the United States.
“World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads, but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems they are creating for us,” Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live on state television.
The aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was photographed crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and entering the Mediterranean Sea, about 3,700 kilometers from Israel. According to reports, the carrier — the largest and most advanced in the U.S. fleet — is expected to be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, near Israel, as part of efforts to bolster defenses of Israel and U.S. bases in the region in the event of war with Iran.
The New York Times reported that the United States currently has between 30,000 and 40,000 troops stationed at 13 bases across the Middle East, which Iran has threatened to target if Trump orders an attack.
Satellite images published by the newspaper showed significant reinforcements at Muwaffaq al-Salti Air Base in Jordan, about 100 kilometers east of Amman. According to the report, images captured by an Airbus satellite indicate more than 60 strike aircraft at the base, including F-35 stealth jets, as well as 68 cargo aircraft that have arrived since Sunday. Additional fighter jets were seen under protective shelters, alongside drones and helicopters. U.S. forces were also observed installing new air defense systems in preparation for a potential Iranian missile attack. The Times described the base as becoming a “key hub” in preparations for possible military action.
Jordan has said it will not allow its territory to serve as a launch point for military action against Iran, but has warned it would respond to violations of its airspace. Jordanian officials told the newspaper that U.S. aircraft and equipment sent to the base are part of a defense agreement with Washington and expressed hope that negotiations would avert war.
Yedioth Ahronoth and ynet military and security analyst Ron Ben-Yishai wrote that if countries such as Qatar refuse to allow strikes to be launched from their territory, the United States would face difficulties conducting sorties from Al-Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. air base in the region. He wrote that this helps explain the decision to move additional naval and air assets into the area, including shifting significant air and ground forces to Jordan and other friendly states.
According to Ben-Yishai, the buildup could soon include about 250 fighter-bombers of various types — roughly 150 aboard aircraft carriers — along with about 70 refueling planes and 30 early warning, intelligence and electronic warfare aircraft. The United States is also deploying Patriot and THAAD air defense batteries to the region.
In addition to air assets, the naval presence is expanding. AFP reported that the force will include two aircraft carriers, 12 guided missile destroyers and three warships designed for operations in shallow coastal waters. The strike groups are also believed to include submarines armed with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of about 1,700 kilometers.
The concentration of U.S. forces marks the largest buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. According to reports, U.S. forces are already prepared, or will soon be prepared, for a broad campaign against Iran. Trump said Friday he is considering a “limited strike” that could pressure Tehran in negotiations. Iranian officials have warned that any attack, even a limited one, would ignite a regional war, including strikes on U.S. bases and missile barrages on cities in Israel.
Washington has said it still prefers diplomacy. Trump said within 10 to 15 days it will become clear whether an agreement can be reached to prevent war. Officials in Israel have expressed concern that any deal might focus solely on the nuclear program without addressing Iran’s extensive missile program, which Tehran has refused to include in talks.
Ben-Yishai wrote that Pentagon officials, along with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior defense officials who recently traveled to Washington, have argued that a short, intense operation would not achieve strategic objectives. Such a strike, he wrote, would at most delay nuclear development and would not fundamentally alter or topple the ruling system. He assessed that Trump may instead favor a prolonged campaign lasting weeks rather than a brief, powerful blow.

'What is, ultimately, the point of sending humans into space?'

When asked about the relevance of sending "a woman" into space, French astronaut Sophie Adenot replied: "I don't think exploration has a gender." This poorly-framed, even slightly misogynistic, question gives rise to a more interesting one: what is, ultimately, the point of sending humans into space? In reading Une histoire de la conquête spatiale ("A History of Space Exploration," 2024) by Irénée Régnauld and Arnaud Saint-Martin, six decades of orbital odysseys struggle to provide an answer to this costly question.
In the early 1960s, the first astronauts occupied a position not so different from the dogs and primates that preceded them. At one point, there was even consideration of drugging them and sending them under general anesthesia: both to spare them the jolts of liftoff and to prevent them from pressing the wrong button. The installation of a window in the first Mercury capsules was a matter of debate: engineers saw little point, since test pilots actually had nothing to pilot. Crewed flight served as a cover for the far more strategic intercontinental missile program. President Dwight Eisenhower was not fooled: When told about the Apollo project, he joked about the lack of American enemies on the Moon.
Scientists also voiced their reservations. James Van Allen, a true space pioneer and discoverer of Earth's radiation belts thanks to the Explorer 1 scientific satellite, described the human in space in 1959 as "a fabulous nuisance." Astronauts' bodies move and give off heat and gases that disrupt measurements. Numerous devices that vibrate, let off heat and are very heavy are also required, reducing the rocket's payload capacity. Compared to an automated probe, a crew requires very expensive systems and wants to return safely to Earth, further increasing the weight and the bill. In the 1970s, the Apollo program faced heavy criticism from the American scientific elite, notably from double Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, both for its extraordinary cost – up to 4.5% of the US federal budget – and for the equally extraordinary weakness of its scientific results.

South Korean parliament to proceed with US investment bill despite court ruling on Trump tariffs
Lawmakers say legislative process will continue as planned
ISTANBUL
South Korea’s ruling and opposition parties said Saturday they will proceed with the remaining legislative procedures related to the country’s investment pledges to the US, despite a recent Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, local media reported.
Lawmakers said the court’s decision does not affect Seoul’s planned investments under a previously agreed trade framework with Washington.
“The ruling does not appear to constitute grounds to cancel South Korea’s investments in the United States,” Kim Sang-hoon of the opposition People Power Party said. Kim also heads a special National Assembly committee overseeing the legislation.
He added that the Assembly will hold hearings as scheduled and review the government’s position regarding the court decision.
The ruling Democratic Party likewise expressed its intention to move forward with the bill, stressing that the agreement with Washington remains valid.
“No changes in schedule are expected in processing the special bill on South Korea’s investment pledges to the US,” a senior Democratic Party official told Yonhap News Agency. “We plan to review the legislation in a calm and orderly manner.”
However, the minor Jinbo Party called for an immediate suspension of all procedures related to the investment bill.
Earlier this month, the National Assembly adopted a resolution to establish a special parliamentary committee to expedite legislation related to South Korea’s $350 billion investment commitment to the US. The pledge followed a trade agreement reached between the two countries.
The move came after Trump threatened to raise tariffs on South Korean goods to 25% from the previously agreed 15%, citing delays in Seoul’s legislative process.

Germany’s ruling party backs social media curbs for children
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
STUTTGART, Germany – Germany’s ruling conservatives on Feb 21 passed a motion to ban social media use for those under 14 and introduce more stringent digital verification checks for teenagers, adding to momentum for such limits in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.
At a party conference in the city of Stuttgart, Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union also called for fines for online platforms that fail to enforce such limits and for European Union-wide harmonisation of age standards.
A growing number of countries, including Spain, Greece, France and Britain, are looking at similar social media bans
It follows the example of Australia, which in 2025 became the first country to force platforms to cut off access for those under 16
European nations are more broadly ratcheting up pressure on social media companies, risking a backlash from the US. US President Donald Trump has threatened tariffs and sanctions if EU countries impose new tech taxes or online regulations that hit US firms.
“We call on the federal government to introduce a legal age limit of 14 for the use of social networks and to address the special need for protection in the digital sphere up to the age of 16,” the motion said.
Mr Merz’s coalition partners, the Social Democrats, have also backed social media curbs for children. Pressure from both parties in the coalition makes it increasingly likely that the federal government will push for restrictions.
But under Germany’s federal system, media regulation is a state‑level responsibility, and states must negotiate with each other to agree on consistent nationwide rules.
Schoolchildren in Bonn discuss the ban
The ban could affect children such as those at the Cardinal Frings Gymnasium in the city of Bonn, several of whom were seen scrolling on their phones on the school grounds a day earlier.
“I think it’s fair, but I think it should be up to the parents to decide whether to forbid it, not the state,” said 13-year-old Moritz, who said he only watches YouTube.
“For children under 12 it should be forbidden, but from age 12 onwards, I think children can already distinguish between what is fake news and what is not.”
His classmate Emma, 13, almost exclusively uses Snapchat but has a time limit on her phone.
A ban would be “kind of unusual, because you get used to sending your snap in the morning before school, or what my friends do, like just scrolling through Instagram or TikTok for a bit,” she said.
Ella, 12, scrolls through social media several times a day.
“So I have TikTok and Instagram myself, but I understand that it’s all addictive, and the more you scroll, the more you want to see.”
Teacher Till Franke said that for many of the children, “it would be a shock at first, because of this daily use of social media”.
But eventually, the students would get used to it, he said, “because they would find other niches where they could communicate with each other”. REUTERS

Ukraine finishes its participation in Winter Olympics for third time without single medal
Ukrainian athletes have completed their performances at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo (Italy).
Ukraine was represented at the 2026 Olympics by 46 athletes who earned licenses in 11 winter sports: biathlon (10), alpine skiing (2), Nordic combined (2), cross-country skiing (6), luge (10), skeleton (1), snowboarding (1), ski jumping (2), freestyle skiing (9), figure skating (1) and short track speed skating (2).
In its debut year of 1994, Ukraine sent 37 athletes to the Winter Olympics, followed by 56 in 1998, a record 70 in 2002, 53 in 2006, 47 in 2010, 43 in 2014, 33 in 2018 and 45 in 2022.
Over those years, Ukrainian athletes won three gold, two silver and four bronze medals at the Winter Olympics.
Ukraine won one gold and one bronze in 1994, one silver in 1998, two bronze in 2006, one gold and one bronze in 2014, one gold in 2018 and one silver in 2022. The country won no medals in 2002 or 2010.
The 2026 Olympics also ended without a Ukrainian medal.
Before the Games, Ukrainian Olympic Committee President Vadym Gutzeit said that seeing the Ukrainian flag at the Olympics was already a victory.
Ukrainian Minister of Youth and Sports Matviy Bidny noted that Ukrainian athletes faced all the difficulties associated with the war during their preparation for the Winter Games. He also said that in addition to their training, the athletes needed a bit of luck.
The Winter Olympics in Italy was marked by several incidents involving the Ukrainian team. Ukrainian skeleton athlete and national team flag bearer Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified before his first run for intending to compete wearing a "helmet of remembrance" bearing photographs of Ukrainian athletes who died in the war.
The International Skating Union also barred Ukrainian short track speed skater Oleh Handei from competing in his own equipment, which included a helmet featuring a quote from Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko: "Where there is heroism, there is no final defeat." His experience mirrored that of Ukrainian snowboarder Kateryna Kotsar, whose helmet was banned for bearing the inscription "Be brave like Ukrainian."

Iranian Students Chant Anti-Government Slogans, Clash With Security Forces In Tehran

Iranian students chanting anti-government slogans faced off with security forces outside a Tehran university, according to social media videos and other reports.
The protest erupted on February 21 outside Sharif University as students confronted soldiers from the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force that has played a prominent role in quashing past political protests.
The students could be heard chanting "Shame, shame," according to video published by the Khabar-e Daneshjoo student news agency and elsewhere. Others could be seen waving the Iranian national flag.
A similar rally was reported at the Amir Kabir University of Technology.
Fars, a semiofficial news agency that is close to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, reported "a similar gathering was held at Tehran University with a number of students present."
The demonstrations coincided with hundreds of ceremonies that have been held across the country this week commemorating victims killed during major clashes with security forces in January.
At least 7,000 people were killed during the nationwide protests that erupted in late December 2025, according to human rights groups, although the real death toll is believed to be significantly higher.
Most of the killings reportedly occurred from January 8 to 10, the peak of the crackdown.
The protests, which have since subsided, were among the largest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Historically, memorial ceremonies have often taken on political significance during times of unrest in Iran.
The protests have drawn global attention and condemnation of the brutal crackdown by government forces.
Amnesty International said at least 30 Iranians were facing the death penalty in connection with the protests.
US President Donald Trump has warned Tehran against further violence against demonstrators, and threatened military actions against the regime.
Trump dispatched two aircraft carrier strike groups, with dozens of fighter jets and bombers to the region, and other military planes and supporting forces have been spotted flying into airbases in the Middle East.
The Trump administration has also been pressuring Iran to agree to curtail its nuclear programs which it insists are intended for peaceful, civilian purposes, like electricity generation. Washington, along with Israel, have accused Tehran of intending to build atomic weapons.
In a speech broadcast live by state TV, Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian said his country would not give in to pressure from world powers.
"World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads...but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us," Pezeshkian said.
US and Israel forces bombed several Iranian facilities believed to house key components of Tehran's nuclear infrastructure. But it was unclear how much the bombing set back its programs.
Trump said he was mulling a limited military strike.
"I guess I can say I am considering that," he said during a White House gathering on February 20.
Serbia and Sweden became the latest countries to urge their citizens to leave Iran amid the massive US buildup.

Slovakia's Fico threatens to halt electricity supplies to Ukraine as Russian oil dispute escalates

Slovakia, Hungary threaten to halt electricity supplies to Ukraine as Russian oil dispute escalates
Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have threatened to cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine during a dire energy crisis amid an escalating dispute over Russian oil flows to central Europe on Feb. 21.
Fico and Orban accuse Kyiv of halting Russian oil transport via the Druzbha pipeline, after Russian strikes damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure in late January. He claims Ukraine is deliberately stalling repairs and the restarting of the pipeline, which carries Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia — the last two EU states dependent on Russian crude.
"If the Ukrainian President does not resume oil supplies to Slovakia on Monday, on that same day I will ask the relevant Slovak companies to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine," Fico wrote on X.
"In January 2026 alone, these emergency supplies, needed to stabilize the Ukrainian energy grid, were required twice as much as during the entire year of 2025."
Orban also told reporters at an event in the city of Békéscsaba that he also doesn't rule out cutting electricity to Ukraine if oil flows don't resume, according to Hungarian media Telex. "If we stop that, bad things could happen," he said.
With Russian strikes tearing apart Ukraine's power plants, the country is in the grips of a severe energy crisis. Last month, Ukraine drastically increased electricity from the EU, overseen by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENSOE).
Slovakia makes up some 17% of Ukraine’s electricity imports, Ukraine’s state-grid operator, Ukrenergo, told the Kyiv Independent. Hungary has a much higher share at around 45%, according to RBC Ukraine.
Hungary and Slovakia have previously followed through with their threats, including earlier this week when they stopped diesel exports to Ukraine. However, if Slovakia does cut off emergency electricity supplies on Feb. 23, it would be breaking energy market rules, said Polish energy expert Wojciech Jakobik.
"It would be costly for Slovakia to do it in an uncoordinated manner because it is not only about bilateral energy trade, but also European-Ukrainian trade. We are on the same market that is ruled by open access to the grids, and it is regulated by multiple rules," he told the Kyiv Independent.
"Slovakia could do something on its own on a technical level, but it is questionable on the basis of common energy policy and international relations."
Ukraine's Energy Ministry declined to comment on the issue.
Budapest and Bratislava have sought alternative routes, asking Croatia to facilitate deliveries via the Adria pipeline. Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said Zagreb refused to transport Russian oil.
The Druzhba pipeline, one of the world's largest oil networks with a capacity of about two million barrels per day, remains a critical supply route for Hungary and Slovakia.
Ukraine has argued that continued reliance on Russian energy undermines efforts to cut off funding for Moscow's war, while Russian strikes — and Kyiv's own attacks on energy infrastructure inside Russia — have further complicated the pipeline's future.

Indigenous protesters occupy Cargill's Santarem port terminal in Brazil

RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 21 - Indigenous protesters have occupied Cargill's Santarem river port terminal in Brazil's Para state and "completely" interrupted operations at the site, the U.S. grain trader said in a statement on Saturday.
The protesters forced Cargill employees to evacuate the private terminal on Friday evening, the firm said, adding that it is in contact with local authorities for an eviction to be carried out "in an orderly and safe manner."
Cargill shipped more than 5.5 million metric tons of soybeans and corn through Santarem last year, according to port sector data. The exported volume, originating mainly from Brazil's Center West region, represented more than 70% of the total grain volume handled at Santarem.
Cargill said there is "strong evidence of vandalism and damage to assets" at the terminal.
The occupation marks an escalation between the protesters and the firm over proposed plans to dredge local rivers, like Tapajos, where grains like soy and corn are moved before reaching export markets.
Cargill has said it has no control over plans to dredge the rivers.
The protesters had been blocking trucks from accessing the terminal since January 22, with only a limited impact on Cargill's operations, as most of the grains arrive by barge before being hauled onto ships for export.
In a letter following the occupation, the protesters demanded that Brazil's government reconsider a decree they said would open up Amazon rivers to dredging.
"Rivers are not export channels: they are a source of life, sustenance, memory, and identity for thousands of families," said the letter, adding that dredging would impact water quality and the fishing they rely on to survive.
Brazil's government did not immediately reply to a request for comment. It said previously that dredging is a routine matter to ensure river traffic during low water level periods. REUTERS

Gunmen kill at least 38 in attack in northwest Nigeria

At least 38 people were killed when armed attackers raided a village in northwestern Zamfara state overnight, police and local officials said Saturday.
Zamfara State, like many northern states, is plagued by insecurity from many sources, including armed gangs locally called "bandits" who loot villages and kidnap residents, and a spreading extremist threat, with groups in the northwest extending their reach southward.
The latest attack occurred in the night of Thursday into Friday in the remote village, which had "few access routes" said Yazid Abubakar, spokesperson for the Zamfara police, adding: "Right now, normalcy has been restored in the area."
According to Hamisu Faru, a local legislator, who reported 50 deaths from the attack, "the bandits came from Gando forest. They laid siege on Dutse Dan Ajiya and opened indiscriminate fire, killing any resident who tried to flee."
Armed gangs are based in the forests straddling the states of Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi, and Niger, from where they launch attacks on villages.
The Nigerian army has been beefing up its deployment to the region for several years to combat these groups, but the violence continues.
The rising violence by armed groups and bandits in Nigeria has drawn the attention of the United States in recent months.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who frames much of the violence as "persecution" or even "genocide" of Christians, ordered surprise airstrikes in coordination with Nigerian authorities on Christmas Day in Sokoto State in the north.
Most experts say that both Christians and Muslims have been equally affected by the violence.
Since 2009, the insurgency in Nigeria, led primarily by Boko Haram and its rival faction, the Daesh West Africa Province (ISWAP), has left more than 40,000 dead and two million displaced in the northeast of the country, according to the U.N.
The recent attack in Zamfara State came the day after attacks on seven villages in neighbouring Kebbi State by the Lakurawa group, which killed dozens of people, according to police and a confidential security report seen by AFP.
In recent years, the emergence of Lakurawa in the northwest has exacerbated violence in the region, forcing the governments of the affected states to recruit more self-defense militias.
Some researchers link Lakurawa to Daesh in the Sahel, which is primarily active in Mali and neighbouring Niger, although others remain sceptical.
Meanwhile, Nigeria's "bandits" gangs, primarily motivated by money, have strengthened their cooperation with armed groups.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy imposes new sanctions on Russia
Sanctions set to affect 46 Russian nationals, 2 Iranians, and 44 Russian companies and 225 captains of various nationalities
MOSCOW
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday imposed new sanctions targeting Russian firms and individuals linked to Moscow.
The new measures target those who supply, develop, produce, or maintain equipment, electronics, and parts for Russia's defense industry, said an official statement.
"The package includes 46 Russian citizens, 2 Iranian citizens, and 44 Russian companies servicing Russia's military-industrial complex," it said.
Kyiv alleges the Iranians helped bypass restrictions by supplying aircraft parts.
The sanctions also target 225 ship captains accused of exporting Russian oil products. The captains come from 11 nations, including Russia, India, and the Philippines.
The measures come just days before the Ukraine war, which began in 2022, is due to hit the four-year mark on Tuesday.

Calls for better supervision of Hong Kong’s campsites after areas inundated
While authorities have stepped up patrols in recent days, improvements in public education and limits on crowds needed, campers and hikers say
A visit by the South China Morning Post on Saturday to Ham Tin Wan, a beach in Sai Kung, found about 50 visitors and 30 tents. Empty plastic bottles, used tissue paper and chocolate wrappers were seen lying on the sand and in bushes and shrubs.
Officers from the Agricultural, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) were out in force inspecting the site and telling campers to take their litter home.
At a public toilet, scraps of food and rice clogged the sink and covered the floor before cleaners arrived, despite signs that said the basins were not for discarding food or washing utensils.
“If you educate people better and raise awareness, you do not have to spend so much manpower on cleaning,” said a 54-year-old local clerk who gave his name as Wong.
“If … [officials] tally the number of people at campsites, set a cap and divert extra foot traffic to other campsites, wouldn’t this be more effective?”

Year Five of War: Ukraine's Other Battlefield in the Global South

Year Five of War: Ukraine's Other Battlefield in the Global South
Beyond the Euro-Atlantic Consensus
As Russia's full-scale invasion enters its fifth year, Ukraine has shown extraordinary resilience. On the battlefield, Ukrainian forces have denied Moscow a decisive victory. At home, society continues to function despite daily attacks. Diplomatically, despite uncertainties coming from Washington, Kyiv has secured strong political, military, and financial backing from most of Europe and North America.
Yet, beyond the Euro-Atlantic space, the picture is more complex. In much of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, Ukraine has often encountered cautious engagement rather than clear political alignment. Many governments have condemned violations of sovereignty in principle, but have avoided deeper engagement.
When War Becomes Routine
As the war enters its fifth year, another structural challenge emerges: normalization. In the first months of Russia's full-scale invasion, images of destroyed cities and displaced civilians dominated global headlines. Today, particularly in regions geographically distant from Europe, the war increasingly risks becoming part of the background of international politics. It risks being absorbed into a crowded global agenda marked by conflicts in the Middle East, tensions surrounding Iran, and intensifying US–China rivalry.
This normalization does not necessarily signal support for Moscow. It reflects distance, pressing domestic priorities, and a crowded global agenda shaped by economic instability, climate pressures, great power tension, and regional conflicts. Nevertheless, the political effect is significant. When a war becomes routine, neutrality carries fewer reputational costs. For Ukraine, this means that engagement with the Global South cannot rely solely on moral clarity or legal principle; it requires persistent diplomacy that continually explains why the consequences of territorial conquest in Europe extend far beyond the region.
Recognizing this gap during wartime requires strategic clarity. Long wars test not only military strength but also diplomatic stamina. Countries of the Global South may not provide military or financial assistance on the scale of Ukraine's European partners, yet their importance should not be underestimated. Their demographic weight, regional leadership, and voting power in multilateral institutions give them significant influence over how the war is discussed and understood globally. Engaging consistently with countries such as Indonesia, Brazil, and India matters because they shape regional agendas and broader coalitions across the developing world. Sustained diplomatic outreach to these states strengthens Ukraine's global position over the long term.
Different Political Grammars
One reason for the cautious stance in parts of the Global South lies in the language of diplomacy. Ukraine's international messaging has understandably focused on defending the rules-based order, democratic solidarity, and European security. These arguments resonate powerfully in Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and probably Washington. They are morally and legally sound.
However, in many societies shaped by decolonization, non-alignment, and development struggles, political discourse follows a different grammar. Historical memory in these regions is marked by colonial domination, Cold War intervention, and uneven global hierarchies. Foreign policy is often guided less by institutional alignment and more by sovereignty, autonomy, and economic stability. In some cases, cautious positioning reflects deliberate strategic hedging for autonomy, rather than simple misperception.
A Lesson from Jakarta
Indonesia offers a telling example. It is the largest country in Southeast Asia, a G20 member, and a leading voice in the Global South. Yet Ukraine's diplomatic presence there has lacked continuity. The Ukrainian embassy in Jakarta has been without a resident ambassador since February 2025. At a time when sustained engagement is essential, prolonged gaps in high-level representation send an unintended signal about priorities.
Diplomacy is not only about UN votes or official statements. It is about presence, relationships, and consistent engagement. In Indonesia, as in other parts of the Global South, political influence is built over time through universities, youth organizations, media networks, and civil society platforms. Without stable leadership and institutional depth, mostly coming from the Ukrainian representatives there, outreach remains episodic and perceived as a "one-off event".
Presence Over Statements
At the same time, Russia has invested in long-term narratives. Moscow regularly invokes historical ties dating back to Soviet-era cooperation with post-colonial states. In Indonesia, Russia emphasizes shared memories of Cold War solidarity, defense cooperation, and educational exchanges. Russian cultural outreach, media content, and scholarship programs target younger generations, shaping perceptions gradually rather than through headline diplomacy alone. This approach reflects a long-standing Russian understanding that influence in post-colonial societies is built through memory, education, and narrative continuity rather than short-term political or economic incentives.
This contrast is telling. Ukraine and many of its Western partners tend to concentrate on official positions, encouraging governments to take clearer public stances and to uphold international norms consistently. Russia, by comparison, invests patiently at the societal level. It reinforces narratives of historical closeness, expands cultural and educational programs, and targets younger generations through long-term outreach. Influence in these contexts is built less through statements and more through sustained presence and familiarity over time.
Recalibrating Ukraine's Global Message
Fortunately, there is still space for recalibration.
First, Ukraine can more deliberately connect its struggle to anti-imperial traditions that resonate across much of the Global South. Russia's aggression is a clear case of territorial conquest aimed at undermining borders, identity, and political agency. In many African and Asian states, sovereignty was achieved through difficult struggles against empire. Presenting Ukraine's resistance in that context speaks directly to historical experiences that remain politically powerful today. At the same time, messaging that frames the war primarily as a defense of "European civilization" may resonate strongly within Europe but can unintentionally create distance elsewhere, where audiences do not see themselves reflected in that narrative. A broader framing centered on sovereignty and resistance to domination travels more effectively across regions.
Second, diplomatic messaging should consistently address material consequences. For many governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, food security, fertilizer supply, energy volatility, and debt vulnerability are immediate political concerns. The disruption of Ukrainian grain exports affected markets far beyond Europe. Demonstrating how Ukraine's survival contributes to global food stability and economic predictability makes the war relevant to domestic priorities.
Third, durable relationships require long-term institutional presence. High-level visits and symbolic summits matter, but they cannot replace steady, on-the-ground engagement. Strong embassies with stable leadership, expanded academic exchanges, partnerships with local media, youth initiatives, and Track II dialogues in key regional hubs help build familiarity and trust over time. This is also an area where Ukraine's allies can play a constructive role. Partners such as the United Kingdom, the European Union, and EU member states like Poland often have deeper institutional networks and long-standing ties in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Coordinated outreach can help Ukraine access platforms, strengthen connections, and engage potential partners more effectively. Consistent presence, supported by coalition diplomacy, signals long-term commitment.
Fourth, outreach should recognize regional diversity. The Global South is not a single political bloc. In parts of Africa, sovereignty is often discussed in terms of protection from external intervention. In much of Asia, stability and economic growth dominate strategic thinking. In Latin America, resistance to great-power coercion carries particular weight. Tailored narratives demonstrate attentiveness without compromising principle.
Conclusion: Narrative as Strategic Terrain
None of this means distancing Ukraine from Europe or weakening the moral clarity of its cause. Ukraine's strongest asset remains the legitimacy of its struggle against unprovoked aggression. The objective is not to alter that substance, but to communicate it in ways that resonate across different political and historical contexts.
Recent experience in Indonesia illustrates how easily diplomatic engagement can be reframed in competitive information environments. A formal communication from the Ukrainian Embassy, intended to convey Ukraine's position, was publicly portrayed by the Russian ambassador as interference in Indonesian domestic affairs. Regardless of intent, such episodes create openings for counter-narratives and shift attention away from the central issue of Russian aggression. In countries where sovereignty is a deeply guarded principle, even well-intentioned pressure can be recast as external intrusion.
While Ukrainian victory in this war will continue to depend on military strength, economic resilience, and political unity, it will also depend on whether Ukraine can sustain trust and credibility far beyond its immediate partners. In many parts of the Global South, perceptions are shaped gradually, through long-term presence and careful engagement. Protecting Ukraine's narrative from distortion and ensuring that its struggle is understood on its own terms is no longer peripheral diplomacy. It is part of the war itself.

Can China find a market for its fifth-generation J-35 warplanes?
Analysts are uncertain how much demand there will be for the fighter in the face of competition from the US F-35 or cheaper alternatives
They said political and economic considerations apart from performance would weigh on potential buyers, and questioned how many countries would want to buy the Chinese plane.
The J-35A spent more than a decade under development by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation, a subsidiary of AVIC. It was officially delivered to the People’s Liberation Army last year, after featuring in a major military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.
China has been promoting the sale of the jets overseas, displaying models at various international defence exhibitions, including last year’s Paris and Dubai air shows.

Netanyahu and Israel are provoking the U.S. into attacking Iran — and the media continues to ignore it

As Donald Trump assembles an overwhelming U.S. military armada in the Middle East, the American media continues to avoid explaining that Israel has regularly tried to instigate the U.S. into a war against Iran for decades.
Reports barely mention Israel, and nowhere cite the country’s past record of sabotaging the Obama nuclear deal, which had ended any risk that Iran would get nuclear weapons. The mainstream is also not reminding its audience that Israel conducted a long sabotage campaign, which included provocative assassinations of Iranian military leaders and scientists, which was partly designed to provoke a war with America.
This is not a new phenomenon. The mainstream American media has consistently downplayed or ignored this dangerous truth. Mondoweiss has published articles about the Israel connection at least several dozen times (here’s one, from December 2023).
Here are several recent examples of the latest media malpractice. MS Now, the network that used to be called MSNBC and is regarded as the most progressive mainstream cable news network, ran a fairly long evening segment on February 18 about the rising danger of a U.S. attack. The two guests were respected: Rob Malley, the lead negotiator in that 2015 Obama-era nuclear deal, and Michelle Goldberg, an accomplished New York Times columnist. The network’s host was Jacob Soboroff, who has done excellent reporting on the deportation crisis in the U.S.
Israel was not mentioned one single time.
[In fairness, Soboroff did partially redeem himself the following evening, February 19. He hosted again, and one of his guests, too briefly, was Ben Rhodes, the former Obama foreign policy adviser and a perceptive critic of Trump’s Iran threats. But their five-minute segment barely mentioned the vital Israel connection.]
A February 18 New York Times report was also inadequate. It did say in the third paragraph that “Benjamin Netanyahu . . . has been pushing for action to weaken Iran’s ability to launch missiles at Israel.” But that’s basically it. The rest of the report was largely devoted to listing the U.S. military’s rising troop strength in the region and citing the types of air defense missiles that America is deploying, including (pointlessly) naming the additional “F-35, F-22 and F-16 fighter jets” that have arrived on the scene.
What about the Washington Post? Israel didn’t come onstage in its February 17 report until way down in paragraph 16: “Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said in a speech Sunday that Iran must be required to relinquish all its enriched uranium and be barred from enriching more in any deal negotiated with the United States.”
That sentence begs for historical context, but the Post forgot to provide it. Here’s what actually happened: in 2015, the Obama administration negotiated a landmark nuclear deal with Iran, which capped below weapons grade Tehran’s ability to enrich uranium and mandated independent inspectors to insure compliance. Netanyahu actually flew to Washington in March 2015 and addressed Congress, in an arrogant failed effort to persuade the Senate to block the deal.
In the event, Iran completely complied with the nuclear agreement. Netanyahu and Israel should have been happy; Iran was now prevented from ever becoming a nuclear power. But in May 2018, under vigorous prodding from the Israel lobby, Donald Trump tore up the deal. Even so, Iran patiently continued to observe it, until a year or so later.
But Netanyahu and Israel didn’t stop there. His aim all along has been to actually change the regime in Tehran, and he knew that to succeed he needed to provoke the U.S. into a war. So Israel carried out an ongoing clandestine sabotage campaign, including cyber warfare and assassinating Iranian scientists and military leaders both inside the country and in the region. Israel also surely encouraged the first Trump administration to carry out its provocative killing of the senior Iranian commander, Qasem Soleimani, in Syria in January 2020.
Netanyahu’s instigations failed. Iran did not take the bait.
It’s vital to recognize that what Netanyahu and his advisers have been plotting is truly evil on many levels. But what should enrage Americans of all political persuasions is that Israel’s government is surely hoping that Iran will retaliate against the 30,000 to 40,000 U.S. troops who are stationed at 13 military bases across the region, which would give Netanyahu the war that he has long wanted. He and his advisers are putting at risk the lives of American service members so that Israel can increase its dominance in the Mideast and continue strengthening its system of apartheid.
Over the next few days, we may see if they have finally succeeded.

ICC allows prosecution of ex-Philippines President Duterte to expand evidence list in crimes against humanity case
International Criminal Court Pre-Trial Chamber issued ruling just days before start of confirmation of charges hearing
ISTANBUL
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has granted requests from both former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and prosecutors to add new items to their evidence lists in the crimes against humanity case involving the detained ex-leader, local media reported on Saturday.
The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber issued the ruling on Friday, just days before the scheduled start of a confirmation of charges hearing, the Manila Times reported.
The judges approved the defense request to add 108 items to its evidence list as well as the prosecution's request to admit 14 additional items.
The confirmation hearing is set to begin on Monday.
Duterte's legal team, in its request, argued that the additional materials were "highly relevant" to the crimes against humanity case against the former president.
The defense warned that not permitting the evidence would cause "significant prejudice" to Duterte.
In its ruling, the chamber found "good cause" to grant both requests, citing "the limited extent of the requested additions, the nature of the material concerned and its relevance to the charges brought against the suspect, as well as the absence of objection from the parties."
The confirmation of charges hearing will determine whether there is sufficient evidence to send Duterte to trial for alleged crimes against humanity connected to his "war on drugs" campaign as mayor of Davao City and later as president.
Duterte, who served as Philippines president from 2016 to 2022, has been detained at the ICC detention facility at The Hague since last March.

BRUSSELS — Some 88 countries and regions, including the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, on Saturday endorsed an India-led declaration on artificial intelligence with little commitment to keep the technology safe.
While the countries in the declaration recognized “the importance of security in AI systems,” they failed to include any binding measures on how to keep the technology safe, limiting themselves mostly to voluntary or industry-led measures.
India gained support for its push to democratize the technology, with the declaration calling to enhance “the affordability of and acces to AI resources.”

US military airlifts small reactor as Trump pushes to quickly deploy nuclear power
US military airlifts small reactor as Trump pushes to quickly deploy nuclear power
HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah (AP) — The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is the U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.
The nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well as for use by the military.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country’s energy landscape.
A new emphasis on nuclear energy
President Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.
Skeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.
Wright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.
“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
The minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.
“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.
Microreactors would be for civilian and military use
Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation’s first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.
Recognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Microreactors, designed to be portable, can “accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.
The demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.
The reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.
Some safety concerns haven’t been addressed, experts say
Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon’s ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.
The flight “doesn’t answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.
The Trump administration “hasn’t made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.
Officials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed of, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.
The microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.
“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on fossil fuels and other polluting energy under the Biden administration, he said, “Now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”

Kyiv receives four generators from Paris City Hall, four more to arrive soon – Klitschko
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo arrived in Kyiv for the sixth time since the start of the full-scale war, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported.
"Today, Anne Hidalgo did not come empty-handed. Our French friends brought generators that Kyiv so badly needs amid the energy crisis. Four generators arrived today. We expect four more in the coming days, for a total of eight, each with a capacity of 112 kilowatts. On behalf of the Kyiv community, I thanked our partners for all the assistance and support provided. And I presented the mayor of Paris with Kyiv’s highest honor — the Sign of Honor," Klitschko wrote on Telegram on Saturday.
Paris and Kyiv signed a Friendship and Cooperation Agreement in April 2022, and since the start of the full-scale war the French capital’s city hall has been sending Kyiv various forms of humanitarian aid, including generators and other necessary equipment, he said.

Palestinian Christians defiant in Lent amid Israeli persecution

Palestinian Christians face widespread Israel restrictions in Lent but cling to hope
As Lent begins and Palestinian Christians mark a season of repentance and prayer in the run-up to Easter, many are doing so under the shadow of intensifying settler violence and deepening Israeli control across the occupied West Bank, with their journeys to church, access to holy sites, and even daily routines increasingly constrained.
"We are approaching Lent season with so much concern, anxiety, and fear over the future, we are beginning to seriously think if there will be one day no Christian presence in Palestine", Reverend Munther Isaac, one of the most prominent representatives of Palestinian Christians, told The New Arab.
Reverend Isaac spoke of a tightening regime of permits and checkpoints and limits on worshippers, saying that the Palestinian Christian community as a whole feels this most acutely during the holiest periods of the year.
While in the past it was common to organise walks from Bethlehem to Jerusalem on certain feasts, including on Palm Sunday, Isaac said that now "we live in a new reality in which Jerusalem is isolated from the rest of Palestinian towns, including the Christian towns".
"As a member of the clergy, I need a permit from the Israeli military to be able to go to Jerusalem. The majority of my congregation don't have that permit, and when we have permits, you still have to go through the checkpoint, and it's not guaranteed if you even will be allowed in".
Even inside his own community, the arbitrariness is palpable: when his church installed a new bishop in January, the bishop's mother was only allowed to enter Jerusalem at the last minute despite holding a permit.
"This is the first time in history that Bethlehem and Jerusalem are separated", he says, describing how a once-lived ritual geography has been broken up by walls and military control.
"It was common to organise for a walk from Bethlehem to Jerusalem on certain feasts", he recalls. "For example, on Palm Sunday, you pray in Bethlehem, then go for the march in Jerusalem. You pray in Ramallah, go to Jerusalem for Sabt an-Nour, the Saturday before Easter, in which we celebrate the light coming out from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and going all over, not just Historic Palestine, but beyond in the Middle East".
"In fact, if you talk to people in Jerusalem, they will tell you how they remember years ago when people from other neighbouring Arab countries would come from Lebanon and Syria to celebrate the feast".
Today, he says, "We live in a new reality in which Jerusalem is isolated from the rest of Palestinian towns, including the Christian towns", and those processions are no longer possible.
The restrictions reach their peak on the holiest days of the Christian calendar. On the Saturday before Easter, Reverend Isaac notes, "a church that can take up to 10,000 people, Israel limits the number of worshippers to 1,500".
He insists this policy is not about safety, as Israeli authorities claim, but control: "This is illegal. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is in East Jerusalem and they have no legal jurisdiction over East Jerusalem and the Old City; they are an occupying power".
Alongside physical limits come daily humiliations against members of the Palestinian Christian community, ranging from hateful graffiti daubed on church walls in Jerusalem to members of the clergy being spat on in the streets.
"What's happening here is clear. Israel wants to change the identity of Jerusalem into an exclusively Jewish city", he says.
For Isaac, there is also a deep psychological toll in being physically close to his faith's most sacred sites yet effectively barred from them, with Palestinians living a two-minute walk from churches unable to enter due to Israeli military restrictions.
He argues that Israeli authorities try to "paint an idea that they allow Christians and freedom of religion by inviting clergy and monks from outside to come and pray, while seriously restricting access of the local Christian community".
"Restrictions are the same against Christians and Muslims", he says, with Muslim worshippers likewise facing major restrictions on their ability to access the al-Aqsa Mosque Compound during the holy month of Ramadan.
An exodus of Palestinian Christians
Even in Bethlehem, where Reverend Munther Isaac is based, daily life is hemmed in by two main checkpoints - one to the north and one to the south - that are frequently closed, forcing residents into complete isolation.
"It's become common now to spend hours at the checkpoint", he says.
"The plan is clear. These checkpoints, we know too well, they are not there for security; they are there to make our lives harder and harder. They are there to control, to intimidate, to push us out... the laws are a means to serve the system, to serve the settler colonial movement".
The continuing restrictions and pressure, he says, are fuelling an exodus. "Increasingly, people are choosing to leave. They think of their future, the future of their children".
"The common thinking that we keep hearing as clergy, as someone who spent time with family, is we survived. We chose to stay, but we don't think our children will, and we will encourage our children to study abroad and not come back. And that's a pattern right now".
The Reverend says during Lent, churches are full of the few faithful left but reveal gaping absences: "You notice a pattern that we have so many elderly people who are committed in their faith, but their children or grandchildren are not there anymore. They have left the country. And that's the real existential threat right now that we are facing."
Settler violence fuelling demographic change
The rise in settler violence and settlement expansion, Reverend Munther Isaac says, is forcing families to leave their homes in fear of their safety.
The demographic shift in Bethlehem underscores the peril: "There is almost the same amount of Jewish settlers in the Bethlehem area as there are Palestinians".
"Everybody is affected by it", he says, referring to the acceleration of settlement expansion and intensity of the settler attacks.
In late January, Israeli settlers celebrated the building of a new illegal settlement known as Yatziv near the Palestinian Christian town of Beit Sahour in the Bethlehem area.
The increasingly expanding settler colonial project has the full backing of the Israeli government.
Israel's extremist Finance Minister and settler leader Bezalel Smotrich during the inauguration of the illegal town, claimed "We're going to be here forever. We will never establish a Palestinian state here".
"The fear is that there is no one to protect us", Reverend Isaac says. "They committed a genocide in Gaza, and the world did nothing. So now, what will stop them from ethnically cleansing these villages?"
He speaks of at least two families he knows in the Christian town of Taybeh, near Ramallah, who have chosen to leave because of settler attacks.
When settlers carried out an incursion into the town to burn their cars and paint threatening messages on their walls, Isaac says, the family made the difficult decision to move to the city because they feared risking the lives of their little children if they chose to stay.
"Annexation is a fact. Annexation is a reality. It's interesting to me that it's being discussed as a possibility, when, in fact, it's already happening".
He points to a growing number of Israeli government officials choosing to live in settlements as the project continues to expand through the building of universities and a system of roads connecting the settlements to Israel proper.
Yet amid this suffocation, Reverend Isaac sees Easter as a time of hope, renewal, and defiance.
"Easter is a season of renewed hope, because Easter in our Christian faith is about resurrection", he says.
"It's about the fact that tyranny and injustice did not have the final word, that the tomb is empty, even death did not have the final word."
Though "right now, it seems we live in a very, very dark Friday and Saturday, using the Christian metaphor", he insists that "we know too well: if we have faith that Sunday will come, and because we know that Sunday will come, our hope is in you to be more resilient."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has signed decrees implementing the National Security and Defense Council’s decision to impose sanctions on 225 captains of vessels of the Russian shadow fleet and entities serving the Russian military-industrial complex.
According to Ukrinform, the president’s press service reported this.

One of the decisions is aimed at combating the Russian shadow fleet: Sanctions have been imposed on 225 ship captains who export Russian petroleum products.
Among them are citizens of 11 countries, including Russia, India, and the Philippines.
Monitoring of the situation in the Black, Red, and Baltic Seas showed that these captains commanded ships of the Russian shadow fleet and transported oil in circumvention of sanctions imposed by the European Union, G7, and other states.
Most of these tankers, 188 of them, are already under sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
“We continue to convince our partners of the importance of individual sanctions against tanker captains. Systematic work aboard a sanctioned tanker is sufficient grounds for consequences. We must eliminate the incentive to work with Russian oil, because it directly finances the war,” emphasized Advisor – Commissioner of the President for Sanctions Policy Vladyslav Vlasiuk.
European Commission Urges Hungary To Respect €90B Ukraine Loan Deal
The second package of sanctions includes 46 Russian citizens, two Iranian citizens, and 44 Russian companies that serve the Russian military-industrial complex. Among them are those who supply, develop, manufacture, and repair equipment, electronic warfare systems, and spare parts for the Russian military-industrial complex. Their products are used in the production of ballistic and cruise missiles, combat and reconnaissance drones, small arms, and ammunition.
Two Iranian citizens are involved in supplying aircraft parts and components in circumvention of sanctions. This was done in the interests of the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Corporation, Russia’s partner in the development and production of Shahed drones, which is already under sanctions imposed by Ukraine, the US, Switzerland, and New Zealand.
Ukraine will share this information with its partners to ensure synchronization and will continue expanding sanctions against other people and companies that help Russia’s aggression.

France wins Olympic ski mountaineering mixed relay

Emily Harrop and Thibault Anselmet combined to win gold for France in the mixed relay event of Olympic ski mountaineering in Bormio on Saturday, February 21. Harrop and Anselmet clocked a winning time of 26 minutes and 57.44 seconds in the relay, consisting of two ascents plus a section on foot with skis attached to the backpack for each ascent and two descents.
The Swiss duo of Marianne Fatton and Jon Kistler claimed silver, 11.86 seconds behind, with Spain's Ana Alonso Rodriguez and Oriol Cardona Coll rounding out the podium.
Harrop, born in the French Alps to English parents, was in dominant form in her opening leg. A silver medallist in the individual sprint, Harrop built up a healthy lead over Switzerland's Fatton and Spain's Alonso Rodriguez, the sprint gold and bronze medallists respectively. Anselmet maintained that lead over Kistler and men's sprint champion Carona Coll.
Ski mountaineering is making its Olympic debut at the Milan-Cortina Games and while the "skimo" sprints offered a condensed version of the sport, the mixed relay proved to be a true lung-busting race.
Harrop's second tour around the course on the Stelvio piste saw her extend the lead over her female rivals to more than 27 seconds. There was drama as Alonso Rodriguez missed one of the transitions, overskiing the line, which resulted in a 3-second time penalty.
Kistler pushed Anselmet, cutting the Frenchman's advantage to 8 seconds at one stage. Anselmet pushed on, his smooth metronomic movements belying the intense physical effort required on the unrelenting course. And there was joy in his face as he skied down the final descent, poles clutched in one hand, his other fist raised in triumph as he came through the line.
Harrop was on hand to celebrate the gun-to-tape victory with her teammate, having added Olympic gold to their world mixed relay crowns won last year and in 2023.
Skimo was first introduced at the 2020 Youth Olympic Winter Games in Lausanne and its inclusion in these Games was approved by the International Olympic Committee a year later. Backcountry skiing is an ever-growing market in winter sports and the International Ski Mountaineering Federation (ISMF) found the perfect window in which to showcase its extreme sprint version and mixed relay event to a wider public.

‘Why Should We Give Up Our Land?’ A Donbas Native on Putin’s Fear – and Ukraine’s Red Line

Yehor Firsov is one of those rare individuals who, by the age of 37, has managed to become an active civic leader, serve as a Member of Parliament, hold a senior position within the State Environmental Inspectorate, and, in 2022, join the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Starting as an ordinary soldier, he rose to become deputy commander of a drone regiment, while helping to build one of the most effective unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) units in the military.
His native city of Donetsk has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Yet he remains certain that he will return home one day. He is equally convinced that, despite pressure from US President Donald Trump, Ukraine must under no circumstances relinquish Donbas – a move that, he argues, would have severe and irreversible consequences, particularly for the Ukrainian army.

Why?
In an exclusive interview with Kyiv Post, AFU officer and Donbas native Yehor Firsov explains his position.
You are from Donetsk, and in 2014 you were active in political and civic life. Why did you join the Armed Forces of Ukraine? What is your motivation?
In 2014, when the fighting began, I did not take part in combat. I was in parliament; I had just become the youngest Member of Parliament. At that time, that was my political front and, in a way, my justification for not being at the front – because I was serving in parliament.
ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 20, 2026
And in 2022, I no longer had that kind of internal excuse. I clearly felt that you cannot run away from war. In 2014, I believed that in one way or another I had avoided it. This time – no. So I made the decision to go to the front. I made that decision firmly, so I would not frighten myself with uncertainty.
I decided that I would go to Avdiivka, find a brigade stationed there, and mobilize into it. At that time, the 109th and 110th brigades were deployed there. I chose the 109th Brigade. That was my motivation.
You were a well-known civic activist even before 2014, openly pro-Ukrainian. You headed the Donetsk office of the opposition party UDAR during the Yanukovych era, right in the heart of the so-called ‘Donetsk clan.’ Tell us, what is Donbas for you? What does it mean to you?
For me, Donbas is a place that no longer exists as I remember it from my youth. Neither mentally nor architecturally does that Donbas exist anymore. Burned-out Avdiivka, completely destroyed; Pokrovsk as it was no longer exists; even Donetsk itself is not the same. If you look back, Donetsk used to lead in everything – the best hotels, the best stadium, the best parks, the best public transport. Everything was the best. That is no longer true.
If you look at Donetsk now, it resembles something like Transnistria.
But there have also been changes. For example, 20 years ago, hearing Ukrainian spoken in Donbas was unusual. Now, every second, third, or fourth person speaks Ukrainian.
Another important point: I believe that for Putin and for Russia, the most dangerous people were pro-Ukrainian residents of the East. No one ever doubted the patriotism of Lviv. Or even the patriotism of Kyiv. But people who said, “Donetsk is Ukraine,” who went to rallies, who were ready to take up arms for Ukraine – they were dangerous.
That is why starting in 2013 there were constant assassination attempts and murders of Ukrainian activists. The first to be killed was Dmytro Cherniavskyi, a representative of Svoboda. He was killed on Lenin Square in the city center in March 2014. Then Ukraine’s Hero Volodymyr Rybak was brutally tortured and murdered for trying to defend the Ukrainian flag in Horlivka.
There were many cases when a person could be killed simply for holding a pro-Ukrainian position. But even the threat of violent death did not make us give up or step aside.
People continued going to rallies where they were beaten, abused, pelted with paving stones. Nevertheless, we fought, and I believe that struggle left its mark. Later, many of those activists – lawyers, professionals from various fields, boys and girls from Donetsk – joined the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Let’s talk about the opposite camp. How many openly pro-Russian people were there in Donbas?
Specifically pro-Russian activists – there were actually very few of them. That is if we are talking about Donetsk. They were always on the margins. They carried out various provocations even before 2014. For example, in 2008 and 2010 they set up a tent, collected some signatures for a referendum – by the way, even back then.
But it was three or four activists. In private conversations, they themselves said, not even as a secret, that it was all, so to speak, for money. And they had no support at all. Absolutely none, among the population. Let’s recall Euro-2012: in Donetsk everything was in yellow-blue flags, constant singing in Ukrainian, the Ukrainian anthem, and so on.
Recently, I heard an interesting observation from a colleague from Donbas. The Russians financed separatist movements across the east and south of Ukraine for real separatist purposes. But everywhere the money was stolen – except in Donetsk region. There, the money actually went where it was intended.
So what was that?
It meant transporting people directly from Russian territory, illegally across the border. It meant organizing coordinated actions. It meant financing headquarters and real operational work.
And even in 2014, in March, even in February, one story caught my eye where I did not recognize my Donetsk. It was a rally near the regional administration building. There were about 500 people, but they were very aggressive. The first thing that struck me was that I did not know a single person from that rally. There was not a single neighbor, classmate, or activist. We all knew each other there. The second point – there was a certain accent, not ours, typical for Donbas, but a Russian accent.
The third point. We noticed several people who had Russian passports; they were discussing something organizationally, some lists for money, and so on.
talk about the Armed Forces. You joined a brigade, and over time you became a specialist in UAVs and one of the early adopters of their active use. How did that happen?
It happened very simply. I was in the Territorial Defense Forces, I was in the infantry, and in the infantry, I went through several intense battles in Bakhmut; at that time, our 104th Battalion was in Bakhmut.
I experienced mortar shelling. I saw infantry assaults. That pushed me to the realization that either I needed to move into something more innovative – or sooner or later I would simply die, perhaps even from a random mortar shell.
So we started thinking about what creative solution we could implement.
That is how we began moving toward unmanned systems. Then I saw how the Special Operations Forces were using FPV drones – among the very first to do so. I picked up one of those drones and thought: “Eureka.”
I clearly understood that the future was in this technology. What I did not yet understand were the enormous challenges ahead. In 2023, we still did not know many things – what explosives to attach, how to configure them, how to program the drone, how to make it fly 10-20 kilometers (6.2-12.4 miles). We had to work very hard to figure it all out. But I was 100% certain that we had to innovate.
A group of unmanned systems operators was formed from guys from Pokrovsk. We called it “Muramasa.” I had the honor of leading it and remain its informal leader. At one point in 2024 and partly in 2025, Muramasa was the most effective unit in the Armed Forces in terms of equipment destruction.
During a single deployment, we could destroy about 40 units of equipment. Our statistics were such that some battalions and regiments could not understand how we operated on that scale. And from there, things accelerated.
Later, we were offered a transfer to the Third Assault Brigade. We agreed. Muramasa moved into an experimental direction. To fly effectively and at long distances, you have to experiment.
I became an officer and took on the role of deputy regiment commander. Now I am responsible for two areas. First, finding the best technology – drones that you can, ideally, take out of the box and fly, while being both the cheapest and the most effective. Second, securing funding for that technology.
Tell us what your goal was during active operations against the enemy.
We targeted enemy logistics and struck everything moving 30-40 kilometers behind their lines. We destroyed large amounts of equipment – many Ural trucks carrying personnel or ammunition, MT-LB armored vehicles towing equipment.
Those were slightly different times, including technologically, because earlier flying 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) was something from the realm of the incredible. Now it is a working distance and you do not surprise anyone with 30 kilometers. Before that, even such concepts as a kill zone, the length of a kill zone, did not exist.
You try to avoid politics, but you are from Donbas. Ukraine is being pressured to give up Donbas, allegedly in exchange for peace. Do you have something to say about that?
I do. And the first thing that surprises me – and I do not understand it – is when you have to explain something obvious. What kind of discourse is this that we have to give something up? Seriously? You have to give up what is yours, and the only internal question you have is – why the hell should you do that? Simply, why the hell should you give it up?
Let someone give at least one argument. There is not a single argument. There is no guarantee that after giving up Donbas, they will not take something from us in another region. Not to mention that Donbas is more or less prepared for defense in terms of a huge number of strongholds, defensive structures, terrain, large plants, and factories where defense can be held.
And beyond Donbas there is steppe, where you are pushed out into an open field, where it is very difficult to defend. There are certain advantages in the fact that in Donbas, there are still large structures from Soviet times – concrete plants, factories that no longer operate, but you can organize defense, logistics, warehouses, headquarters there, keep personnel – and all of this will be safe.
The Russians understand that they do not have enough missiles, Shaheds, and everything else to bomb that part of Donbas that remains. These are huge industrial cities with factories, mines, plants, where simply finding some, conditionally speaking, concrete building is not a difficult task.
But I do not want to talk about these arguments, I just want to ask: why the hell should we give up Donbas? Why the hell should we give up our territory? Which we have been defending for quite a long time. That is all.
Do you believe that you will someday return to your native Donetsk?
I do.
Returning to Donbas is not far – a few hours from Kyiv, one and a half to two from Kharkiv. And Donetsk – yes, I believe we will return. You may not believe it, but even recently I was talking with someone about this. I truly believe we will go back.
Even if today that belief takes your breath away – I still believe it

Labour minister faces calls to be sacked over false claims against journalists

22:38:25 KST

Politicians from across the spectrum have said a minister should be sacked after a Guardian report that he had accused journalists of having links to Russian intelligence.
Their comments came after an investigation showed that Josh Simons, who was running Labour Together at the time, had falsely concluded the journalists had obtained information about the thinktank from a Russian hack.
The revelation has added to the pressure on Simons, a Cabinet Office minister, who is already the subject of a departmental ethics inquiry, and prompted calls from several politicians that he should be sacked or resign.
Kevin Hollinrake, the chair of the Conservative party, said Simons should be suspended from office and an independent inquiry should be carried out, adding: “The Cabinet Office cannot be left to mark its own homework.”
Hollinrake said the need to act was acute because Simons, in his role as a junior minister, had a “ministerial responsibility for inquiries and whistleblowing across government” at a time when questions were being raised about his conduct.
The Labour backbencher Jon Trickett said Simons should be dismissed by Keir Starmer. “This reprehensible behaviour is reminiscent of the dirty tricks that were used by Richard Nixon’s White House during the Watergate scandal. It represents serious misconduct.”
Lisa Smart, the Liberal Democrats’ Cabinet Office spokesperson, said Simons should consider his position. “We were told this government would be cleaner than clean,” she said. “Instead, we’re stuck with cabinet ministers whose previous spin tactics literally involved reporting journalists to the intelligence agencies.”
Emails written in January and February 2024 by Simons and a subordinate to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a unit of GCHQ, show that he pressed officials to investigate journalists. He told officials that one journalist was “living with” the daughter of a former adviser to Jeremy Corbyn. He claimed that the former adviser was “suspected of links to Russian intelligence”.
Simons was hoping the security agency would investigate the sourcing behind a story in the Sunday Times about Labour Together’s failure to disclose political donations. But despite the accusations, the information was not obtained via a hack and the evidence of Russian involvement nonexistent.
One person named in Labour Together’s emails to the NCSC accused the minister of orchestrating a “McCarthyite smear” campaign, while a second said the false accusation was “disturbing, creepy and deplorable”.
Earlier this month, it emerged that Simons had commissioned Apco, an American public affairs agency, to investigate two Sunday Times journalists and the sources of a story critical of Labour Together that was published in 2023.
The story had revealed fresh details about £730,000 of undeclared donations to Labour Together, run at that time by Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s erstwhile chief adviser. The Electoral Commission had fined the thinktank more than £14,000 for failing to declare the donations.
After Apco completed its report, Simons concluded the information came from a hack of the Electoral Commission, and told the NCSC early in 2024 that “our evidence” showed it had been “disseminated to people known to be operating in a pro-Kremlin propaganda network with links to Russian intelligence”.
At Simons’ direction, his chief of staff at Labour Together told the security officials that because the information “was disseminated to pro-Russian journalists linked to other ‘hack and leak’ operations, we believe that the likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state”.
However, Paul Holden, a freelance journalist who provided the Sunday Times with documents for their original report, recently showed the Guardian his source materials. They indicate the story was based on files leaked from the Labour party by whistleblowers.
Meanwhile, at the time of Simons’ correspondence with the NCSC, the cybersecurity agency had already concluded there had been a hack of the Electoral Commission, but that it had been conducted by China. Also, the information stolen consisted of electoral records, not of the watchdog’s correspondence on regulatory matters.
A spokesperson for Josh Simons said: “Labour Together commissioned Apco to investigate the information Paul Holden obtained for his book, as has repeatedly been made clear.”

Hong Kong police probe death of man, 66, in fall from bamboo scaffolding
Force says detectives from its Mong Kok district criminal investigation team have taken over case
Hong Kong police are investigating the death of a 66-year-old man who fell from bamboo scaffolding, with drugs discovered in the flat he climbed out of.
The force said the man, surnamed Yip, was found unconscious on a platform at 3 Nelson Street in Mong Kok at 2.38pm on Saturday. He was rushed to Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei but was subsequently declared dead.
Police said detectives from its Mong Kok district criminal investigation team had taken over the case and were looking into the circumstances behind the fall.
Preliminary investigations showed that the man climbed onto the scaffolding from a flat in the building before losing his footing and falling.
Officers subsequently found about 90 suspected midazolam tablets, a type of tranquiliser, and tools for drug consumption in the flat. The seized substances have an estimated market value of about HK$1,200 (US$153).
Following initial investigations, the case has been classified as a fall from height. No arrests have been made in connection with the incident so far.

Six races, six golds - Klaebo's historic Olympics
- Published
Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, Norway's king of cross-country skiing, broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics with his sixth of the Games.
Klaebo led a Norwegian sweep of the podium in the 50km mass start classic, with team-mates Martin Loewstroem Nyenget and Emil Iversen taking silver and bronze respectively.
The 29-year-old finished the brutal distance in two hours six minutes 44.8 seconds, 8.9secs ahead of Nyenget who takes his third medal of the Games.
"It's been crazy, it's a dream come true," Klaebo told BBC Sport.
"I really think this Olympics has been perfect. Being able to crown the Olympics with the 50km was unbelievable."
Klaebo breaks the previous record of five golds from a single Games, held by American speed skater Eric Heiden since the Lake Placid Olympics of 1980.
It also extends his own record for most Winter Olympic golds to 11, while he becomes the first athlete to win all six cross-country events at one Games.
Only US swimming great Michael Phelps, who won 23 gold medals, has more Olympic titles to his name.
Born in Oslo, Klaebo moved to Trondheim - a haven of cross-country skiing trails - as a young child, a move that has seen him become the greatest to ever do the sport.
No other man, active or retired, comes close to his record of 116 World Cup wins, while he is also a 15-time world champion, winning all six titles at last year's edition on home snow in Trondheim.
"After the world championships last year, we knew that it was possible, but to be able to do it, it's hard to find the right words," he told reporters.
"[There were] so many emotions when I'm crossing the finish line."
His sixth Olympic gold at Milan-Cortina adds to the titles he had won earlier in the Games in the skiathlon, sprint classic, 10km interval start free, 4x7.5km relay and the team sprint.
Musgrave 'still young and promising' at fifth Olympics
Elsewhere in the race, Team GB's Andrew Musgrave placed sixth, almost four minutes behind Klaebo's winning time, while team-mate Joe Davies was 16th.
Musgrave, 35, is appearing at his fifth Olympics - but did not rule out a sixth in four years' time.
"I'm still young and promising," Musgrave joked to BBC Sport.
"It was a decent Games. I came in good shape, but not quite good enough to fight the Norwegians, they're just so dominant at the moment."
It marks the end of a remarkable Olympics for Great Britain's cross-country team, in which Musgrave and James Clugnet recorded a fifth-place finish in the team sprint event, the nation's best Olympic result in the sport.
That bettered Musgrave's sixth in the 10km interval start freestyle, while Anna Pryce recorded a best British women's result at an Olympics with her 32nd place in the sprint classic.
"We've had the best ever women's Olympic result, best ever men's Olympic result, best ever team result.
"Joe is still young and up and coming, he's doing super good, fighting for top 10s, so the whole team is just showing that we work well together, we've got a good programme.
"We've had limited resources but we can still show that we can do good results."

URCS warming centers continue to operate
The Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) reports on the support for the continuous operation of the deployed warming centers.
"Ukrainian Red Cross Society warming centers remain a place of support for people. Here, one can warm up, have a hot cup of tea or coffee, receive a hot meal, charge a phone, rest and socialize," the Ukrainian Red Cross Society said on Facebook.
This week, Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger and International Committee of the Red Cross Director General Pierre Krähenbühl visited Ukrainian Red Cross Society warming centers in Kyiv during separate working visits to Ukraine.
Ukrainian Red Cross Society Director General Maksym Dotsenko said he briefed the Austrian foreign minister on how the organization is responding to the consequences of attacks on energy infrastructure.
"We had a substantive conversation about the humanitarian situation in the country, the needs of people and the challenges our team faces every day under conditions of full-scale war ... We also discussed the work of rapid response teams that assist those affected by shelling and work alongside the State Emergency Service of Ukraine," Dotsenko said.
During his visit to a warming center, the ICRC director general spoke with residents of the capital. Krähenbühl and Dotsenko discussed humanitarian assistance and further cooperation.
"The support of international partners is extremely important for ensuring continuous humanitarian assistance and strengthening the Ukrainian Red Cross Society's capacity to respond swiftly to the needs of people across the country," the organization said.

Fico threatens to halt electricity supplies to Ukraine starting Monday
TVP World reported this, as cited by Ukrinform.
Earlier on Thursday, Slovakia announced it was suspending diesel fuel deliveries to Ukraine due to disruptions in the supply of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline.
Fico has now threatened to appeal to Slovak companies to stop supplying electricity to Ukraine if the operation of the Druzhba pipeline was not restored.
“If on Monday, February 23, the Ukrainian president does not resume deliveries, I will ask Slovak companies to halt emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine on the same day,” Polish Radio quoted Fico as saying in a statement published on social media.
He added that in January alone, Slovakia supplied Ukraine with twice as much electricity as it did in all of 2025.
Slovakia declared a state of emergency in the oil sector on Wednesday, as it was forced to draw on its reserves.
As Ukrinform previously reported, on January 27, Russian forces struck energy infrastructure in the Lviv region. It later emerged that a drone may have hit a section of the pipeline used to transport Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia. Naftogaz confirmed the strike but did not specify what exactly was hit, noting only that it was the company’s 15th attack in a single month.
Subsequently, Bratislava and Budapest accused Ukraine of delaying repairs to the pipeline. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha reminded Hungary that the problems with Russian oil transit were caused by Russia’s aggression and its strikes on the Druzhba pipeline infrastructure – attacks to which Budapest has not publicly responded.
At the same time, former Slovak Economy Minister Karel Hirman, who is also an expert in the oil and gas sector, stated that Robert Fico’s government did not have the authority to ban electricity exports to Ukraine despite the threats.
It also became known that Hungary was considering the possibility of halting electricity and gas exports to Ukraine if Kyiv did not resume the transit of Russian oil to the country via the Druzhba pipeline.

India, Brazil sign rare earths deal to build ‘resilient supply chains’
With China holding a near-monopoly on rare earths production, India and other countries are seeking alternative sources
“The agreement on critical minerals and rare earths is a major step towards building resilient supply chains,” Modi said.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of critical minerals, which are used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smartphones to jet engines and guided missiles.
India, seeking to cut its dependence on top exporter China, has been expanding domestic production and recycling while scouting for new suppliers.
“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energies and critical minerals is at the core of the pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Lula said.
The details of the deal were not immediately available.

At least 50 people were killed and several women and children abducted in an attack on a village in Nigeria's northwestern Zamfara State.
The assault, carried out by terrorists locally referred to as bandits, began Thursday night and continued into Friday morning, with attackers on motorcycles setting fire to buildings and shooting residents of the village of Tungan Dutse, who tried to flee Hamisu Faru, a state lawmaker, confirmed the incident to Anadolu on Saturday.
“No one slept since Thursday and this morning. Some people lost three family members,” Faru told Anadolu.
The victims' bodies have been prepared for a mass burial, with corpses robed in white on Saturday. The number of abductees remains unclear, as local officials continue to account for the missing.
Violence displaces thousands
Nigeria's security situation is quite dire, especially in the country’s northwest, where Zamfara is located.
The area has been plagued by bandit attacks, kidnappings, and killings, with thousands displaced and many more vulnerable.
The Nigerian government has taken some steps to address the issue, including deploying troops and collaborating with international partners like the US for technical support and intelligence sharing.
However, the situation remains challenging, with overlapping security threats from armed criminal gangs and rebel militants.

Emily Harrop and Thibault Anselmet combined to win gold for France in the mixed relay event of Olympic ski mountaineering in Bormio on Saturday.
Harrop and Anselmet clocked a winning time of 26min 57.44sec in the relay, consisting of two ascents plus a section on foot with skis attached to the backpack for each ascent and two descents.
The Swiss duo of Marianne Fatton and Jon Kistler claimed silver, 11.86sec behind, with Spain's Ana Alonso Rodriguez and Oriol Cardona Coll rounding out the podium.
Harrop, born in the French Alps to English parents, was in dominant form in her opening leg.
A silver medallist in the individual sprint, Harrop built up a healthy lead over Switzerland's Fatton and Spain's Alonso Rodriguez, the sprint gold and bronze medallists respectively.
Anselmet maintained that lead over Kistler and men's sprint champion Carona Coll.
Ski mountaineering is making its Olympic debut at the Milan-Cortina Games and while the 'skimo' sprints offered a condensed version of the sport, the mixed relay proved to be a true lung-busting race.
Harrop's second tour around the course on the Stelvio piste saw her extend the lead over her female rivals to more than 27sec.
There was drama as Alonso Rodriguez missed one of the transitions, overskiing the line, which resulted in a 3sec time penalty.

Kistler pushed Anselmet, cutting the Frenchman's advantage to 8sec at one stage.
Anselmet pushed on, his smooth metronomic movements belying the intense physical effort required on the unrelenting course.
And there was joy in his face as he skied down the final descent, poles clutched in one hand, his other fist raised in triumph as he came through the line.

Turkish Red Crescent aid continues to flow into Gaza after reopening of Rafah crossing
Turkish Red Crescent's 21st Goodness Ship reaches El Arish, Egypt with humanitarian aid for Gaza, after departing from Türkiye
ANKARA
The 21st Goodness Ship loaded with humanitarian aid from the Turkish Red Crescent destined for Gaza reached El Arish in northeastern Egypt on Saturday after departing from Mersin, Türkiye.
Turkish aid continues to flow into Gaza following the partial reopening of the Rafah border crossing earlier this month after nearly two years of closure, enabling increased humanitarian deliveries amid the ongoing ceasefire.
The latest ship carries some 3,300 tons of humanitarian aid, including 175,000 food parcels along with food items, personal care products, clothing, shelter materials, water, and other essential living supplies.
Upon arrival at El Arish, the aid materials were received and will be transferred to Gaza via the Rafah border crossing in coordination with the Egyptian Red Crescent.
Since Oct. 7, 2023, the Turkish Red Crescent has delivered humanitarian aid to Gaza through the Goodness Ship initiative.
The aid group is strengthening its solidarity network through collaborations with public institutions and the private sector.
Türkiye has ramped up efforts to send containers to the region, particularly following the reopening of the Rafah Border Crossing on Feb. 2 after a two-year closure, with plans to dispatch an initial 20,000 containers to Gaza.

ICE begins to purchase warehouses, but some owners are backing out of deals

ICE has been quietly scooping up mega warehouses to turn into detention centers
Deeds show that ICE has acquired at least seven warehouses across Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Texas
- Bookmark
In a quiet Texas town on the edge of the Rio Grande, whispers began to circulate about federal immigration officials eyeing three colossal warehouses for conversion into a detention center.
Before local authorities could even ascertain the truth, a deed was filed, revealing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had already sealed a $97.5 million deal for the 826,000-square-foot properties in Socorro, a community of 40,000 just outside El Paso.
Rudy Cruz Jr., the mayor of the predominantly Hispanic town, expressed his dismay, "Nobody from the federal government bothered to pick up the phone or even send us any type of correspondence letting us know what’s about to take place."
Socorro, characterized by low-slung ranch homes and trailer parks, where orchards meet strip malls, is now among at least 20 communities nationwide targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) $35.6 billion expansion of detention facilities.
As public support for the agency and the administration’s immigration crackdown wanes, communities are increasingly vocal in their opposition to mass detentions. Concerns range from potential strain on water supplies and local services to a reduction in tax revenue. Often, local leaders, including mayors, commissioners, governors, and even Members of Congress, have only learned of ICE’s plans after properties were purchased or leased, sparking frustration even in areas that had previously supported the administration.
"I just feel," Mayor Cruz, whose wife was born in Mexico, stated, "that they do these things in silence so that they don’t get opposition."
Deeds show that ICE, a division of DHS, has acquired at least seven warehouses across Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Texas. While other deals have been announced, some have yet to be finalised, with eight sales scuttled due to local opposition. DHS has pushed back against the term "warehouses," asserting in a statement that they would be "very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards."
The process has been fraught with missteps. ICE recently admitted to a "mistake" in announcing warehouse purchases in Chester, New York, and Roxbury, New Jersey, with the latter sale subsequently closing. DHS has confirmed its search for more detention space but has refrained from disclosing individual sites before acquisitions. Some cities have been alerted to ICE’s scouting activities by reporters, while others received tips from an online spreadsheet circulated by activists.
The full scope of the project was only confirmed on February 13, when New Hampshire’s governor’s office, facing backlash over a planned 500-bed processing centre, released an ICE document. It revealed the agency’s intention to spend $30.2 billion to boost detention capacity to 92,000 beds. Since the administration took office, the number of people detained by ICE has surged from 40,000 to 75,000 across more than 225 sites.
The document outlines plans for eight large-scale detention centres, each capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 detainees, alongside 16 smaller regional processing centers and the acquisition of 10 existing "turnkey" facilities. This expansion is funded through a significant tax and spending cuts bill passed by Congress last year, which nearly doubled DHS’s budget. The administration is utilising military contracts to construct these centres, a method that allows for considerable secrecy and rapid action, bypassing standard processes and safeguards, according to Charles Tiefer, a professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School.
In Socorro, the sheer scale of the ICE-owned warehouses – large enough to accommodate four and a half Walmart Supercenters – stands in stark contrast to the town’s Spanish colonial architecture. At a recent City Council meeting, public comments stretched for hours. Jorge Mendoza, an El Paso County retiree whose grandparents immigrated from Mexico, remarked, "I think a lot of innocent people are getting caught up in their dragnet." Many speakers also voiced concerns about three recent deaths at an ICE detention facility at the nearby Fort Bliss Army base.
Even communities that had previously supported the administration have been blindsided. In rural Berks County, Pennsylvania, Commissioner Christian Leinbach discovered ICE’s £69.2 million purchase of a warehouse only after a local land records official informed him. "There was absolutely no warning," Leinbach said, highlighting the loss of over £630,000 in local tax revenue, despite ICE’s claims about income taxes paid by its workers.
In Social Circle, Georgia, a town of just 5,000, officials were stunned by plans for a facility that could hold 7,500 to 10,000 people. They learned of the £101.5 million warehouse sale through a reporter, only hearing from DHS after the deal was complete. Like Socorro and Berks County, Social Circle questioned whether its water and sewage systems could cope. While ICE claims due diligence, Social Circle stated the agency’s analysis relied on a yet-to-be-built sewer treatment plant. "To be clear, the City has repeatedly communicated that it does not have the capacity or resources to accommodate this demand," the city declared.
Similarly, in Surprise, Arizona, officials sent a scathing letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after ICE acquired a massive warehouse in a residential area near a high school without warning. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, has even raised the prospect of legal action to declare the site a public nuisance.
Back in Socorro, residents queued to speak against the ICE facility, spilling out of the City Council chambers. Eduardo Castillo, a former attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, advised city officials that challenging the federal government, while intimidating, is "not impossible." He warned, "If you don’t at least try, you will end up with another inhumane detention facility built in your jurisdiction and under your watch."

ICE is quietly buying warehouses for detention centers and leaving local officials out of the loop
At least 20 communities with large warehouses across the U.S. have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s $45-billion expansion of detention centers
- Bookmark
In a Texas town at the edge of the Rio Grande and a tall metal border wall, rumors swirled that federal immigration officials wanted to purchase three hulking warehouses to transform into a detention center.
As local officials scrambled to find out what was happening, a deed was filed showing the Department of Homeland Security had already inked a $122.8 million deal for the 826,000-square-foot (76,738-square-meter) warehouses in Socorro, a bedroom community of 40,000 people outside El Paso.
“Nobody from the federal government bothered to pick up the phone or even send us any type of correspondence letting us know what’s about to take place,” said Rudy Cruz Jr., the mayor of the predominantly Hispanic town of low-slung ranch homes and trailer parks, where orchards and irrigation ditches share the landscape with strip malls, truck stops, recycling plants and distribution warehouses.
Socorro is among at least 20 communities with large warehouses across the U.S. that have become stealth targets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s $45-billion expansion of detention centers.
As public support for the agency and President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown sags, communities are objecting to mass detentions and raising concerns that the facilities could strain water supplies and other services while reducing local tax revenue. In many cases, mayors, county commissioners, governors and members of Congress learned about ICE’s ambitions only after the agency bought or leased space for detainees, leading to shock and frustration even in areas that have backed Trump.
“I just feel,” said Cruz, whose wife was born in Mexico, “that they do these things in silence so that they don’t get opposition.”
Communities scramble for information
ICE, which is part of DHS, has purchased at least seven warehouses in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas, signed deeds show. Other deals have been announced but not yet finalized, though buyers scuttled sales in eight locations.
DHS objected to calling the sites warehouses, stressing in a statement that they would be “very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”
The process has been chaotic at times. ICE this past week acknowledged it made a “mistake” when it announced warehouse purchases in Chester, New York, and Roxbury, New Jersey. Roxbury then announced Friday that the sale there had closed.
DHS has confirmed it is looking for more detention space but hasn’t disclosed individual sites ahead of acquisitions. Some cities learned that ICE was scouting warehouses through reporters. Others were tipped off by a spreadsheet circulating online among activists whose source is unclear.
It wasn’t until Feb. 13 that the scope of the warehouse project was confirmed, when the governor’s office in New Hampshire, where there is backlash to a planned 500-bed processing center, released a document from ICE showing the agency plans to spend $38.3 billion to boost detention capacity to 92,000 beds.
Since Trump took office, the number of people detained by ICE has increased to 75,000 from 40,000, spread across more than 225 sites.
ICE could use the warehouses to consolidate and to increase capacity. The document describes a project that includes eight large-scale detention centers, capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 detainees each, and 16 smaller regional processing centers. The document also refers to the acquisition of 10 existing “turnkey” facilities.
The project is funded through the big tax and spending cuts bill passed by Congress last year that nearly doubled DHS' budget. To build the detention centers, the Trump administration is using military contracts.
Those contracts allow a lot of secrecy and for DHS to move quickly without following the usual processes and safeguards, said Charles Tiefer, a professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School.
Socorro facility could be among the largest
In Socorro, the ICE-owned warehouses are so large that 4 1/2 Walmart Supercenters could fit inside, standing in contrast to the remnants of the austere Spanish colonial and mission architecture that defines the town.
At a recent City Council meeting, public comments stretched for hours. “I think a lot of innocent people are getting caught up in their dragnet,” said Jorge Mendoza, an El Paso County retiree whose grandparents immigrated from Mexico.
Many speakers invoked concerns about three recent deaths at an ICE detention facility at the nearby Fort Bliss Army base.
Communities fear a financial hit
Even communities that backed Trump in 2024 have been caught off guard by ICE's plans and have raised concerns.
In rural Pennsylvania's Berks County, commissioner Christian Leinbach called the district attorney, the sheriff, the jail warden and the county’s head of emergency services when he first heard ICE might buy a warehouse in Upper Bern Township, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from his home.
No one knew anything.
A few days later, a local official in charge of land records informed him that ICE had bought the building — promoted by developers as a “state-of-the art logistics center” — for $87.4 million.
“There was absolutely no warning,” Leinbach said during a meeting in which he raised concerns that turning the warehouse into a federal facility means a loss of more than $800,000 in local tax dollars.
ICE has touted the income taxes its workers would pay, though the facilities themselves will be exempt from property taxes.
A Georgia detention center could house twice the population of the city where it's located
In Social Circle, Georgia, which also strongly supported Trump in 2024, officials were stunned by ICE’s plans for a facility that could hold 7,500 to 10,000 people after first learning about it through a reporter.
The city, which has a population of just 5,000 and worries about the infrastructure needs for such a detention center, only heard from DHS after the $128.6 million sale of a 1 million-square-foot (92,900-square-meter) warehouse was completed. Like Socorro and Berks County, Social Circle questioned whether the water and sewage system could keep up.
ICE has said it did due diligence to ensure the sites don’t overwhelm city utilities. But Social Circle said the agency's analysis relied on a yet-to-be built sewer treatment plant.
“To be clear, the City has repeatedly communicated that it does not have the capacity or resources to accommodate this demand, and no proposal presented to date has demonstrated otherwise,” the city said in a statement.
And in the Phoenix suburb of Surprise, officials sent a scathing letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after ICE without warning bought a massive warehouse in a residential area about a mile from a high school. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, raised the prospect of going to court to have the site declared a public nuisance.
Crowds wait to speak in Socorro
Back in Socorro, people waiting to speak against the ICE facility spilled out of the City Council chambers, some standing beside murals paying tribute to the World War II-era Braceros Program that allowed Mexican farmworkers to be guest workers in the U.S. The program stoked Socorro’s economy and population before President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration in the 1950s began mass deportations aimed at people who had crossed the border illegally.
Eduardo Castillo, formerly an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, told city officials it is intimidating but “not impossible” to challenge the federal government.
“If you don’t at least try,” he said, “you will end up with another inhumane detention facility built in your jurisdiction and under your watch.”

New Mexico launches investigation of forced sterilization of Native American women
In the 1970s, the agency that provides health care to Native Americans sterilized thousands of women without their full and informed consent
- Bookmark
In the 1970s, the U.S. agency that provides health care to Native Americans sterilized thousands of women without their full and informed consent, depriving them of the opportunity to start or grow families.
Decades later, the state of New Mexico is set to investigate that troubling history and its lasting harm.
New Mexico legislators approved a measure this week to have the state Indian Affairs Department and the Commission on the Status of Women examine the history, scope and continuing impact of forced and coerced sterilizations of women of color by the Indian Health Service and other providers. The findings are expected to be reported to the governor by the end of 2027.
“It’s important for New Mexico to understand the atrocities that took place within the borders of our state,” said state Sen. Linda Lopez, one of the legislation’s sponsors.
It's not the first state to confront its past. In 2023, Vermont launched a truth and reconciliation commission to study forced sterilization of marginalized groups including Native Americans. In 2024, California began paying reparations to people who had been sterilized without their consent in state-run prisons and hospitals.
The New Mexico Legislature also laid the groundwork to create a separate healing commission and for a formal acknowledgment of a little known piece of history that haunts Native families
Sarah Deer, a professor at the University of Kansas School of Law, said it's long overdue.
“The women in these communities carry these stories,” she said.
Outside of a 1976 U.S. Government Accountability Office report, the federal government has never acknowledged what Deer calls a campaign of “systemic” sterilizations in Native American communities.
The Indian Health Service and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to multiple emails requesting comment on New Mexico's investigation.
A troubling history
In 1972, Jean Whitehorse was admitted to an Indian Health Service hospital in Gallup, New Mexico, with a ruptured appendix. Just 22 and a new mother, Whitehorse said she remembers experiencing “extreme pain” as providers presented her with a flurry of consent forms before rushing her into emergency surgery.
“The nurse held the pen in my hand. I just signed on the line,” said Whitehorse, a Navajo Nation citizen.
A few years later when she was struggling to conceive a second child, Whitehorse said she returned to the hospital and learned she had received a tubal ligation. The news devastated Whitehorse, contributed to the breakdown of her relationship and sent her spiraling into alcoholism, she said.
Advocates already were sounding the alarm about women like Whitehorse who were entering IHS clinics and hospitals to give birth or for other procedures and later finding themselves unable to conceive. The activist group Women of All Red Nations, or WARN — an offshoot of the American Indian Movement — was formed in part to expose the practice.
In 1974, Choctaw and Cherokee physician Connie Redbird Uri reviewed IHS records and alleged that the federal agency had sterilized as many as 25% of its female patients of childbearing age. Some of the women Uri interviewed were unaware they had been sterilized. Others said they were bullied into consenting or misled to believe the procedure was reversible.
Uri’s allegations helped prompt the GAO audit, which found that the Indian Health Service sterilized 3,406 women in four of the agency's 12 service areas between 1973 and 1976, including in Albuquerque. The agency found that some patients were under the age of 21 and most had signed forms that didn't comply with federal regulations meant to ensure informed consent.
GAO researchers determined that interviewing women who had undergone sterilizations “would not be productive,” citing a single study of cardiac surgical patients in New York who struggled to recall past conversations with doctors. Because of the lack of patient interviews and the narrow purview of the GAO's audit, advocates say the full scope and impact remains unaccounted for.
A venue to tell their stories
Whitehorse didn't share her experience for nearly 40 years, she said. First, she told her daughter. Then, other family.
“Each time I tell my story, it relieves the shame, the guilt,” Whitehorse said. “Now I think, why should I be ashamed? It’s the government that should be ashamed of what they did to us.”
Whitehorse now advocates publicly for victims of forced sterilization. In 2025, she testified about the practice to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and called for the United States to formally apologize.
Whitehorse hopes New Mexico’s investigation will offer more victims a venue to tell their stories. But advocates like Rachael Lorenzo, executive director of the Albuquerque-based sexual and reproductive health organization Indigenous Women Rising, say the commission must be careful to avoid re-traumatizing survivors across generations.
“It’s such a taboo topic. There’s a lot of support that needs to happen when we tell these traumatic stories,” said Lorenzo.
In a New Mexico legislative hearing earlier this month, retired Indian Health Service physician Dr. Donald Clark testified that he has seen patients in their 20s and 30s “seeking contraception but not trusting that they will not be irreversibly sterilized” because of stories quietly passed down by their grandmothers, mothers and aunts.
“It’s still an issue that is affecting women’s choice of birth control today,” Clark said.
A pattern of disenfranchisement
A 1927 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Bell upheld states' rights to sterilize people it considered “unfit" to reproduce, paving the way for the forced sterilization of immigrants, people of color, disabled people and other disenfranchised groups throughout the 20th century.
According to Lorenzo and Deer, the sterilization of Native American women fits into a pattern of federal policies meant to disrupt Native people's reproductive autonomy, from the systemic removal of Indigenous children into government boarding schools and non-Native foster homes to the 1976 Hyde Amendment, which prevents tribal clinics and hospitals that receive federal funding from performing abortions in almost all cases.
In Canada, doctors have been sanctioned as recently as 2023 for sterilizing Indigenous women without their consent.
Deer said New Mexico's investigation could pave the way for accountability. But without cooperation from the federal government, Deer said the commission's fact-finding abilities would be limited.

Social media can be addictive even for adults, but there are ways to cut back
Social media addiction has been compared to casinos, opioids and cigarettes
- Bookmark
Social media addiction has been compared to casinos, opioids and cigarettes.
While there’s some debate among experts about the line between overuse and addiction, and whether social media can cause the latter, there is no doubt that many people feel like they can’t escape the pull of Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and other platforms.
The companies that designed your favorite apps have an incentive to keep you glued to them so they can serve up ads that make them billions of dollars in revenue. Resisting the pull of the endless scroll, the dopamine hits from short-form videos and the ego boost and validation that come from likes and positive interactions, can seem like an unfair fight. For some people, “rage-bait,” gloomy news and arguing with internet strangers also have an irresistible draw.
Much of the concern around social media addiction has focused on children. But adults are also susceptible to using social media so much that it starts affecting their day-to-day lives.
Recognizing signs of compulsive use
Dr. Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist and the medical director of addiction medicine at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, defines addiction as “the continued compulsive use of a substance or behavior despite harm to self or others.”
During her testimony at a landmark social media harms trial in Los Angeles, Lembke said that what makes social media platforms so addictive is the “24/7, really limitless, frictionless access” people have to them.
Some researchers question whether addiction is the appropriate term to describe heavy use of social media, arguing that a person must be experiencing identifiable symptoms. These include strong, sometimes uncontrollable urges and withdrawal to qualify as addiction.
Social media addiction is not recognized as an official disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is the standard reference psychiatrists and other mental health practitioners use to assess and treat patients. That's partly because there is no widespread consensus on what constitutes social media addiction and whether underlying mental health issues contribute to problematic use.
But just because there is no official agreement on the issue doesn't mean excessive social media use can't be harmful, some experts say.
“For me, the biggest signpost is how does the person feel about the ‘amount,’ and how viewing it makes them feel,” said Dr. Laurel Williams, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Baylor College of Medicine. “If what they discover is they view it so much that they are missing out on other things they may enjoy or things that they need to attend to, this is problematic use. Additionally, if you leave feeling overwhelmed, drained, sad, anxious, angry regularly, this use is not good for you.”
In other words, is your use of social media affecting other parts of your life? Are you putting off chores, work, hobbies or time with friends and family? Have you tried to cut back your time but realized you were unable to? Do you feel bad about your social media use?
Ofir Turel, a professor of information systems management at the University of Melbourne who has studied social media use for years, said there was “no agreement” over the term social media addiction, and he doesn’t “expect agreement soon.”
“It’s obvious that we have an issue,” Turel said. “You don’t have to call it an addiction, but there is an issue and we need, as a society, to start thinking about it.”
Noninvasive tips to reduce social media use
Before setting limits on scrolling, it's helpful to understand how social media feeds and advertising work to draw in users, Williams said.
“Think of social media as a company trying to get you to stay with them and buy something — have the mindset that this is information that I don’t need to act on and may not be true,” she added. “Get alternate sources of information. Always understand the more you see something, anyone can start to believe it is true."
Ian A. Anderson, a postdoctoral scholar at California Institute of Technology, suggests making small, meaningful changes to stop you from opening your social media app of choice. Moving the app’s place on your phone or turning off notifications are “light touch interventions,” but more involved options, like not bringing your phone into the bedroom or other places where you tend to use it, could also help, Anderson said.
Tech tools can also help to cut back on tech overuse. Both iPhones and Android devices have onboard controls to help regulate screen time.
Apple’s Screen Time controls are found in the iPhone’s settings menu. Users can set overall Downtime, which shuts off all phone activity during a set period of their choice.
The controls also let users put a blanket restriction on certain categories of apps, such as social, games or entertainment or zero in on a specific app, by limiting the time that can be spent on it.
The downside is that the limits aren’t hard to get around. It’s more of a nudge than a red line that you can’t cross. If you try to open an app with a limit, you’ll get a screen menu offering one more minute, a reminder after 15 minutes, or to completely ignore it.
If a light touch doesn't work
If a light touch isn't working, more drastic steps might be necessary. Some users swear by turning their phones to gray-scale to make it less appealing to dopamine-seeking brains. On iPhones, adjust the color filter in your settings. For Android, turn on Bedtime Mode or tweak the color correction setting. Downgrading to a simpler phone, such as an old-school flip phone, could also help curb social media compulsions.
Some startups, figuring that people might prefer a tangible barrier, offer hardware solutions that introduce physical friction between you and an app. Unpluq, for instance, is a yellow tag that you have to hold up to your phone in order to access blocked apps. Brick and Blok are two different products that work along the same lines — they’re squarish pieces of plastic that you have to tap or scan with your phone to unlock an app.
If that's not enough of an obstacle, you could stash away your phone entirely. There are various phone lockboxes and cases available, some of them designed so parents can lock up their teenagers’ phones when they’re supposed to be sleeping, but there's no rule that says only teenagers can use them.
Yondr, which makes portable phone locking pouches used at concerts or in schools, also sells a home phone box.
Seeking outside help
If all else fails, it may be a good idea to look for deeper reasons for feeling addicted to social media. Maybe it’s a symptom of underlying problems like anxiety, stress, loneliness, depression or low self-esteem. If you think that’s the case, it could be worth exploring therapy that is becoming more widely available.
“For people struggling to stay away — see if you can get a friend group to collaborate with you on it. Make it a group effort. Just don’t post about it! The more spaces become phone free, the more we may see a lessened desire to be ‘on,’” Williams said.

Trump’s global tariffs have finally been overturned. What next? | Steven Greenhouse

There’s no denying that the US supreme court’s long-awaited ruling that overturned Donald Trump’s global tariffs is important, and if the ruling turns out to be a harbinger that the court is ready to abandon its startling sycophancy toward the US president, it could prove hugely important. The ruling this Friday is the first time during Trump’s second term that the justices have struck down one of his policies. Not only that, the policy they struck down is Trump’s signature economic policy – he has used tariffs to bash, lord over and terrorize dozens of other countries and make himself the King of the Economic Jungle.
In the court’s main opinion, joined by three conservative justices and three liberals, chief justice John Roberts used some sharp language to slap down Trump’s tariffs, writing that the constitution specifically gives Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and tariffs. (Roberts noted that tariffs are indeed taxes.)
Roberts added that Trump had misinterpreted the law he invoked to impose tariffs against more than 80 countries, noting that the law – the International Emergency Emergency Powers Act – doesn’t mention the word tariffs even once as it lays out numerous ways presidents can regulate imports. Roberts added that if Congress had wanted to give presidents the power to impose tariffs under that law, it would have specifically said so.
In the tariffs case, Learning Resources Inc v Trump, Roberts seemed appalled at the extraordinary powers Trump had seized to impose whatever tariffs he wanted at any amount he wanted against any country he wanted. Roberts wrote that “the President asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope” and that under the administration’s reading of the law, “the President is unconstrained by the significant procedural limitations in other tariff statutes and free to issue a dizzying array of modifications at will.”
Over the past year, the court’s six-person conservative supermajority has ruled in Trump’s favor in a remarkably high percentage of shadow docket cases– letting Trump gut the Department of Education, letting Ice stop people based on their ethnicity, letting Trump refuse to spend appropriated USAID funds, letting the Pentagon discharge transgender service members.
After all that water-carrying for Trump, it’s encouraging to see the court stand up to him and trumpet in the tariff case that Trump was interpreting laws in implausible, illogical ways in order to use his executive powers to the max. It would be good, for instance, if the court similarly rules that Trump is interpreting the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in implausible, illogical ways when he seeks to deport Venezuelan immigrants without due process, even though that act applies only when the US is facing an armed, organized attack.
Soon after the tariff ruling was issued, Trump quickly slandered and savaged the justices who had ruled against him. “They’re just being fools and lapdogs” for political opponents, including “the radical left Democrats”, he said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution. It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests.”
Trump also said the justices who ruled against him were a “disgrace to our nation” and that he was “ashamed of” them “not having the courage to do what’s right for our country”. Trump beat up mercilessly on the six justices who ruled against him, including conservatives Roberts, Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch, even those three had ruled for Trump about 80% of the time in shadow docket cases, many of them highly controversial and contentious.
After Trump insulted the justices and whipped up Maga loyalists against them, let’s hope the justices will be more motivated to put their Trump sycophancy behind him and be more emboldened to rule against him. When will the justices admit to themselves that they shouldn’t be so quick to defer to Trump and shouldn’t rush to give him more power under the “unitary executive theory”, considering that he is so autocratic and thuggish and often pays scant heed to the law and the truth.
It’s high time that the high court realize that Trump’s elevator doesn’t go all the way to the top. Remember last December when he wrote that if the supreme court ruled against him in the tariffs case, that would be “the biggest threat in history” to US national security. In October, he said something even more ludicrous: that if the tariff ruling went against him, it “would literally destroy the United States of America.” (When I woke up this morning. the US was still standing,)
The importance of the tariffs case will turn in part on which of two roads the US supreme court will take: a limited, pro-corporate route or a broader, more robust course defending the constitution against the most authoritarian president in history.
Many US supreme court watchers predict that the high court will rule against Trump in only two important cases this year – cases in which much of Corporate America has parted ways with the president. Roberts and the other conservative justices don’t like to part ways with Corporate America. Those two cases are the tariffs case and the case in which Trump sought to fire Federal Reserve member Lisa Cook, without giving her any due process, after a Trump ally alleged that Cook made false statements on a mortgage application. She denied any wrongdoing.
Corporate America detests Trump’s tariffs, convinced that they muck up trade relations and undermine economic growth. Corporate America also opposes Trump’s heavy-handed effort to eliminate the Federal Reserve’s independence and transform it into a group of Trumpian puppets who will, per Trump’s wishes, slash interest rates, which could cause inflation to spike in a few years, very possibly after Trump leaves office. At a minimum, let’s hope the court rules for Cook over Trump, but doesn’t stop there.
Let’s hope the court removes its pro-Trump glasses and starts to see how he so often holds the truth and the law (and the justices) in contempt. We all need to stand up and defend the US constitution. And the US supreme court needs to do that more than anyone else.

Major Chinese technology companies, including ByteDance and Baidu, are aggressively expanding their US-based research and development teams, targeting high-level artificial intelligence and semiconductor recruits in key American tech hubs.
The overseas hiring spree underscores these “big tech” firms’ growing ambitions to build up their skilled workforce in AI systems development and semiconductor design amid increased competition in their home market.
Social media giant ByteDance, the parent firm of TikTok and Douyin, was the most active recruiter among its peers, with more than 100 AI-related job vacancies posted in San Jose, California and Seattle, Washington.

Cemented locks and deflated diggers: the war over privately run allotments
Unknown

22:00:08 KST

When police arrived at the field outside Bristol in October 2023, two old cars, wheels removed, were blockading the gates. Protesters had hauled them across the entrance to stop developers building on the slice of north Somerset green belt. The threat was not housing or industry, but a company building vegetable patches.
Roots builds privatised allotments to give city dwelling customers a place to grow food. It was co-founded in 2021 by Christian Samuel, Ed Morrison and William Gay, who were frustrated by a 28-year waiting list for a plot in their area of Streatham, south London. “We thought: ‘This is crazy’,” says Samuel, 32. “‘Why don’t we just build our own?’”
The idea was a runaway success. Roots now has 20 sites from London to Leeds, and nearly 5,000 customers. Last October the founders announced a £6m fundraise. Backers included Terry Leahy, the former Tesco chief executive and Mark Selby, co-founder of Wahaca restaurants. There are early plans for a site in Austin, Texas – Roots’ first abroad.
The startup leases farmland and turns it into plots that it rents out on subscription. Prices range from £9.99 to £49.99 a month for a patch of up to 108 sq metres. One adviser describes it as “WeWork for allotments”, a fresh air and wellies version of the coworking office space trend.
The appeal is obvious. More than 170,000 people are thought to be sitting on council allotment waiting lists across the country. “For many people it is not about growing the food, it’s the mental health and the wellbeing side of being outside,” says Samuel. “They see it as a place to escape. And there’s clearly a supply and demand gap here.”
Not everybody sees it that way. What started as a local protest in Bristol has turned into a nationwide opposition campaign. A Facebook group, Roots Allotments uncovered, has attracted more than 1,700 members. Opponents accuse the company of an aggressive expansion strategy, developing land first and applying for planning permission later – and only when councils force them to.
Simon Talbot-Ponsonby, 73, lives next to the Bristol site – a rented farmers’ field bordering Leigh Woods nature reserve – and was at the October 2023 standoff. He is chair of the nearby Abbots Leigh parish council, has been a regular presence at protests and accuses the founders of “trashing” the countryside.
Truckloads of compost were dumped across formerly grazed meadows, he says, with much of the remaining grass churned up and a shipping container dropped in the middle as a tool shed. An 80-space compacted stone car park was built to serve the 700 plots. “They have a total disregard for the feelings of local people,” he says.
Resistance has also sprung up elsewhere. In Ecclesfield, near Sheffield, the council denied planning permission in December, seven months after diggers rolled in and began removing hedgerows (the company has appealed against the decision). In West Sussex, there was outcry when Roots started work on protected land within the South Downs national park.
Nor are some opponents averse to some old-fashioned sabotage. In Bristol, protesters poured cement into the locks so the gates couldn’t be opened. One night in early 2024, someone deflated the tyres on the Roots diggers – then filled the valves with superglue for good measure.
The old cars from the October blockade kept reappearing, too. Roots installed lockable bollards in the road to keep them out, but when staff returned a week later, the vehicles had mysteriously appeared on the other side. On another occasion someone sowed grass seed on a fresh delivery of compost. “It’s amazing how quickly it turns green,” says Talbot-Ponsonby.
“Residents were so frustrated by the fact that they were going ahead without permission,” Talbot-Ponsonby says, clarifying that he did not take part in the acts of “minor vandalism”. He adds: “We’re all law-abiding citizens, but when people are frustrated they do things.”
The founders see themselves as victims of a zealous nimby campaign. Samuel calls them “haters” and recounts an incident when somebody recognised him at Bath Spa railway station and slapped him on the back of the head. He points to footage of people obstructing Roots’ Bristol site during a volunteer tree-planting day. “Even when we were planting trees we had to call the police,” he says “They’re relentless.”
He insists that allotments are agriculture and do not need planning permission on greenbelt land, citing permitted development rules. Opponents say the scale – with shipping containers, irrigation systems and hundreds of plots – makes them commercial developments that need approval.
Charlotte Bovill, a Roots customer in south Croydon, says there are “bigger problems in the world” than allotments being built on the green belt. The 34-year-old probation officer, who works with people convicted of violent crimes daily, says her patch is a source of “bliss and escapism”.
Council waiting lists are an “absolute nightmare”, Bovill continues, and many people living in cities do not have gardens to store tools or space for composting, both of which Roots provides. “The satisfaction of being able to nurture and grow something is a lot more rewarding than most things in everyday life.”
Nonetheless, trouble seems to follow the startup around. Its name on Companies House, Allotta Futureland, has raised suspicions among opponents that it could be a front to eventually develop houses, which Samuel strongly denies. His case was not helped when a shipping container at a Roots site in Bath was converted into a holiday let in 2024, complete with outdoor decking and a hot tub. It was later removed.
The environmental campaigner Chris Packham has even gone after them. “Increasing access to green spaces is a must – and allotments are a great way to do that,” he wrote of the Bristol site in 2024. “But when you’re a venture capital-backed firm developing on species rich grassland, with breeding skylarks … you’re in the wrong Roots Allotments.”
Packham’s criticism hints at the fundamental tension around Roots’ model. Allotments have long been viewed as a public good, run by councils, rather than as a commercial opportunity for fast-growing startups.
When Roots tried to lease council-owned land in Brighton three years ago, Mark Carroll, chair the city’s allotment federation, told a local newspaper: “Sadly, this follows a pattern of public services with huge waiting lists becoming run down and the private sector stepping in to offer an alternative to those who can afford it.”
Roots’ prices reinforce those claims. A full size plot of 108 sq metres will set you back just under £550 a year, where many councils charge less than £100 for a similar sized patch.
While not yet profitable, Allota Futureland had assets of £1.7m in 2024, when it last filed accounts, more than treble the previous year. JamJar Investments, the venture capital firm founded by the creators of Innocent smoothies, holds a 13% stake, alongside Redbus Ventures, a tech investment firm, and Leahy and Selby’s smaller holdings.
Samuel admits he can “see the argument on both sides” but that ideas cost money. “It’s not cheap to do this and I don’t think the fact that we’ve had investment should really matter. We are doing something good with the money.”
Crucially, however, Roots sites are available, while land set aside for council allotments has fallen by about 65% since the 1950s across England. Since Labour took office in 2024, the government has approved the sale of eight more allotment sites to help fund new housing. “We are adding to supply,” says Samuel.
And the company shows no sign of slowing down. Another fundraise is planned in the coming months, which will help pay for more dramatic expansion. As many as 20 more sites are due to open this year, and by 2033, Roots hopes to have 1,000 sites worldwide and 250,000 customers.
Meanwhile, back in Bristol, Roots was finally granted planning permission in summer 2025, but now faces another problem: the water has been shut off. Bristol Water cut the supply last autumn after finding Roots had simply tapped into the farmer’s cattle trough pipe. The company is now applying for a commercial connection.
“It’s just another example of them not following the rules,” says Talbot-Ponsonby. “That’s the way they work.”
Despite the sabotage, planning battles and now the water shutoff, Samuel remains unbowed. “We hear every day that thousands of people want these things, and we’re not planning on stopping,” he says. “All this over growing a bunch of aubergines.”

DIU Eyes First Launch for Its Commercial Hypersonic Testbed

The Defense Innovation Unit is gearing up for the first flight of its commercially developed hypersonic testbed as soon as the end of February—part of a larger project to quickly increase the cadence of the Pentagon’s hypersonic flight testing and field advanced, high-speed systems and components at scale.
As part of DIU’s Hypersonic High-Cadence Advanced Testing program, or HyCAT, the mission will pair Rocket Lab’s HASTE launcher with a high-speed testbed called DART AE, built by Australian firm Hypersonix. The scramjet-powered DART will deploy in a suborbital hypersonic environment with the goal of collecting key propulsion, aerothermal, and vehicle control data to support future Defense Department testing. The mission will lift off from Wallops Island in Virginia “no earlier than late February,” Rocket Lab announced earlier this month.
The flight will be HyCAT’s second since DIU launched the program in 2022. The first took place last November in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency. During that flight, Rocket Lab’s HASTE flew multiple unnamed payloads, including one developed by Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory.
HyCAT was established amid a broader push within DOD to actually field the hypersonic weapons capabilities the military services have spent years developing, like the Air Force’s Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon and the Army’s Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon. Because the cost, availability, and fidelity of testing infrastructure is often a limiting factor in getting a complex capability over the finish line, the department has in recent years homed in on creating more hypersonic flight test opportunities and eventually increasing its flight test cadence to one test per week. Programs like HyCAT and the Test Resource Management Center’s Multi-Service Advanced Hypersonics Testbed are making some progress, but the Pentagon has yet to reach that goal.
Under the Trump administration, DOD has maintained its focus on hypersonic development and testing. Pentagon Chief Technology Officer Emil Michael recently identified “scaled hypersonics” as one of the department’s six critical technology imperatives. HyCAT’s work to foster and demonstrate the utility of commercial technology for complex DOD challenges like hypersonics is in line with direction from Pentagon leaders like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has called for the acquisition community to prioritize speed and scale and leverage private sector expertise—and capital—where possible.
Lt. Col. Nicholas Estep, director of DIU’s emerging technology portfolio, told Air & Space Forces Magazine the second HyCAT mission is unique in that it features a nontraditional commercial aerospace firm, Hypersonix, demonstrating air-breathing hypersonic propulsion—a complex engineering challenge that doesn’t currently have a commercial market.
Estep declined to discuss the flight’s performance objectives due to sensitivities, and wouldn’t say whether DART is expected to reach hypersonic speeds, though he noted that the intent is for the data collected to “show relevance” to DOD’s hypersonic community.
“This is just a very novel situation,” he said. “We’re pairing commercial companies, we’re leveraging as much commercial infrastructure as possible, and using a commercial liquid booster for this type of payload is unique. There’s lots of new things we’re intending to be able to demonstrate with this.”
Rocket Lab’s HASTE is a suborbital version of its workhorse Electron rocket, which launches small satellites for national security and commercial customers. The company modified the vehicle to support high-speed test missions in 2022 in response to the Pentagon’s hypersonics push and HASTE flew its first mission for MACH-TB in June of 2023.
Meanwhile, the upcoming HyCAT mission will be the first flight for Hypersonix and its DART AE. DART is powered by the company’s SPARTAN scramjet engine and is envisioned to eventually serve as a reusable hypersonic vehicle.
“This flight reflects years of engineering work and the confidence of our partners at DIU, NASA, and Rocket Lab,” Hypersonix CEO Matt Hill said in a statement. “It brings us a meaningful step closer to operational hypersonic systems that are reusable, sustainable, and strategically relevant for Australia and for our allies.”
While HyCAT’s early missions have focused on launch systems and test vehicles, Estep said the project is also working with companies—which he declined to name—to prototype and test targets, subsystems, and advanced materials.
“We’re going to do the near-term rapid prototyping to instill utility of those things so that they can then process to these other areas—whehter they’re specific targets that are leveraged by the community or maybe they’ll be leveraged as a subset of some testbed infrastructure for future flight validation,” he said. “If it’s a subscale payload or a subsystem that we can validate through flight, that can then transition to more traditional programs of record. All of those pathways exist and we collaborate with all of them.”

Indian, Brazilian leaders vow to boost bilateral trade to $20B over next 5 years
Indian Premier Narendra Modi hosts Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva for bilateral talks in New Delhi
NEW DELHI
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Saturday vowed to boost bilateral trade to $20 billion over the next five years.
Modi held “extensive engagements” with Lula, who is on a state visit to New Delhi and also attended an AI summit organized by India this week, Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on US social media company X.
Modi said the talks focused “on ways to deepen” the India-Brazil trade partnership.
“We are committed to taking bilateral trade much beyond $20 billion in the next five years. Our nations will also work closely in areas such as technology, innovation, Digital Public Infrastructure, AI, semiconductors and more. This will benefit the people of our nation,” Modi wrote afterwards on X.
Jaiswal said both leaders reiterated their vision “for an inclusive and multipolar world order.”
“They also called for urgent reform of the United Nations, in particular the UN Security Council,” he said, adding that 10 outcomes were finalized in areas such as critical minerals and digital cooperation.
“Both leaders committed to raise bilateral trade over $20 billion in the next five years,” he added.
Modi said in his press statement: "When India and Brazil work together, the voice of Global South becomes stronger and more confident"
Trade between the two nations reached $12.54 billion in 2024. Diplomatic ties were established in 1948.
India and Brazil are members of the BRICS bloc – also including Russia, China, South Africa, and other countries – with India as its current chair.

Fico announces termination of energy supplies to Ukraine if oil supplies not restored by Mon
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico announced his intention to terminate emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine if Ukraine does not restore oil supplies interrupted after the accident on the Druzhba oil pipeline near the Ukrainian city of Brody, Lviv region in January on Monday, February 23.
"IF THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT DOES NOT RESUME OIL SUPPLIES TO SLOVAKIA ON MONDAY, ON THAT SAME DAY I WILL ASK THE RELEVANT SLOVAK COMPANIES TO STOP EMERGENCY ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES TO UKRAINE," Fico wrote on X.
"The Ukrainian president refuses to understand our peace-oriented approach and, because we do not support the war, he is behaving maliciously toward Slovakia," Fico wrote.
"First, he halted gas flows to Slovakia, causing us damages of EUR 500 million per year. Now he has stopped oil flows, causing us further losses and logistical difficulties. If the West does not mind that the Nord Stream gas pipeline was blown up, Slovakia cannot accept Slovak-Ukrainian relations as a one-way ticket benefiting only Ukraine," the Slovak Prime Minister wrote.
"I am a proud and sovereign Slovak. If oil supplies to Slovakia are not resumed on Monday, I will ask SEPS, the state-owned joint-stock company, to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine. In January 2026 alone, these emergency supplies, needed to stabilize the Ukrainian energy grid, were required twice as much as during the entire year of 2025," he added.
"Since the beginning of the war, Slovakia has been helping Ukraine. Around 180,000 Ukrainians are currently on our territory, we provide humanitarian assistance, and we organize joint government meetings. We are doing substantially more for Ukraine than some other countries," Fico wrote.
As previously reported, Hungary halted diesel fuel exports to Ukraine on Feb. 18 until transit of Russian crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline is restored, Hungarian Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Relations Zoltan Kovacs said. He argued that Ukraine "for purely political reasons unilaterally stopped supplies on January 27, even though their restoration is technically possible." Slovakia also announced it was halting diesel exports to Ukraine.
Hungary and Slovakia had earlier asked Croatia to allow Russian oil supplies to flow through the Adria pipeline. Slovakia has since declared a state of emergency in its oil sector due to the lack of supply.
Croatian Economy Minister Ante Susnjar said the Adria pipeline is ready to operate, adding that there are no longer any technical justifications for any EU country to remain dependent on Russian crude oil.
Transit of Russian crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline via Ukraine was halted at the end of last month following large-scale Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

Andrew arrest could prompt parliamentary inquiry into trade envoys
- Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested this week on suspicion of misconduct in public office following allegations made after the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.
- An influential group of MPs on the Business and Trade Committee is now considering launching a parliamentary probe into the role of UK trade envoys, prompted by Andrew's arrest.
- The potential inquiry would focus on governance issues and accountability within the trade envoy system, avoiding specific commentary on Andrew until criminal proceedings are concluded.
- Reports suggest Lord Peter Mandelson backed Andrew's appointment as trade envoy, despite King Charles reportedly expressing opposition to his brother taking the role.
- The government is reportedly considering legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession once police investigations into his alleged misconduct are complete.

Jeffrey Epstein held a bank account at BNP Paribas between 2008 and 2018

Among the millions of pages in the Epstein files is a letter unremarkable except for the fact that the French bank BNP Paribas was addressing it to "Mr. Epstein Jeffrey": "Dear Sir, we are pleased to inform you that your INFINITE card is available at your branch. You may collect it from today (...)." Dated August 21, 2014, the letter, corroborated by several hundred other documents declassified by the US Department of Justice, confirms that the disgraced financier and notorious sex offender held a current account and a savings account at BNP Paribas.
Epstein kept only a small portion of his wealth in this account, ranging from $50,000 to just over $200,000 depending on the year. He still conducted numerous transactions through it. The account remained open until mid-2018, as shown by the documents.
How did Epstein, surrounded by such a toxic reputation, manage to hold an account at a bank known for its vigilance over reputational risks? More importantly, how did he keep it until 2018? Don't banks have the freedom to drop "high-risk" clients? What about the core rule in the fight against money laundering, "know your customer," which requires banks to identify clients and flag suspicious activity so it can be stopped?

US military assets in the Middle East
The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier entered the Mediterranean Sea on Friday, further boosting American firepower in a region that has seen a massive military buildup ahead of potential strikes against Iran.
Below, key US military assets deployed in or near the Middle East are examined.
Ships
Washington currently has 13 warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier -- the USS Abraham Lincoln -- nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships, a US official said.
The Ford -- the world's largest carrier -- was seen transiting Strait of Gibraltar toward the Mediterranean in a photo taken on Friday. It is accompanied by three destroyers, and when in position will bring the total number of US warships in the Middle East to 17.
Both carriers are crewed by thousands of sailors and have air wings comprised of dozens of warplanes. It is rare to have two of the massive warships in the Middle East at the same time.
Aircraft
In addition to the aircraft on the carriers, the United States has sent dozens of other warplanes to the Middle East, according to open-source intelligence accounts on X, flight-tracking website Flightradar24 and media reports.
These include F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning stealth fighter jets, F-15 and F-16 warplanes, and the KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft that are needed to sustain their operations.
Air defenses
The United States has also reportedly boosted its land-based air defenses in the Middle East, while the numerous guided-missile destroyers in the region provide air defense capabilities at sea.
US forces on bases
While ground forces are not expected to take part in offensive action against Iran, the United States has tens of thousands of military personnel on bases in the Middle East that are potentially vulnerable to a counterattack.
Tehran launched missiles at a US base in Qatar after Washington struck three Iranian nuclear sites in June 2025, but they were shot down by air defenses.

Ukraine imposes sanctions on 225 captains of ships of Russian shadow fleet
According to Ukrinform, the president's press service reported this.
One of the decisions is aimed at combating the Russian shadow fleet: Sanctions have been imposed on 225 ship captains who export Russian petroleum products.
Among them are citizens of 11 countries, including Russia, India, and the Philippines.
Monitoring of the situation in the Black, Red, and Baltic Seas showed that these captains commanded ships of the Russian shadow fleet and transported oil in circumvention of sanctions imposed by the European Union, G7, and other states.
Most of these tankers, 188 of them, are already under sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
“We continue to convince our partners of the importance of individual sanctions against tanker captains. Systematic work aboard a sanctioned tanker is sufficient grounds for consequences. We must eliminate the incentive to work with Russian oil, because it directly finances the war,” emphasized Advisor – Commissioner of the President for Sanctions Policy Vladyslav Vlasiuk.
The second package of sanctions includes 46 Russian citizens, two Iranian citizens, and 44 Russian companies that serve the Russian military-industrial complex. Among them are those who supply, develop, manufacture, and repair equipment, electronic warfare systems, and spare parts for the Russian military-industrial complex. Their products are used in the production of ballistic and cruise missiles, combat and reconnaissance drones, small arms, and ammunition.
Two Iranian citizens are involved in supplying aircraft parts and components in circumvention of sanctions. This was done in the interests of the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industries Corporation, Russia's partner in the development and production of Shahed drones, which is already under sanctions imposed by Ukraine, the US, Switzerland, and New Zealand.
Ukraine will share this information with its partners to ensure synchronization and will continue expanding sanctions against other people and companies that help Russia's aggression.
As reported by Ukrinform, Zelensky announced that Ukraine is imposing sanctions against the self-proclaimed president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, who not only provided Belarusian territory for the deployment of Oreshnik but also allowed Russia to supply critical components for this weapon.

Giant tortoises reintroduced to a Galapagos island
February 21, 2026Nearly 150 years after giant tortoises vanished from Floreana Island in Ecuador's Galapagos archipelago, the species has made a long‑anticipated return.
Ecuadorian authorities this week released 158 juvenile tortoises, each between 8 and 13 years old. The release is the first phase of a larger plan to reintroduce 700 animals to the island.
"For the first time in over a century, Floreana is once again home to giant tortoises, a species that plays a strategic role as ecosystem engineers: seed dispersers, vegetation regulators, and promoters of natural habitat regeneration," the environment ministry said Friday.
Genetic link to the original species
The young tortoises carry between 40% and 80% of the genetic makeup of "Chelonoidis niger," the species that disappeared in the 19th century due to invasive mammals, whaling, fire and human exploitation.
According to the ministry, the juveniles were bred at a Galapagos National Park facility using animals with strong genetic ties to Floreana's lost lineage. Officials hope the long‑term resettlement effort will eventually restore the original species profile on the island.
National Geographic identifies 13 living species of Galapagos tortoises on other islands in the archipelago. Adults can weigh more than 250 kilograms (550 pounds), and the oldest known individual lived to age 175.
Returning to a changed landscape
Officials say the timing of the release is favorable, with seasonal rains creating conditions that will help the tortoises adjust to their new environment.
The tortoises will now share Floreana with a small human population and a diverse range of native wildlife. They will also face threats from invasive species, which conservationists say remain a major challenge.
Floreana resident Veronica Mora said seeing the tortoises return was deeply meaningful for the community.
"We are seeing the reality of a project that began several years ago," she said, calling the release a source of collective pride.
Researchers are also working to bring back 12 additional endemic species to Floreana as part of a wide‑scale rewilding initiative.
The Galapagos Islands, a World Heritage Site, lie about 1,000 kilometers off Ecuador's coast and are known for their unique biodiversity.

Both sides stormed through the group stage of the 2026 edition and look heavy favourites to at least reach the semifinals, with the Indians clear favourites to lift the trophy once again.
Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the most mouth-watering match-up of two of the heavy contenders for the crown so far at the tournament.
India gunning for South Africa’s top order
India’s bowlers will target early wickets against South Africa, said bowling coach Morne Morkel on Friday.
“We know that their top order gives them that momentum, with Quinton (de Kock) and Aiden (Markram) up front in good form and hitting the ball very well,” said the former South Africa quick bowler Morkel.
“We will definitely put our best foot forward to try and get those early wickets.”
How did India reach the T20 World Cup Super Eights?
India stormed their group to claim top spot with four wins from four. A slightly nervous start against USA was followed by a thumping 93-run win against Namibia.
The game everyone had their eyes on was the latest pairing with rivals Pakistan, which resulted in a 61-run win, while the final game saw the Netherlands fall only 17 runs short of their 194 target.
How did South Africa reach the T20 World Cup Super Eights?
South Africa opened their tournament with a 57-run win against Canada, but needed a Super Over to confirm their win against Afghanistan in their second match.
New Zealand were given a thumping by the Proteas, who claimed a seven-wicket win to confirm their passage to the Super Eights with a game to spare, before completing the group with a six-wicket win against the UAE.
India expect Abhishek to return to form soon
While Markram’s South Africa have looked strong in all departments, tournament favourites India have not enjoyed batting consistency, with opener Abhishek Sharma out of form. Morkel, though, predicts he will be back among the runs soon.
Morkel said the left-hander, who has recorded three consecutive ducks, was just one innings away from getting back in the zone.
“Absolutely no discussion in our team group about that,” said Morkel about Abhishek’s failure to score in any of the matches yet.
“He is a world-class player. We are going to a very important phase of the World Cup now and I am sure he is going to deliver.
“I am pretty sure he is hitting the ball in the nets.
“It is just a matter of getting the start and getting the innings going.”
Can South Africa be the team to stop India at the T20 World Cup?
Morkel acknowledged South Africa have been one of the form teams of the T20 World Cup so far.
“They are a team that’s full of confidence,” said Morkel.
“They have got guys at the top who are in form. In terms of weaknesses, there aren’t many.”
South Africa have also shown guts when needed, coming out victorious after two nerve-shredding super overs against Afghanistan.
“For us it comes down, on the day, to how well we execute with the bat and the ball,” said Morkel of defending champions India.
“It’s going to be world-class players against each other. It is going to be a mouth-watering thing.”
South Africa’s De Kock says handling pressure key in India clash
Who “deals with the pressure better” will decide the India-South Africa Super Eights match, said Quinton de Kock on Saturday.
The two unbeaten teams are familiar foes, and Markram’s South Africa toured India late last year, losing 3-1 in a T20 series.
“I think that’s what’s going to make for quite a good game, because we’ve played against each other quite a bit over the last two months,” said South Africa opener De Kock.
“And to be honest, the teams haven’t really changed much.
“So, I think it’s more when you’re out there on the pressure side, who deals with the pressure better and wins the small moments in the game.”
While South Africa looked strong in all departments in the group phase, the batting of the defending champions, India, has been inconsistent.
Opener Abhishek Sharma has recorded three consecutive ducks, but De Kock did not read too much into it.
“He’s the number one T20 batsman in the world at the moment, according to the rankings, so he must keep doing what he’s doing,” said de Kock of the 25-year-old Abhishek.
“He’s obviously quite young; he’s bound to fail. So I’m sure at some point he’s going to play an important knock.”
What is India’s record in T20 World Cup cricket?
Not only are India the defending champions after their victory against South Africa at the 2024 edition, but they are also the joint-record winners of the T20 World Cup.
The Indian side won their inaugural event in 2007, beating Pakistan in the final, but that made for a long wait for their second win at the last edition.
England and the West Indies have both also recorded two tournament wins.
What is South Africa’s record in T20 World Cup cricket?
South Africa still await their first T20 World Cup title. In fact, the wait goes on for the Proteas to lift any trophy at a major ICC tournament.
Their seven-run defeat at the hands of India in the 2024 edition was their first appearance in a final of either a T20 World Cup or a 50-over Cricket World Cup.
South Africa make surprise wholesale T20 changes for future tour
South Africa have named a much-changed squad that includes five uncapped players for their five-match Twenty20 tour of New Zealand next month, leaving behind most of the team that have qualified for the Super Eights at the ongoing World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.
Batters Connor Esterhuizen, Dian Forrester and Jordan Hermann, all-rounder Eathan Bosch and teenage seamer Nqobani Mokoena will all hope to make their international debuts on the tour.
Hermann is the younger brother of Rubin, who is also in the squad and has been capped in One Day Internationals and T20 matches for South Africa, while Bosch is the younger sibling of Corbin, who has impressed at the World Cup.
The side will be captained by spinner Keshav Maharaj, with a return for seamers Gerald Coetzee, Lutho Sipamla and Ottneil Baartman.
Three players from the current World Cup squad will tour: Maharaj, spinner George Linde and all-rounder Jason Smith.
“With this series taking place directly after the T20 World Cup, the majority of that squad will return home, which creates a great opportunity for this group of players to step into the international environment and show what they’re about at this level,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad said.
The five-match series will be played between March 15 and 25.
Head-to-head
This will be the 36th meeting between the sides in T20 internationals. India have won 21 of the matches, while South Africa have claimed victory on 13 occasions with one no result/abandonment.
Predicted India team:
Ishan Kishan (wk), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav (c), Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh, Axar Patel, Varun Chakaravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh
Predicted South Africa team:

Japan 'totally' unqualified for permanent UN Security Council seat: China
Beijing calls for enabling more small and medium-sized states with independent foreign policies to be part of council
ISTANBUL
China has reiterated its opposition to Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, accusing the longtime rival of posing "new threats" to regional peace and stability and being "totally" unqualified, Chinese media reported on Saturday.
Addressing a UN General Assembly Friday session on negotiations over equitable representation and an increase in Security Council membership, China's UN Ambassador Fu Cong said Japan is unfit for a permanent seat on the council, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Fu said Japan has "persistently refused to reflect on its wartime crimes of aggression, openly trampled on the postwar international order, and interfered in the sovereignty of other countries, thereby posing new threats to regional peace and stability."
Such a country is "totally unqualified" for a permanent seat on the Security Council, he argued.
Japan is a proponent of reforms to the council, but has not responded to China’s accusations.
Tensions between Beijing and Tokyo have escalated since last November, when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a Chinese attack on Taiwan could legally constitute a “survival-threatening situation,” potentially allowing Japan to exercise the right of collective self-defense. The remarks triggered a backlash from China.
Outlining three "key" points for Security Council reform, Fu said that the council must not become a “club” of major powers, and reform should not benefit only a very small number of countries.
Secondly, he went on to say, reform should "genuinely" enhance the representation and voice of developing countries by enabling more small and medium-sized states with independent foreign policies to enter the council, and in particular, historical injustices suffered by Africa must be corrected, with priority and special arrangements made to address Africa’s legitimate demands.
"Third, reform should not be confined to the current global landscape; rather it should be planned with strategic vision and a long-term perspective," he added.

Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klaebo becomes 1st athlete to win 6 gold medals at a Winter Games
Norway's Johannes Høsflot Klaebo continued his historic run at the Milan Cortina Games by setting the record for most golds by one athlete in a single Winter Olympics.
Klaebo's victory in the 50-kilometer mass start race shattered the nearly 50-year record set by American speed skater Eric Heiden, who won five golds at the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. However, all of Heiden's wins were in individual races and two of Klaebo's have come in team events, so Heiden's record for individual wins still stands.
Klaebo's teammates, Martin Loewstroem Nyenget, took silver, and Emil Iversen, won bronze in a Norwegian sweep.
The three Norwegians broke out to an early lead and then continued to build the gap on their chasers.
In the final lap, Nyenget and Klaebo pushed uphill and dropped Iversen. Klaebo stayed in second, waiting to launch his textbook charge uphill.
As the two reached the final hill, Klaebo literally ran away from Nyenget and was bound for glory.
As he glided toward the finish, he pointed his fingers toward the sky, took one stride across the line, toppled over on his right hip and rolled onto his back.
The 29-year-old entered the Games with five gold medals to his name. With his six medals at Milan Cortina, he has broken and extended the previous record of eight for most career Winter Olympic gold medals.
He is now the second-most decorated gold medalist in Olympic history after American Michael Phelps, who has 23.
The win gave Norway a record 18th gold medal and further increased their lead in the total medal count in these games to 40 overall.
Team Norway broke its own gold medal record at a single Winter Olympics on Friday when Johannes Dale-Skjevdal won the 15-kilometer mass start biathlon race.

Fico threatens to cut Ukraine’s emergency power over oil transit dispute

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico on Saturday threatened to cut off emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine if Kyiv does not restore oil flows to Slovakia by Monday, escalating a deepening energy dispute in Central Europe.
“If the Ukrainian president does not resume oil supplies to Slovakia on Monday, on that same day I will ask the relevant Slovak companies to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine,” Fico wrote on social media.
Fico said he would instruct SEPS, Slovakia’s state-owned grid operator, to halt the emergency power exports that have helped stabilize Ukraine’s energy system amid repeated Russian attacks. In January alone, the volume of emergency supplies needed to support Ukraine’s grid was twice as high as during the whole of 2025, he said.

Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ aims to turn Gaza into a playground for investors

A sweeping investment and reconstruction plan to transform the ruins of Gaza into a playground for investors was unveiled at the first meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” in Washington, D.C, on Thursday.
The plan to reconstruct Gaza, framed as the transformation of the Strip into a beachfront economic hub, would see the Strip become “an investment center,” while Palestinian political aspirations were left unaddressed. The reconstruction plan mirrors longstanding Israeli schemes for the gradual ethnic cleansing of Gaza under the guise of building temporary “humanitarian cities” for Palestinians in Rafah. As a U.S.-led body with Trump as its ultimate decision-maker, the Board has been described by most Palestinian factions as a colonial instrument reminiscent of the British Mandate.
Joining the meeting on Thursday from the Trump administration were Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, and Trump himself. Participating countries included all the mediators in the Gaza ceasefire deal — Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey — as well as other Arab and Islamic states that took part in early consultations on Trump’s so-called “peace plan,” including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia. Indonesia, Albania, Argentina, and El Salvador also attended. Israel, through its Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, officially joined the Board earlier in February but did not participate in its first meeting.
Recent reports also indicate that the Board of Peace and its role in Gaza will facilitate the United States’ broader military and political positioning in the region. According to The Guardian, the United States has begun planning a new military base in the southern part of the Strip that would host 5,000 personnel. The compound would cover approximately 1,400 square meters, including a shooting range and warehouses, and would be surrounded by barbed wire and 26 watchtowers.
Who runs Gaza on paper?
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, signed last October, previewed the formation of the Board of Peace as the ultimate political authority overseeing the reconstruction of the Strip. It also outlined two additional bodies: an “Executive Committee” to make decisions on Gaza, and the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a Palestinian-led committee of ostensibly politically unaffiliated technocrats tasked with administering day-to-day affairs in the Strip. The technocratic committee represents the only formal Palestinian participation in Trump’s postwar plan.
The technocratic committee was formed with the approval of all the Palestinian factions, including Hamas. Ali Shaath, head of the technocratic committee, attended the meeting on Thursday, but neither the Palestinian Authority (PA) nor the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) attended.
Buck after bang
When announcing the board last October, Trump made membership contingent on participating countries contributing $1 billion. At Thursday’s meeting, billionaire Marc Rowan, Apollo Global Management’s CEO and a member of the board, presented elements of a reconstruction plan.
According to Rowan, the first phase would include building 100,000 housing units to accommodate half a million people, along with $5 billion in infrastructure projects. The long-term vision, according to Rowan, would include the construction of 400,000 housing units and $30 billion in civilian infrastructure.
Rowan’s proposal is part of his role on the Board’s Executive Committee, which also includes Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner outlined what he described as a “master plan” to transform Gaza into an investment opportunity earlier in January at Davos. The proposal envisions tourism, beach resorts, industrial zones, and corporate facilities, with limited residential areas — a vision critics say erases Gaza’s Palestinian identity.
An investment-driven approach also featured prominently in Rowan’s presentation. He described Gaza’s beachfront as “worth $50 billion,” arguing that transforming the territory from a “destruction zone” into an “investment center” is the Board’s greatest challenge.
The vision echoes Trump’s earlier plans, first presented in February 2025, of establishing a “Riviera of the Middle East” on top of Gaza’s ruins.
What Israel wants: ethnic cleansing
The plan to reconstruct Gaza in areas such as Rafah is in line with previous Israeli proposals to reduce Gaza’s Palestinian population through what officials have termed “voluntary migration” after having “concentrated” them in so-called “humanitarian cities.”
On the ground, that vision appears to be gaining traction. Israel has sought to allow more Palestinians to exit through the Rafah crossing than to return, prompting Egyptian pushback, while Israel also continues to use the crossing to harshly interrogate Palestinians and pressure them to leave the Strip.
Within Gaza, Israel continues to make life unbearable for Palestinians. Israeli forces have continued targeting Palestinians who approach the “Yellow Line,” which splits Gaza in half.
According to international organizations, aid entering the Strip remains far below required levels, let alone the agreed-upon conditions set out in the ceasefire terms. According to local authorities, Gaza continues to face acute shortages of fuel, medicine, and basic food supplies. Meanwhile, Israel continues its assassination and airstrike campaign across Gaza, killing over 600 Palestinians since the ceasefire began last October, according to local authorities.
But the main way in which Israel seeks to exacerbate living conditions in the Strip is by continuing to stall reconstruction. The Board’s inaugural meeting was expected to trigger the reconstruction process, particularly through financial commitments from member states, but Israel continues to cite Hamas disarmament as a precondition.
While several countries made financial pledges at the meeting, with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar each pledging $1 billion toward reconstruction in the coming years, and the United Arab Emirates pledging $2.5 billion, reconstruction remains theoretical. Construction materials are still awaiting Israeli approval to cross into Gaza.
The Palestine question deferred
Speeches at the Thursday meeting focused on “early recovery” and ending the “humanitarian crisis” in Gaza. A two-state solution and Palestinian rights were mentioned in brief remarks by representatives of Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, and Kuwait. Shaath said the technocratic committee would establish a new police force, for which 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza have already applied, stressing that there should be a single authority responsible for security and reconstruction.
Yet the pledged funds and initiatives remain contingent on political arrangements determined by Trump and coordinated with Israel. Israel has not permitted Shaath’s committee to enter Gaza and continues to oppose Turkish and Qatari participation in a proposed stability force, which has yet to be formed.
In his speech, Trump framed Gaza primarily through Israel’s security concerns, stating that Hamas must disarm or face severe consequences. Rubio said the only alternative to Trump’s peace plan was a return to war, a scenario that would mean a resumption of the genocide.
The vision taking shape between Washington and Israel appears detached from the multibillion-dollar pledges announced at the board’s meeting, where funding dominated discussions and the political framework remained secondary.
For many in Gaza, the dominant reality remains a lower-intensity continuation of the genocide — and reconstruction promises that have so far failed to materialize.

Terrorists kill 50, abduct women, children in northwestern Nigeria
After overnight attack stretching into Friday morning, victims' bodies have been prepared for mass burial
LAGOS, Nigeria
At least 50 people were killed and several women and children abducted in an attack on a village in Nigeria's northwestern Zamfara State.
The assault, carried out by terrorists locally referred to as bandits, began Thursday night and continued into Friday morning, with attackers on motorcycles setting fire to buildings and shooting residents of the village of Tungan Dutse, who tried to flee
Hamisu Faru, a state lawmaker, confirmed the incident to Anadolu on Saturday.
“No one slept since Thursday and this morning. Some people lost three family members,” Faru told Anadolu.
The victims' bodies have been prepared for a mass burial, with corpses robed in white on Saturday. The number of abductees remains unclear, as local officials continue to account for the missing.
Nigeria's security situation is quite dire, especially in the country’s northwest, where Zamfara is located. The area has been plagued by bandit attacks, kidnappings, and killings, with thousands displaced and many more vulnerable.
The Nigerian government has taken some steps to address the issue, including deploying troops and collaborating with international partners like the US for technical support and intelligence sharing.
However, the situation remains challenging, with overlapping security threats from armed criminal gangs and rebel fighters.

Just after appointment, key prosecutor in US state of Virginia dismissed by Justice Department
Deputy attorney general says judges do not have authority to appoint US attorneys, says president holds power, after panel of judges ruled former US attorney was appointed unlawfully
ANKARA
A key US prosecutor in the US state of Virginia has been removed from his post, a senior Justice Department official has announced, just hours after his appointment by a panel of judges.
The move is the latest in a series of battles in which the Trump administration has tried to bypass established procedures for naming prosecutors without congressional approval, as laid out in the US Constitution.
The administration has sought to temporarily name judges without congressional approval, and then reappoint them when their short-term tenure expires. Judges have called the maneuver illegal.
On US social media company X, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche – a former personal attorney for US President Trump – announced on Friday that James Hundley, who was serving on an interim basis as US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA), had been removed from his post. He had been appointed by judges earlier in the day.
Blanche quoted a news report telling how Hundley was appointed after Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s last choice for the post, stepped down earlier this year due to a court ruling that found her appointment unlawful.
“Here we go again. EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS (the president) does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” wrote Blanche.
In the post, Halligan had prepared indictments concerning former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both seen as enemies of Trump, but with little success.
In a separate development, Donald T. Kinsella, who had been assigned by federal judges to replace John A. Sarcone, a prosecutor appointed by Trump as US attorney in the Northern District of New York, was also dismissed by the White House within hours of his appointment.

Fico Warns He Will “Stop Emergency Electricity Supplies to Ukraine” Over Oil Transit

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said he may move to halt emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine if oil deliveries to Slovakia are not resumed.
In a post on X, Fico warned that “if the Ukrainian president does not resume oil supplies to Slovakia on Monday, on that same day I will ask the relevant Slovak companies to stop emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine.”

Fico said Slovakia has provided extensive support to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, including humanitarian aid and hosting around 180,000 Ukrainian refugees. He added that Bratislava has done “substantially more for Ukraine than some other countries.”
At the same time, Fico accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of acting “maliciously” toward Slovakia because, he said, Kyiv does not accept Bratislava’s “peace-oriented approach.”
According to Fico, Ukraine previously halted gas transit to Slovakia, causing losses of €500 million ($589 million) per year and has now stopped oil flows, leading to further financial and logistical problems.
“If the West does not mind that the Nord Stream gas pipeline was blown up, Slovakia cannot accept Slovak-Ukrainian relations as a one-way ticket benefiting only Ukraine,” Fico wrote, adding that Slovakia is a “proud and sovereign country.”
He said that if oil supplies are not restored, he would ask SEPS, Slovakia’s state-owned electricity transmission operator, to suspend emergency power supplies to Ukraine. Fico claimed that in January 2026 alone, such emergency deliveries to stabilize Ukraine’s energy grid were needed twice as often as during all of 2025.
European Commission Urges Hungary To Respect €90B Ukraine Loan Deal
Citing what he described as Zelensky’s “unacceptable behavior” toward Slovakia, Fico also said he considered it “absolutely correct” to refuse Slovakia’s participation in a recent €90 billion military loan for Ukraine.
The disruption comes as Ukraine faces an electricity deficit following repeated Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, making emergency power imports critical.
Oil transit through Ukraine to Slovakia and Hungary stopped in late January after Russia struck a pumping station on the Druzhba pipeline. As a result, Ukraine was forced to halt oil flows to refineries in both countries.
To secure supplies, Slovakia and Hungary began drawing on strategic reserves and approached Croatia about alternative deliveries via its port and pipeline system. Croatian authorities agreed to assist, but without transporting Russian oil.

Cargo ship navigator arrested 'for professional negligence' after deadly collision in central Japan
2 people were killed after cargo ship collided with fishing boat in Mie prefecture on Friday
ISTANBUL
The Japanese Coast Guard on Saturday arrested "for professional negligence" the navigator of a cargo ship, which collided with a fishing boat in central Japan on Friday afternoon and left two people dead, local media reported.
Hanon Sugimoto, 21, was at the helm of the 499-ton, 71-meter (233-foot) cargo vessel at the time of the collision, the Tokyo-based Kyodo News reported, citing the Coast Guard office in the Toba city of the Mie prefecture.
She was alone on the bridge when the vessel with a crew of six, which was heading to the western Japanese city of Kurashiki without any cargo, hit the side of the 16-ton fishing boat that was anchored with 13 people aboard, the report said.
Two men on the fishing boat, aged 84 and 67, drowned, while its captain and 10 other passengers sustained injuries.

Zelenskyy signs decree on sanctions against Russian shadow fleet, companies servicing enemy military-industrial complex
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed decrees No. 130/2026 and 131/2026, which put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) on the application of new sanctions packages.
Ukraine imposed sanctions Saturday against 225 ship captains who export Russian petroleum products as part of efforts to counter Russia’s shadow fleet, according to the Ukrainian president’s website. The captains are citizens of 11 countries, including Russia, India and the Philippines.
"We continue to convince partners of the importance of individual sanctions against tanker captains. Systematic work on a sanctioned tanker is sufficient grounds for consequences. We must discourage people from working with Russian oil, as it directly finances the war," said Vladyslav Vlasiuk, adviser and presidential envoy for sanctions policy.
Monitoring of the Black, Red and Baltic seas showed that the captains commanded vessels of Russia’s shadow fleet and transported oil in circumvention of sanctions imposed by the European Union, the Group of Seven and other nations. The majority of those tankers — 188 — are already under sanctions by the EU, the United States, Britain, Switzerland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
A second sanctions package targeted 46 Russian citizens, two Iranian citizens and 44 Russian companies servicing Russia’s military-industrial complex.
Among those targeted are companies that supply, develop, manufacture and repair equipment, electronic warfare systems and spare parts for Russia’s military-industrial complex. Their products are used in the production of ballistic and cruise missiles, strike and reconnaissance drones, small arms and ammunition.
"Two Iranian citizens were involved in supplying aviation spare parts and components in circumvention of sanctions. This was done in the interests of the Iranian Aviation Industries Organization, which is a partner of Russia in the development and production of Shahed drones and is already under sanctions by Ukraine, the United States, Switzerland and New Zealand," the statement said.
Ukraine will share the relevant information with partners for coordination and will continue to expand sanctions against other individuals and entities facilitating Russian aggression, the statement said.

Ukrainian documentary on Russian war crimes wins Berlinale Panorama Audience Award
The documentary Traces by Ukrainian directors Alisa Kovalenko and Marysia Nikitiuk won the Panorama Audience Award at the 76th Berlin International Film Festival.
Source: Berlinale organisers on Facebook; Ukrainian State Film Agency; Alisa Kovalenko, a director of Traces, in an interview with Detector Media, a Ukrainian NGO and analytical media outlet
Details: The world premiere of the Ukrainian documentary Traces took place on 16 February in the Panorama Dokumente programme.
The film focuses on Ukrainian women who, during Russia's aggression against Ukraine, endured sexual violence and torture and refuse to remain silent, the Ukrainian State Film Agency said.
Quote from the Ukrainian State Film Agency: "Through the story of Iryna Dovhan, a former captive and head of Sema Ukraine, who became an activist and now documents testimony from women affected in the liberated territories of Ukraine, the film creates a collective portrait of trauma while also opening space for hope.
The documentary is both a record of war crimes and Russia's systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war in Ukraine as well as testimony to the resistance and resilience of women who stand shoulder to shoulder." [Sema Ukraine is a survivor-led non-governmental organisation (NGO) of Ukrainian women who have experienced sexual and gender-based violence as a result of Russia's war against Ukraine.]
More details: The Ukrainian State Film Agency said that director Alisa Kovalenko knows this difficult subject from within, saying she had also suffered conflict-related sexual violence while in captivity in Donbas at the very start of the Russo-Ukrainian war.
She became one of the first women in Ukraine to speak about it publicly.
Quote from Alisa Kovalenko: "When I testified back in 2016, it turned out that I was the first and only person who openly spoke about what I had lived through at that time. Now, 10 years later, together with six other women, my fellow sisters, we are presenting this film at Berlinale. This is an incredible change, another stone knocked out of this wall of silence."
More details: As Traces was not part of the official selection, it did not compete for the Golden Bear or Silver Bear. Its nomination in the Panorama section made it eligible for the audience award. The Panorama Audience Award for best feature film and best documentary at Berlinale has been awarded since 1999.

Two soldiers killed during military operation in Pakistan’s northwest: Army
An explosive-laden motorcycle rammed vehicle in security forces convoy, military says.
Two soldiers, including a lieutenant colonel, have been killed during a military operation when a fighter driving an explosive-laden motorcycle rammed a security convoy vehicle in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province near the border with Afghanistan, according to the country’s army.
The deadly clash took place on Saturday in KP’s Bannu district, with the Pakistani military saying at least five armed fighters, including one it described as “a suicide bomber” were also killed during the operation.

The military said that the bomber was stopped by the leading security team, preventing his attempt to attack civilians and law enforcement personnel and averting “a major catastrophe”.
The army referred to the fighters as “khawarij” – the term it uses for banned groups, including the Pakistan Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Islamabad has repeatedly accused the Taliban administration in Kabul of providing refuge to the TTP, a banned Pakistani group separate from but linked to the Afghan Taliban, though Kabul has denied the allegations.
The two countries had previously clashed in a brief border conflict in October last year.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the statement said.
“Such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” it said.
Repeated attacks
Bannu has long been a frequent flashpoint for armed violence, with repeated attacks on security forces and police checkpoints in recent years.
Security officials have reported strikes on police installations, suicide bombings and armed assaults in the district, part of a broader surge in armed rebel group activity across KP after the TTP ended a ceasefire with the government in late 2022.
Earlier this week, two bomb attacks and a gun battle between police and rebel fighters killed more than a dozen people in the province. One child and 11 security personnel were killed in an attack in Bajaur district, the Pakistani military said, while seven others, including women and children, were injured in the incident.

The European Commission expects Hungary and other EU member states to uphold a political agreement reached by EU leaders in December 2025 and proceed with the adoption of a €90 billion ($105 billion) loan package for Ukraine for 2026–2027.
The statement comes after Hungary blocked the approval of the package and signaled it would continue to do so unless Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Commission cites December political agreement
According to European Pravda, European Commission spokesperson Balázs Ujvári said Brussels expects Budapest to stand by the commitment made at the European Council meeting on Dec. 19, 2025.
“At the European Council meeting in December, a unanimous political agreement was reached to provide €90 billion in resolute support for Ukraine’s budgetary and military needs over the next two years,” Ujvári said.
He emphasized that the agreement had already been translated into concrete legislative steps.
“On this basis, on January 14, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals,” he noted.
“We expect all member states to respect this political agreement with a view to the final adoption of the loan,” the spokesperson added.
The Commission’s statement underscores the distinction between political endorsement by EU leaders and the formal legislative approval required to activate the financial instrument.
Hungary links approval to oil transit
Hungary has openly linked its opposition to the €90 billion package to the oil transit dispute. In a post on X, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó wrote: “We are blocking the €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until oil transit to Hungary via the Druzhba pipeline resumes.”
Ukraine Imposes Sanctions on 225 Captains of Ships of Russian Shadow Fleet
He accused Ukraine of “blackmailing Hungary by halting oil transit in coordination with Brussels and the Hungarian opposition to create supply disruptions in Hungary and push fuel prices higher before the elections.”
Szijjártó further claimed that by blocking oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline, Ukraine was violating the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement and breaching its commitments to the EU. “We will not give in to this blackmail,” he wrote.
Ukrainian authorities have said the Druzhba pipeline was shut down after being damaged during a Russian attack near the western Ukrainian city of Brody. Kyiv, for its part, has proposed an alternative route for oil supplies to Hungary and Slovakia via the Odesa–Brody pipeline.
Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico on Wednesday threatened to cut emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine if Kyiv does not reopen the pipeline. Fico declared a state of emergency over oil supplies and said he had ordered the release of 250,000 tons of oil from Slovakia’s emergency reserves.
Hungary and Slovakia had requested that Croatia allow the supply of Russian oil through the Adria pipeline as an alternative route. Croatia, however, signaled it would not facilitate such shipments. In a post on X, Energy Minister Ante Šušnjar criticized continued purchases of Russian oil. “A barrel bought from Russia may appear cheaper to some countries, but helps fund war and attacks on Ukrainian people,” he wrote. “It’s time to stop that war profiteering.”
The Hungarian government has constantly argued that the suspension of oil flows affects energy security in Central Europe. Orbán and Fico have maintained closer ties to Moscow than most EU leaders since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Orbán recently described Ukraine as an “enemy” of the state, highlighting the deep strain in relations between Budapest and Kyiv.
Background of the loan plan
The European Council agreed on Feb. 19, 2025, to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan for 2026–2027, financed through EU borrowing on capital markets and backed by guarantees from the EU budget. The funds are intended to support both Ukraine’s state budget and its military needs during the ongoing war with Russia.
At the time, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic declined to participate in the scheme but pledged not to obstruct it.
The Commission’s response reflects concern in Brussels that a commitment endorsed unanimously by EU leaders could unravel at the legislative stage.
By invoking the December agreement and the subsequent legislative proposals, the Commission signaled that it views the matter as one of honoring a collective decision already taken at the highest political level.
Whether Hungary will lift its veto remains unclear. For now, the approval of one of the EU’s largest financial support packages for Ukraine remains tied to an unrelated dispute over oil transit.

Prue Leith shares advice for ‘frightened’ Nigella Lawson ahead of Great British Bake Off debut
It was announced last month that the celebrity chef will be stepping in to replace Prue Leith
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Dame Prue Leith has some words of wisdom for Nigella Lawson as she prepares to join Great British Bake Off as the show’s new judge.
It was announced in January that the celebrity chef will succeed Leith for the next series of the popular baking competition.
Leith announced she would be stepping down from the post she has held for nine years, a role she took over from Dame Mary Berry in 2017, the same year the show moved over from the BBC to its new home on Channel 4.
“It’s daunting to be following in the footsteps” of both Leith and Berry, said Lawson last month.
Asked in a new interview with The Telegraph whether she has any tips for her successor, Leith replied simply: “Just enjoy it, because you’ll never have a nicer job.”
Another tip, she added, is always double check before posting anything on social media – a reference to the time that Leith prematurely tweeted about the winner of the 2017 series before it aired on TV. She had been travelling in Bhutan and got confused over the time zones.
“I felt like an absolute idiot,” Leith told The Telegraph. “It was horrible at the time, although everybody involved in the show was remarkably nice about it.”
Leith, however, will not be tuning into to watch Lawson on the show, having never watched Bake Off before she joined or during her own tenure.
“I hardly ever watch telly, and if I do it’ll be a travel programme, because my husband likes things involving people going to extraordinary places,” she said.
Lawson’s arrival to Bake Off marks her most high-profile gig in the UK in years. Recently she has focused on her TV career in Australia, where she’s been a regular guest on MasterChef and My Kitchen Rules.
Her appointment has been praised by many fans of the series, including The Independent’s Rachel McGrath who called it an “ingenious casting for a show that’s gone a bit stale”.
Lawson, who published her first cookery book, How to Eat, in 1998, and has presented numerous BBC specials since Nigella Bites aired in 1999, is expected to bring her signature flair and cooking innuendos into the Bake Off tent next season.
The Great British Bake Off is expected to return later this year, following a celebrity edition confirmed for spring, featuring stars including Molly-Mae Hague.

Beyond the Golan: The Israeli case for reclaiming southern Syria's Bashan - opinion
Unknown

This past Sunday night, a small group of Israelis quietly crossed the security fence on the Golan and walked into history.
They were neither armed nor violent. Instead, members of the Pioneers of Bashan simply went to lay a cornerstone for a future Jewish community in an area under Israeli control in southern Syria.
The IDF quickly detained them and escorted them back, but not before they declared that “settlement in Bashan is essential to preserve the achievements of the war.”
Many Israelis will dismiss the episode as fringe activism, a curiosity, or even a provocation.
They shouldn’t. The Bashan is part and parcel of our ancestral patrimony and is critical for Israel’s security. In December 2024, after the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, the IDF entered the buffer zone on the Golan Heights and liberated the highest peak of Mount Hermon, along with much of the surrounding area, which is part of the Bashan. It is time to bolster Israel’s presence and make it permanent by allowing Jews to settle there.
Mentioned dozens of times in the Tanach, the Bashan is a vast volcanic plateau – much larger than the Golan Heights – stretching from the slopes of Mount Hermon in the north down toward the Yarmuk River in the south and eastward, deep into what is today southern Syria’s Hauran plain.
The Golan Heights that Israel controls today forms only the western edge of this historic region.
Its black basalt soil, formed by ancient lava flows, created exceptionally rich pasture land. That is why the Bible speaks of the “fatlings of Bashan” (Ezekiel 39:18), a symbol of fertility and prosperity.
When the Israelites approached the Promised Land, it was in the Bashan that they defeated the mighty kingdom of Og. The Bible recounts that Israel captured 60 fortified cities in the area (Deuteronomy 3:4), and the territory was subsequently allotted to the half-tribe of Manasseh.
In other words: The Jewish story in the North does not begin with the modern State of Israel. It begins with Moses.
Long before diplomats invented ceasefire lines, Jewish sovereignty in the Bashan was part of the original map of Israel.
But Jewish life in Bashan did not end with the Bible. During the Second Temple period, the region contained numerous Jewish towns and fortresses. The city of Gamla became one of the fiercest centers of resistance to Rome in 67 CE during the First Jewish Revolt.
In the centuries that followed, Jewish communities flourished across the plateau. Rabbinic sources refer to scholars known as the Rabbis of Nawa, or Neveh (Jerusalem Talmud, “Sanhedrin” 3:5), and Torah sages who lived and taught in Bashan during the Mishnaic and Talmudic eras. Archaeologists have uncovered dozens of synagogues and villages bearing Hebrew inscriptions and menorah carvings, proof of sustained Jewish rural life long after the Temple’s destruction.
Even in the early Zionist period, Jewish settlement returned. Lands in Bashan were purchased in the late 19th century, and Jewish farming villages briefly existed there more than a century ago, before regional instability forced their abandonment.
For nearly 3,000 years, the Jewish map included Bashan, whether Jews ruled it or not.
Modern Israelis tend to think of the Golan Heights as a military buffer, a defensive necessity born in 1967. That is true but incomplete. The Golan is only the western slope of the ancient Bashan.
Historically, whoever controlled Bashan controlled the approaches to the Galilee. The plateau overlooks northern Israel like a balcony over a courtyard. Armies descending from the northeast, whether Arameans in ancient times or Syrians in modern ones, repeatedly used it as an invasion corridor.
But military control without a civilian presence has repeatedly proven temporary; areas held only by soldiers are treated as provisional, and provisional borders rarely endure.
After the Hasmonean conquest in the 2nd century BCE, Jews again settled the region and built communities there.
After the Six-Day War, Israel returned to the Golan, part of the Bashan, for the same reason: survival.
And now it is time for the Jewish people to reclaim the Bashan.
SOME VIEW the activists who crossed the fence this week as reckless. But the question they raised is serious: What happens when Israel controls territory militarily yet refuses to treat it as part of its national future?
Security control without a civilian presence is temporary by definition. Soldiers defend; civilians anchor. Without a population that believes possession of the land is permanent, hesitation eventually replaces deterrence.
Every Israeli knows this intuitively. We saw it in southern Lebanon. We saw it in Gaza.
A rare strategic moment
And today we see it in the unstable Syrian arena – militias, proxies, and jihadist factions competing for influence just kilometers from Israeli towns. The collapse of central authority across the border has created a rare strategic moment – a window that history suggests will not remain open indefinitely.
Now is the time to seize the opportunity.
The “oaks of Bashan” (Isaiah 2:13) – a biblical symbol of strength – were once shorthand for the northern reaches of the Jewish homeland. Even today, a community on the Golan bears that ancient name – Alonei Habashan.
Hence, the pioneers detained earlier this week were not inventing a claim; they were reviving one.
To be sure, no responsible government can permit civilians to cross an active military border zone. The army was correct to remove them.
But dismissing them would be a mistake.
Because the activists highlighted something deeper than policy: a strategic hesitation at the heart of Israeli thinking. We control land but fear to belong to it. We hold territory but avoid its meaning.
And yet, Jewish history repeatedly shows that settlement follows security, and then creates it.
From the Galilee to the Negev, from the Jordan Valley to the Golan, presence became protection.
The question facing Israel is not whether a handful of activists should establish a hilltop outpost beyond a fence. The question is whether the Jewish state understands that some places are not bargaining chips but foundational pillars.
Bashan was conquered by Israel under Moses, and it became a borderland repeatedly contested across history.
Today, once again, the territory stands between Israel and the chaos of the Levant.
The Bashan is knocking, awaiting the return of its children, the Jewish people.
Israel must now decide whether it hears it as noise or as a call.

Cuban military, medical advisers leave Venezuela as US pressure mounts on Rodriguez

Cuban security advisers and doctors have been leaving Venezuela as Interim President Delcy Rodriguez's government faces intense pressure from Washington to unwind Latin America’s most consequential leftist alliance, according to 11 sources familiar with the matter.
Venezuela’s Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has entrusted her protection to Venezuelan bodyguards, according to four of the sources, unlike deposed president Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor, the late president Hugo Chavez, who both relied on elite Cuban forces.
Thirty-two Cubans were killed in the US military attack that captured Maduro on January 3, according to the Cuban government. These soldiers and bodyguards were part of a deep security agreement between Caracas and Havana that began in the late 2000s, in which Cuban intelligence agents were embedded throughout the military and Venezuela’s formidable DGCIM counterintelligence unit, which was fundamental to weeding out domestic opposition.
“The Cuban influence was absolutely essential” to the survival of the Chavista government, said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of history at New York University and an expert on Venezuela.
Inside DGCIM, some Cuban advisers have been removed from their posts, according to a former Venezuelan intelligence official. Some of the Cuban medical workers and security advisers have traveled from Venezuela to Cuba on flights in recent weeks, two of the sources said.
One source close to Venezuela’s ruling party said the Cubans were departing on the orders of Rodriguez due to US pressure. The other sources were not clear on whether the Cubans were being forced to leave by the new Venezuelan leadership, departing of their own accord, or being summoned home by Havana.
The decision to sideline Cubans from the presidential guard and the counterintelligence unit has not been previously reported.
Trump wants to end Cuba-Venezuela ties
Prior to the operation to remove Maduro, thousands of Cuban doctors, nurses and sports coaches worked in Venezuela as part of welfare programs begun under Chavez. In exchange, Venezuela provided Cuba with a source of much-needed oil.
Following the US attack, US President Donald Trump vowed to end the security relationship between Venezuela and Cuba. “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!,” he wrote on Truth Social on January 11.
In response to questions about US pressure on Venezuela to cut ties with Cuba, a White House official said the US has “a very good relationship with the leaders of Venezuela” and that it believes that Rodriguez’s “own self-interest aligns with advancing our key objectives.”
Severing Venezuela’s relationship with Cuba is part of Washington’s broader strategy of toppling Havana’s communist-run government. Since mid-December, Washington has blockaded Venezuela from shipping oil to Cuba, economically strangling the island.
The US government is “talking to Cuba, whose leaders should make a deal,” the official said.
The Cuban government has said it is open to dialogue on equal terms, while condemning the oil blockade and vowing to resist US intervention.
Neither the Cuban nor the Venezuelan governments responded to requests for comment. The two countries have publicly affirmed their continued relationship.
Rodriguez, the daughter of a former Marxist guerrilla, has been a longtime ally of Maduro and a member of Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party. She’s also personally close to the Cuban government, according to ten US and Venezuelan sources.
On January 8, Rodriguez appeared alongside Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez at a flower-laden memorial service in Caracas for the victims of the US attack.
“To the brave Venezuelan people, we express Cuba’s deepest solidarity,” Bruno Rodriguez said at the event, before uttering the rallying cry of one of the leaders of the Cuban revolution, Ernesto “Che” Guevara: “Hasta la victoria siempre.”
Later in January, Delcy Rodriguez also spoke by phone with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, saying afterwards that the two countries remained “united.” Diaz-Canel, after the same call, said Cuba was committed to “continue strengthening the historic relations of brotherhood and cooperation.”
Regarding the relationship between the two countries, the White House official said: “President Trump understands that they have to make certain statements for domestic political reasons.”
Back to Cuba
A source familiar with the Cuban government’s thinking said that some military personnel injured in the US attack have returned to Cuba, but that others have remained active in Venezuela. The source also said many Cuban doctors continue to provide care in Venezuela.
Cuba’s state-run media in early January said a suspension of commercial flights and the closure of Venezuelan airspace had caused a backlog that prevented Cuba from bringing home doctors on vacation or from ending their missions in Venezuela. Those flights resumed the week after the January 3 US attack, those reports said.
A US source familiar with the matter said that while the Cuban presence is diminishing, some undercover intelligence agents are likely to remain in the country to see how the political situation pans out.
Frank Mora, who served as US ambassador to the Organization of American States under the Biden administration, said, “Rodriguez is treading very carefully.”
“She wants to keep the Cubans at a distance until this situation calms down, until her hold on power is clear, but not entirely throw them under the bus, either,” Mora said.
At least some Cuban military advisers are still working in Venezuela, four sources familiar with the matter said. Cuban professors also continue to teach at the state university for police and security forces, known as UNES, according to a former police officer.
John Polga-Hecimovich, a professor at the US Naval Academy in Maryland who has studied the role of Cuban security advisers in Venezuela, said the legacy of the Cuban counterintelligence effort is still evident in Caracas, where Maduro’s top loyalists remain in power.
“The Cubans didn’t manage to protect Maduro, but they played a key role in keeping the Chavista government in power," Polga-Hecimovich said. “The coup-proofing worked brilliantly.”

US moves dozens of F-35, F-15 fighter jets to Jordanian airbase - report

The United States military has moved dozens of fighter jets to a Jordanian air force base, according to satellite imagery and flight tracking data analysed by the New York Times on Friday.
More than 60 jets were pictured parked on the Muwaffaq Salti base in central Jordan, which is three times more than the usual number of US attack aircraft present on the base, according to the Times.
According to the Times report, at least 68 cargo planes have additionally landed on the base since Sunday, and several US drones and helicopters were seen in the area.
Soldiers were spotted installing new air defenses, systems that the Times theorized would be used to protect the base from potential Iranian strikes.
A live map of US Central Command (CENTCOM) movements, created by Tel Aviv University-affiliated think tank the Institute for National Security Studies, showed that as of Saturday afternoon, 30 F-35 fighter jets and 36 F-15 fighter jets were present at the Muwaffaq Salti base.
US troops, defense agreements in the Middle East
Jordanian officials, speaking to the Times on the condition of anonymity, stated that the deployment of US aircraft and equipment is a part of a larger defense agreement with the US.
The officials additionally shared that they hoped negotiations between the US and Iran would lead to a deal and prevent war in the region, as tensions between the two nations intensify.
According to an additional Times report on Friday, US troops across the Middle East have been shuffled around as the possibility of US strikes on the Iranian regime looms.
Troops from the Al Udeid base in Qatar and bases in Bahrain were moved for unspecified missions and operations, the Times reported, citing US military officials.
Iranian MP urged Jordanian forces to seize Muwaffaq Salti base
Earlier in February, Mojtaba Zarei, a pro-regime Tehran MP and member of Iran’s Foreign Policy Commission, urged Jordanian forces to attempt to seize the Muwaffaq Salti base.
In a post on X/Twitter on February 2, Zarei claimed that the base was used “in protecting Tel Aviv and the Zionist cannibals” during the 12-day war in June, during which US and Israeli forces destroyed much of Iran’s nuclear weapon manufacturing infrastructure.
“Prepare yourselves to seize it and take American soldiers captive,” Zarei pleaded, stating that the base “has turned into the most important American base in the world-devouring empire and a partner of Israel.”

Jewish return to Temple Mount brings renewed memory and hope - opinion
Unknown

21:28:37 KST

The haftarah for the Torah portion of Terumah (I Kings 5:26-6:13) describes what is arguably the most ambitious construction project in Jewish history: the building of the First Temple by King Solomon.
It is not a passage filled with miracles, prophecy, or war but with measurements.
Cubit upon cubit. Cedar beams. Gold overlay. Carved cherubs. Windows recessed within thick walls.
At first glance, it reads like an architectural blueprint rather than sacred literature. Yet that is precisely the point.
The Torah portion commands the construction of the mishkan (Tabernacle) in the wilderness, while the haftarah presents its permanent successor in Jerusalem. Together they teach a revolutionary Jewish idea: Holiness is experienced not only in moments of inspiration but is also constructed through deliberate effort in physical space.
God does not merely appear. We make room for Him.
“And they shall make Me a sanctuary, and I shall dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8).
Not in it – but among them.
The Divine Presence rests upon a people who actively prepare a place for it. As taught by the Kotzker Rebbe (Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, 1787-1859), God is to be found where we let Him in.
Focal point of Jewish national identity
Solomon’s Temple was not simply a religious building – it was the focal point of Jewish national identity. Every tribe, every pilgrim, converged upon a single mountain in Jerusalem. The Temple unified heaven and Earth, priest and farmer, king and shepherd.
When the Temple stood, Jewish longing had an address. And when it was destroyed, Jewish yearning became history’s longest memory.
For nearly two thousand years, Jews have prayed facing one direction – geographically, not metaphorically. Every wedding shattered a glass to recall its loss. Every Passover ended with “Next year in Jerusalem.” Every synagogue echoed something absent.
We did not simply remember the Temple: We organized our civilization around its absence.
But in recent years, something remarkable has begun to unfold.
Increasing numbers of Jews have ascended the Temple Mount, not merely as tourists but as worshipers.
For decades after 1967 Jews were discouraged, even intimidated, from praying there. The holiest site in Judaism became the only holy site in the world where Jews were effectively barred from worship.
History, however, has a momentum of its own.
Today, thousands of Jews ascend the Mount according to halachic (Jewish legal) guidelines. Many immerse beforehand. Many whisper psalms. Some bow. Increasingly, they pray openly.
This is neither a political movement nor a provocation.
It is a spiritual reflex.
A people that recited three daily prayers for the restoration of the Temple cannot indefinitely remain strangers to its location.
In light of this, the haftarah’s architectural precision now takes on renewed meaning.
Judaism does not await a vague utopia. The prophets describe courtyards, gates, and altars, all of which are tangible realities in a tangible place.
Faith in Judaism has a strong geographic component. Sinai happened somewhere. Hebron is somewhere. The Temple Mount is somewhere.
The growing Jewish presence there reflects continuity. It is what happens when a people takes its liturgy and longing seriously.
If King Solomon measured walls because holiness requires structure, Jewish history measures time because redemption requires preparation.
You cannot pray daily for the rebuilding of the Temple while emotionally treating the Temple Mount as irrelevant.
Eventually, prayer demands proximity.
Critics portray Jewish prayer on the Mount as destabilizing. But longing for one’s sacred site is not radical – it is human.
The haftarah reminds us that the Temple was built through devotion. It carried a vision from Sinai to Jerusalem.
Today’s Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount are not forcing redemption: They are expressing hope in Jewish memory and faith in our collective destiny.
They stand where prophets rebuked kings, and face the place toward which Jews have prayed in every exile – Babylon, Spain, Poland, Morocco, Yemen, and America.
For the first time in two millennia, Jews can physically ascend the place their prayers never abandoned.
History has closed a circle.
At the haftarah’s conclusion, God tells Solomon: “If you walk in My statutes… I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake My people” (6:12-13).
The Temple was never guaranteed by stone alone. It depended on spiritual readiness.
Perhaps that is why this generation approaches the Mount not in triumph but with yearning – descendants returning to a long-lost home.
Parashat Terumah teaches that a sanctuary begins with a terumah, a lifting of the heart.
The renewed Jewish presence on the Temple Mount may be exactly that: a collective offering of memory and hope.
And a people that still longs for the Divine Presence is already preparing a place for it. May we witness it soon.

IDF says forces on high alert amid tensions with Iran, no change to public advisories

The IDF addressed the public on Friday through IDF spokesperson Effie Defrin, reassuring citizens about their readiness amid escalating tensions with Iran.
Defrin stated that the IDF remains on high alert and is prepared for any changes in the operational situation.
“We are closely monitoring regional developments and are aware of the public discourse regarding Iran," He said. "The IDF is ready to defend; our eyes are open in all directions, and we are more alert than ever in response to any changes in the operational reality.”
Defrin emphasized that there has been no change in the current security guidelines and urged the public to rely only on official announcements from the IDF spokesperson channels and the Home Front Command.
US military buildup
Shortly before his statement, it was reported that the United States aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, had arrived in the Mediterranean Sea as part of preparations for a potential conflict.
The United States has significantly increased its military presence in the Middle East after US President Donald Trump warned Iran that it must reach an agreement within “a maximum” of 15 days, or else “bad things will happen.”
According to former Pentagon officials and national security experts, this US military buildup is substantial enough to support an air campaign lasting several weeks, with its scale and the speed of military buildup making an attack highly likely.
The US military presence in the Middle East resembles the buildup before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and is even larger than the recent American military buildup in the Caribbean ahead of the attempted capture of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
"This is a buildup like what we saw just before the Iraq War in 2003, especially in terms of air power," said Becca Wasser, a military strategy expert at the New American Security Institute.
Iran’s maritime threat
Meanwhile, the Alma Research Institute analyzed Iran’s maritime threat in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iran has employed threatening rhetoric regarding the possible closure of the strategically important strait and has conducted large-scale naval exercises in the area. Key insights from the analysis indicate that Iran's control over Gulf islands and coastal areas enhances its operational capabilities.
Iran frequently uses fast-attack boats, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mines, and swarm tactics to challenge superior naval forces. Its advanced arsenal, which includes anti-ship missiles, drones, and more than 1,000 unmanned vessels, strengthens Iran’s deterrence.

Polish Sejm plans to adopt resolution in support of Ukraine
This was announced by Marshal of the Polish Sejm Włodzimierz Czarzasty in an interview with Ukrinform.
"The Sejm plans to adopt a resolution expressing solidarity with Ukraine and Poland's support for those affected by the ongoing Russian aggression on the fourth anniversary of its start. The Polish Sejm has consistently expressed its solidarity with Ukraine. At the initiative of the Ukrainian Embassy in Warsaw, we are also opening an exhibition in the Sejm showing Russian attacks involving Shahed drones," Czarzasty said.
He added that the position of the Polish Sejm is unequivocal: Warsaw condemns Russia's aggression and supports Ukraine.
“There is no ambiguity here,” said the marshal of the Polish Sejm.
As reported by Ukrinform, a series of events will be held in Warsaw, Gdańsk, Lublin, and Kraków to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including solidarity rallies, memorial events, exhibitions, film screenings, concerts, and meetings dedicated to the Ukrainian struggle, joint weaving of camouflage nets, and more.
The Ministry of Culture of Ukraine has granted permission to conduct search operations in the area of the former village of Huta Peniatska, now within the towns of Zharkiv and Holubytsia in the Lviv region.

Hungary to block key EU loan to Ukraine until Russian oil shipments resume

Hungary will block a planned 90-billion-euro ($106-billion) European Union loan to Ukraine until the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline resumes, Hungary's foreign minister said.
Russian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since January 27, after Ukrainian officials said a Russian drone attack damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe.
Hungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil, have accused Ukraine — without providing evidence — of deliberately holding up supplies.
In a video posted on social media Friday evening, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart oil shipments. He said his government would block a massive interest-free loan the EU approved in December to help Kiev to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.
“We will not give in to this blackmail. We do not support Ukraine’s war, we will not pay for it,” Szijjarto said. “As long as Ukraine blocks the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary, Hungary will block European Union decisions that are important and favorable for Ukraine.”
Hungary's decision to block the key funding for Ukraine came two days after it suspended shipments of diesel to its embattled neighbour until oil flows through the Druzhba were resumed, and only days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale offensive.
Indispensable fuels
Nearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Yet Hungary — an EU and NATO member — has maintained and even increased its supply of Russian oil and gas.
Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long argued Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for its economy and that switching to energy sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse.
Not all of the EU's 27 countries agreed to take part in the 90-billion-euro loan package for Ukraine. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opposed the plan, but a deal was reached in which they did not block the loan and were promised protection from any financial fallout.

‘My daughter had measles as a baby – 45 years later a devastating complication of the virus killed her’
Subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE) is a rare complication of the measles affecting just 1 in 50,000 cases – but it can be prevented by the MMR
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
When Sarah Walton caught measles at nursery at just 11 months old, she was too young to get the vaccine that could have protected her from the life-threatening vrius.
She recovered well and didn’t suffer any serious illness, but 25 years later she developed a rare and “devastating” brain condition called subacute sclerosing pan-encephalitis (SSPE), which is caused by a mutation of the measles virus.
After 20 years spent “battling” the condition, which eventually robbed her of her ability to walk, talk and even swallow, Sarah died last year at the age of just 45.
Now, as the latest outbreak of the potentially fatal virus takes hold in northeast London, Sarah’s mother, Jo Walton, is urging parents to get their children vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab.
Ms Walton, said: “Sarah's, fondest hope, when she discovered how ill she was, was that nobody else would go through what she was going through. I am so sad to discover that there have been all these cases of SSPE since Sarah’s death… it's a pointless illness. It is an illness that doesn't need to happen. It's an illness that shouldn't be happening in the 21st century.”
“Measles can be fatal in itself. Measles can cause encephalitis (swelling of the brain), it can cause lifelong disabilities. Measles can cause devastating neurological illness, like what Sarah had. It is so awful watching your child go backwards, and it doesn't matter how old that child is.
“It is possible to stop your child or other children dying as a result of [measles], so I hope our experience will serve as a warning to parents. Measles is evil, and it should be vaccinated against.”
Sarah’s story comes amid national concern in the UK over decreased uptake of the measles vaccine, which has fuelled an outbreak in Enfield, with more than 60 cases linked to several schools and a nursery.
SSPE affects 1 in 50,000 cases of natural measles, and according to data from the UK Health Security Agency, since 2009, three children and three adults have died from the condition. It is caused by a mutated measles virus, and typically occurs five to 15 years post-infection, primarily in children.
Sara was born in 1979, and Jo recalls that she was “a bit of a whirlwind”. She said: “She had to do everything at a million miles an hour. She hit all the milestones really early. She was walking by the time she was nine months, and she was rolling across the floor.”
But when she was 11 months old – too young to have had the MMR vaccine that is given to children aged over 12 months – she caught measles after attending nursery, where there were a number of cases circulating. Sarah recovered fully, her mother recalled, and didn’t suffer any acute illness.
For the next two decades, she lived a healthy life and “excelled at everything she did”, including music and sports – she was captain of a hockey team.
Later she studied at St Andrews University in Scotland, and began a midwifery course at Kings College London. However, halfway through the course, at the age of 25, Sarah began to notice stroke-like symptoms, and went to the doctor.
Jo said: “She'd lose words, she'd do buttons up wrong, she'd put the washing machine on without any washing powder in it. One of her legs used to give way on a regular basis, so she'd fall, and she couldn't drink a cup of tea because her hand would suddenly jerk.”
In September 2004, Sarah and her parents received the shocking news that she had SSPE.
Jo said: “I had no idea what SSPE was. [The doctor] explained that it was a very rare, but devastating, complication of the measles virus. He was also very clear that it was not something that you could treat – it was terminal.”
Two months later, in November 2004, Sarah went into hospital after experiencing “massive events of pain”, and her life was never the same again.
“She was walking, she was talking, she was eating. Five weeks later, on 2 December, she came out, she was unable to move, she was unable to speak and she was unable to swallow,” Jo said.
From then onwards her parents took care of her at home with nursing support. She died in her father Mark’s arms on 26 February 2025.
Her mother said: “She deserved her wings. She had fought really hard to stay with us for 20 years, and despite her devastating illness and devastating disabilities, her personality never left her. We miss her every single day and night.”
Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms, followed by a rash a few days later. Some sufferers may also get small spots in their mouths.
The rash starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body. The NHS advises parents to seek advice from 111 or their GP if they think their child might have measles.
The charity Encephalitis International is also running a campaign, called Flames, to help increase public awareness of the symptoms of the condition, which include:
- F – Flu-like symptoms
- L – Loss of consciousness
- A – Acute headache
- M– Memory problems
- E – Emotional or behavioural changes
- S – Seizures

Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon kill 8 Hezbollah members, officials say
Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon kill 8 Hezbollah members, officials say
RAYAK, Lebanon (AP) — Israeli airstrikes on eastern Lebanon have killed eight members of the militant Hezbollah group, including several local officials, two officials with the group said Saturday.
The Lebanese Health Ministry put the death toll at 10, but did not distinguish between militants and civilians.
The Hezbollah officials told The Associated Press that the eight militants were killed in strikes near the village of Rayak in northeast Lebanon late Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media about such details.
An Associated Press team that visited the scene of the strike Saturday morning saw that the top floor of a three-story building was knocked out.
The Israeli military said Saturday that several members of Hezbollah’s missile unit, in three different command centers in the Baalbek area in Lebanon, were “eliminated.”
The Israeli army added that the Hezbollah members killed were identified “as operating to accelerate readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks toward Israel.”
One of the Hezbollah officials said that three of the dead were local commanders and identified them as Ali al-Moussawi, Mohammed al-Moussawi and Hussein Yaghi.
Yaghi was the son of prominent Hezbollah official and one of its founders, Mohammed Yaghi, who died in 2023. Mohammed Yaghi was also a close aide to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September 2024.
Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Saturday that Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon killed 10 people and wounded 24, including three children.
Ali Abdullah, executive director of Rayak Hospital, told the AP that the strike occurred after sunset, adding that they have received 10 bodies and 21 wounded. He added that the dead included two non-Lebanese — a Syrian man and an Ethiopian woman. The wounded included five Syrians and three Ethiopians.
Ethiopians often come to Lebanon as migrant domestic workers.
A funeral was held Saturday afternoon in the eastern village of Nabi Chit for two Hezbollah members who were killed in the strikes.
After the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.
Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024, later reined in but not fully stopped by a U.S.-brokered ceasefire two months later.
Since then, Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and has carried out near-daily strikes in Lebanon that it says target Hezbollah militants and facilities. Hezbollah has claimed one strike against Israel since the ceasefire.
The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of intensified tensions in the region as the United States has threatened to strike Iran — a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas — if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program fail to produce a deal.

Ukraine strikes a key industrial site deep inside Russia
Ukraine strikes a key industrial site deep inside Russia
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian forces struck an industrial site deep inside Russia on Saturday, which Ukraine and unofficial Russian news channels say was a key state-owned missile factory.
The attack in Russia’s Udmurt Republic left 11 people wounded, three of whom were hospitalized, according to a Telegram post by Sergei Bagin, the local health minister.
“One of the republic’s facilities was attacked by drones” launched by Ukraine, regional head Alexander Brechalov said in another Telegram post. He added that the strike caused injuries and damage, but did not identify the site or give further details.
Hours later, Ukraine’s General Staff said its forces struck a key missile plant near the city of Votkinsk, using Ukrainian-made FP-5 “Flamingo” cruise missiles rather than drones.
“A military-industrial complex enterprise, the ‘Votkinsk Plant’ ... was hit. A fire was recorded on the facility’s premises. The results are being clarified,” the General Staff said in a Facebook post.
An unofficial Russian news channel on Telegram, Astra, likewise said earlier on Saturday that the strike targeted the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a major state defense enterprise. Astra said its claim was based on an analysis of footage from residents.
The Votkinsk factory, more than 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from Ukraine, produces Iskander ballistic missiles, often used in strikes against Ukraine, as well as nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, missiles for submarines and air-launched Kinzhal missiles.
Another unofficial Russian Telegram channel, SHOT, which often quotes contacts in the security services, said residents of Votkinsk reported hearing at least three blasts during the night, as well as what they thought was the humming of drones.
The Udmurt Republic’s main passenger airport, in the city of Izhevsk, and airports in nearby regions suspended operations early on Saturday, according to Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsiya.
In other overnight attacks, Ukraine’s General Staff said its forces had also targeted a gas processing plant in Russia’s Samara region. Earlier Saturday, Russian military blogs reported that an attack caused a fire at the Samara plant. There was no immediate comment from Russian officials.
Russia’s Defense Ministry on Saturday said its forces had damaged launching sites for Ukraine’s “Flamingo” cruise missiles over the previous day, among other military targets. The ministry’s statement did not make reference to the Votkinsk missile plant or any Ukrainian strikes in the area.
No progress in peace talks
The strike came days after the latest U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Moscow and Kyiv over Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine ended Wednesday with no sign of a breakthrough, as the war’s fourth anniversary approaches next week.
The negotiations in Switzerland were the third round of direct talks organized by Washington, after meetings earlier this year in Abu Dhabi that officials described as constructive but which also made no major headway. Expectations for significant progress in Geneva were low.
Russia attacked Ukraine with 120 drones and one ballistic missile overnight into Saturday, Ukraine’s air force said. Ukrainian forces shot down 106 drones, while the missile and 13 drones struck targets in 11 locations in the country, the statement said.
Oleh Kiper, the head of Ukraine’s Odesa region on the Black Sea, said drones damaged civilian and energy infrastructure facilities in the region, including a secondary school and an energy company’s warehouses. Two people were also injured, he said in a statement on Telegram.
The southern port city of Odesa and surrounding region have been frequent targets for Russian attacks. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said tens of thousands of Odesa’s residents were left without heating and running water.
In remarks published on social media on Monday evening, Zelenskyy said Moscow should be “held accountable” for the relentless strikes, which he said undermine the U.S. push for peace.
Russia’s FSB says Telegram use endangers front-line troops
Elsewhere, Russia’s Federal Security Service, known by its acronym FSB, claimed that Ukraine has been able to harvest data from Telegram and use it for military purposes. The app is hugely popular among Russians, including soldiers at the front.
The FSB was quoted by Russian state media as saying it had obtained “numerous reliable reports” that the use of Telegram “has repeatedly resulted in threats to the life of service members over the past three months.” The reports did not cite any examples or evidence.
Separately, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a law requiring mobile operators in Russia to block cellular and landline internet services at the request of the FSB, the latest move in the ongoing Kremlin effort to tighten control over the internet.
Earlier this month, Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it will impose new restrictions on Telegram, after accusing it of refusing to observe Russian law. The move triggered widespread criticism from Russian military bloggers, who warned that Telegram was widely used by troops fighting in Ukraine and its throttling would derail military communications.
Last week, Russia attempted to fully block WhatsApp in the country, the company said. Russian authorities have already blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, throttled YouTube, and methodically ramped up restrictions against other popular platforms since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Dozens of countries call for ‘safe, reliable and robust AI’
Dozens of countries, including the United States, China and Switzerland, have called for safe, trustworthy and robust artificial intelligence (AI).
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
They signed a joint declaration published on Saturday at the end of the AI summit in New Delhi.
“Promoting safe, trustworthy and robust AI is essential for building trust and maximising social and economic benefits,” said the text signed by 86 countries and two international organisations.
The text does not contain any concrete commitments, but it does highlight several voluntary and non-binding initiatives, particularly with regard to pooling AI research capabilities at the international level.
+ AI-driven discrimination: protection in Switzerland is weak
“We believe that the potential of AI can be fully realised only when its benefits are shared by all of humanity,” states the declaration published at the end of the five-day summit. It describes the advent of AI as “an inflection point in the trajectory of technological evolution”.
“The commitments made are not completely insignificant; the main thing is that there are commitments, quite simply,” Stuart Russell, a leading computer scientist, told AFP.
“I hope that all countries will be able to build on these agreements […] to develop legally binding commitments to protect their populations, so that the development and deployment of AI can continue without posing unacceptable risks,” Russell continued.
Dozens of delegations
Dozens of delegations from around the world gathered in the Indian capital this week to discuss, among other things, how to regulate this rapidly growing technology.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Swiss President Guy Parmelin, French President Emmanuel Macron, UN Secretary-General António Guterres and leading tech executives, including Sam Altman of Open AI, spoke at the summit, which opened on Thursday.
Among the hot topics were the societal benefits of multilingual AI translation, threats to employment, and the issue of data centre energy consumption.
Two divergent visions
During the debates, two different approaches to managing the development of AI were put forward. Guterres confirmed the launch of a scientific commission aimed at making “human control” of AI “a technical reality”.
Pointing out that the United States and China currently control the vast majority of AI research and investment, Parmelin called for “a monopoly or duopoly to be avoided”. Some large countries have taken the lead. It is essential to restore the balance, he said.
Other countries must organise themselves and create global governance, he stressed, citing India, South Korea, France and Switzerland. On Friday, the United States “totally” rejected any global governance of artificial intelligence, through the voice of Michael Kratsios, White House advisor on science and technology.
At the 2025 edition in Paris, the United States did not sign the declaration. Altman said on Thursday that this rapidly growing technology urgently needs regulation. The next summit will take place next year in Geneva, Parmelin announced.

Slovakia threatens to stop electricity supplies to Ukraine from 23 February
Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has said he will move to stop his country's electricity exports to Ukraine unless Kyiv restores Russian oil transit to Slovakia by Monday 23 February.
Source: Aktuality, a Slovak independent news website; European Pravda
Details: Fico said that unless Ukraine resumes transit of Russian oil to Slovakia by Monday 23 February, which previously flowed via the damaged Druzhba pipeline, he will "instruct the relevant Slovak companies to suspend emergency electricity supplies to Ukraine on the same day".
Quote: "If Zelenskyy thinks that blackmailing Slovakia over oil will bring Ukraine closer to the EU, he is gravely mistaken."
More details: Electricity imports from Slovakia to Ukraine in February 2026 made up about 18% of Ukraine's overall import structure.
Transport of Russian crude oil through the Druzhba pipeline via Ukraine stopped on 27 January following large-scale Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Slovakia and Hungary, after losing this source of imports, declared an emergency in the oil sector and accused Kyiv of refusing to repair the pipeline.
Both countries have already stopped exports of diesel fuel to Ukraine.
Background:
- Hungary has also threatened to stop exports of electricity and gas to Ukraine if Kyiv does not restore operation of the Druzhba pipeline.
- Fico wants to send a monitoring mission to the site of damage to the Druzhba pipeline in the Ukrainian city of Brody to obtain an expert assessment of the damage.

Yemeni political bloc warns unlawful escalation in Aden threatens chances for political resolution
‘Rioting incidents’ took place in interim capital Aden a day after newly formed government convened its 1st meeting there
ISTANBUL
A Yemeni political bloc warned that any escalation outside the framework of the law in the interim capital Aden in the south of the country threatens prospects for the political solutions needed to end the crisis, according to Yemen’s official Saba News Agency.
The statement was issued by the national bloc of political parties and signed by 22 parties and political components, the news agency reported late Friday.
The bloc expressed regret over the “rioting incidents” that took place in Aden on Thursday evening, which led to injuries and caused panic among citizens and children in nearby civilian facilities.
It stressed that “the right to peaceful expression is constitutionally guaranteed,” emphasizing that any escalation outside the law does not serve Aden or its residents’ causes, but rather “threatens the political remedies required at this sensitive stage.”
It also expressed appreciation for what it described as Saudi Arabia’s “generous support” aimed at normalizing conditions, enhancing services, and alleviating the hardships Aden has endured in recent years.
The bloc condemned the role of “parties” — without naming them — behind hostile acts against state institutions, accusing them of attempting to undermine recent improvements and drag Aden back into chaos in a manner that serves only opponents of stability.
It said the only safe path to addressing outstanding issues, foremost among them the southern issue, is “comprehensive southern–southern dialogue, away from chaos and illegitimate pressure tools.”
Among the signatories were the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Congregation for Reform, the Yemeni Socialist Party, the Nasserist Unionist People's Organization, and the Al-Rashad Union.
Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council said Friday that people were killed and injured following unrest it described as attempts to target state institutions in Aden, a day after the newly formed government convened its first meeting there.
Aden’s security committee said armed groups had gathered near the Al-Maashiq Presidential Palace and attempted to storm it, while also confronting security forces.
According to the presidential source, security forces responded to the escalation with “maximum restraint,” dispersing gatherings that sought to block roads and disrupt public order, while “safeguarding sovereign facilities in line with the law.”
On Feb. 6, the Presidential Leadership Council announced the formation of a new government headed by Shaya al-Zindani, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio.
The Cabinet followed weeks of consultations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, aimed at easing tensions between the internationally recognized government and the Southern Transitional Council, and reaching a consensual framework for the next phase.

US military airlifts small reactor as Trump pushes to quickly deploy nuclear power
The Pentagon and the Energy Department have airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is potential for the U.S. to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use
- Bookmark
The Pentagon and the Energy Department for the first time airlifted a small nuclear reactor from California to Utah, demonstrating what they say is U.S. potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.
The nearly 700-mile flight last weekend — which transported a 5-megawatt microreactor without nuclear fuel — highlights the Trump administration’s drive to promote nuclear energy to help meet skyrocketing demand for power from artificial intelligence and data centers, as well for use by the military.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense Michael Duffey, who traveled with the privately built reactor, hailed the Feb. 15 trip on a C-17 military aircraft as a breakthrough for U.S. efforts to fast-track commercial licensing for the microreactors, part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reshape the country's energy landscape.
A new emphasis on nuclear energy
President Donald Trump supports nuclear power — a carbon-free source of electricity — as a reliable energy source, even as he has been broadly hostile to renewable energy and prioritizes coal and other fossil fuels to produce electricity.
Skeptics warn that nuclear energy poses risks and say microreactors may not be safe or feasible and have not proved they can meet demand for a reasonable price.
Wright brushed those concerns aside as he touted progress on Trump’s push for a quick escalation of nuclear power. Trump signed a series of executive orders last year that allow Wright to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.
“Today is history. A multi-megawatt, next-generation nuclear power plant is loaded in the C-17 behind us,” Wright said before the two-hour flight from March Air Reserve Base in California to Hill Air Force base in Utah.
The minivan-sized reactor transported by the military is one of at least three that will reach “criticality” — when a nuclear reaction can sustain an ongoing series of reactions — by July 4, as Trump has promised, Wright said.
“That’s speed, that’s innovation, that’s the start of a nuclear renaissance,” he said.
Microreactors would be for civilian and military use
Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S. that generate about 19% of the country’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That's down from 104 reactors in 2013 and includes two new commercial reactors in Georgia that were the nation's first large reactors built from scratch in a generation.
Recognizing delays inherent to deployment of new, full-scale reactors, the industry and government have focused in recent years on more efficient designs, including a small modular reactor proposed by the nation’s largest public power company, the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Microreactors, designed to be portable, can take that a step further and "accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it’s needed,” Duffey said. Eventually, the mobile reactors could provide energy security on a military base without the civilian grid, he and other officials said.
The demonstration flight “gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.
The reactor transported to Utah will be able to generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, said Isaiah Taylor, CEO of Valar Atomics, the California startup that produced the reactor. The company hopes to start selling power on a test basis next year and become fully commercial in 2028.
Some safety concerns haven't been addressed, experts say
Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the transport flight — which included a throng of reporters, photographers and TV news crews — was little more than “a dog-and-pony show” that merely demonstrated the Pentagon's ability to ship a piece of heavy equipment.
The flight “doesn't answer any questions about whether the project is feasible, economic, workable or safe — for the military and the public,” Lyman said in an interview.
The Trump administration “hasn't made the safety case” for how microreactors, once loaded with nuclear fuel, can be transported securely to data centers or military bases, Lyman said.
Officials also have not resolved how nuclear waste will be disposed, although Wright said the Energy Department is in talks with Utah and other states to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal.
The microreactor flown to Utah will be sent to the Utah San Rafael Energy Lab for testing and evaluation, Wright said. Fuel will be provided by the Nevada National Security site, Taylor said.
“The answer to energy is always more,” Wright said. After four years of restrictions on more polluting forms of energy under the Biden administration, he said, "now we’re trying to set everything free. And nuclear will be flying soon.”

"I Put Him There": Trump claims credit for installing Syria’s president al-Sharaa

ALBAWABA - US President Donald Trump caused a stir when he said he was "practically responsible" for the rise of Ahmed al-Sharaa, Syria's transitional president, and praised him for doing a "exceptional job" in office.
Critics of Trump's comments say they show that the U.S. has direct control over Syria's leadership during its unstable transition from Assad. This sparked a lot of debate online and in political circles. Supporters, on the other hand, saw the statement as a sign that Washington was once again getting involved in diplomacy in the area.
After the Assad government fell, Al-Sharaa took over as leader and has been in charge of a transitional period that is meant to bring stability to the country after years of civil war. His presidency was the result of a larger effort in the region and around the world to coordinate the next stage of governance in Damascus.
Hakan Fidan, the Turkish Foreign Minister, said earlier that there were a number of meetings in the region and around the world after Assad left the country. The talks, which are said to have started in Amman, moved to Cairo, and later included representatives from Europe and the US, were mostly about how to shape Syria's transitional roadmap. Fidan says that the countries that took part told al-Sharaa what they wanted, and al-Sharaa said he was willing to work with the priorities of the region.
Fidan also said that regional players, like Turkey, made it clear that they would only continue to support al-Sharaa if he kept his political and security promises.
Trump's comments come at a time when Syria's geopolitical alliances are changing. International powers are still heavily involved in rebuilding, making security arrangements, and restructuring the government. The White House hasn't said anything more about the president's comments, but they have made the U.S.–Syria relationship even more sensitive.
The debate over external influence and sovereignty is still very important in both domestic and international discussions as Syria goes through a difficult transition.

Dozens of tigers die as virus hits Thai tourist attractions
- Thailand is facing a severe disease outbreak that has killed at least 72 captive tigers at wildlife parks in the northern province of Chiang Mai.
- The majority of deaths, totalling 72, occurred between 8 and 19 February at Tiger Kingdom Mae Taeng and Tiger Kingdom Mae Rim, major tourist attractions where holidaymakers can touch and have photos taken with the felines.
- Preliminary tests by livestock officials confirmed feline parvovirus as the primary infection, with canine distemper virus and Mycoplasma bacteria also detected in the deceased tigers.
- Authorities have temporarily closed Tiger Kingdom Mae Rim, restricted access to both facilities, and are disinfecting enclosures while relocating surviving tigers for monitoring and vaccination.
- Officials suggest that inbreeding among captive tigers may have weakened their immune systems, making them more susceptible to the highly contagious and often fatal diseases.

Libya PM undergoes 'successful' treatment at heart hospital
Libya's Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah has undergone "successful" treatment at a heart hospital, his office said Saturday, but his specific ailment was not disclosed.
"I assure you that I am fine, by God's grace," said a statement posted on social media overnight.
The treatment was carried out at a facility in the northwestern Libyan city of Misrata on an undisclosed date.
Dbeibah said he later travelled abroad for "additional medical checkups for reassurance", though this was not the primary reason for his trip.
Italian media outlets previously reported he had been admitted to a leading cardiac facility in Milan on Thursday for a general check-up.
"The matter is simply that I underwent some additional medical checkups for reassurance while I was abroad due to a prior external commitment," he said.
"The results confirmed the success of the treatment I received in Libya, praise be to God."
The prime minister leads a UN-recognised government based in Tripoli that controls western Libya, while the country's east is run by another administration backed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar.
Libya has remained divided since chaos erupted following the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that toppled longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi.

Poroshenko announces transfer of 15 Ai-Petri complexes for defense of Kyiv
MP, leader of the European Solidarity party Petro Poroshenko transferred seven Ai-Petri complexes for countering hostile intelligence to units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and announced that in the coming days another 15 complexes will be delivered to the defenders of Kyiv.
"Today we are finally beginning the transfer of Ai-Petri systems this year. Seven units worth a total of UAH 60 million are heading to the military. From now on, they will operate under the combat command of the 421st Separate Battalion and one of the centers carrying out counter-reconnaissance operations ... Fifteen Ai-Petri systems will soon be protecting critical infrastructure in Kyiv. We plan to transfer them by the end of the month to units covering the sky over the capital," Poroshenko wrote on Facebook.
He noted that the high-tech Ai-Petri systems are manufactured using Ukrainian-made components and can operate against both reconnaissance drones and strike drones such as Shaheds, adding that they have "already made quite a name for themselves at the front due to their effectiveness." "They are currently providing cover for artillery brigades, ammunition supply operations and the evacuation of wounded from the battlefield," Poroshenko said.
According to the party’s website, Poroshenko has invested more than UAH 200 million in the production of Ai-Petri SV systems since autumn 2023. The systems have successfully passed testing and are in use by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In March 2025, Poroshenko announced a contract with the Ministry of Defense. In total, since the project’s launch, the military has received more than 250 units.
Each system consists of a counter-reconnaissance unit, a pickup truck, a charging station, a generator and necessary electronics.

Is China’s Xi set to host a weakened Trump after US Supreme Court tariffs setback?
The big question is whether a weaker hand for US president at coming Beijing summit will give any advantage to China
They said the court’s decision could weaken Trump’s negotiating position with Chinese President Xi Jinping, while potentially offering short-term good news for US-linked exporters in China.
Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, said “the ruling of the Supreme Court weakened, of course, Trump’s trade leverage vis-a-vis the Chinese side”.
However, he stressed that this did not automatically translate into greater Chinese advantage at the coming summit. Given Trump’s transactional approach, Beijing would need both the capacity and willingness to make some concessions that Trump could present as a “success story”, Shi said.

Labour minister claims Green policy would unleash ‘drugs epidemic’ across UK
- Policing Minister Sarah Jones has warned that the Green Party's drug policy could turn playgrounds into "crack dens" and unleash a "drugs epidemic" across Britain.
- Green Party leader Zack Polanski defended their proposal for a "public health approach" to drug-taking, advocating for a regulated market to curb criminal supply and reduce harm.
- Mr Polanski argued that the "war on drugs is failing" and criticised Labour for playing "political games" with people's lives, urging them to adopt an evidence-based approach.
- The debate intensified ahead of a by-election in Greater Manchester, where Green Party candidate Hannah Spencer has previously supported drug decriminalisation.
- Labour claims the Green Party's proposals could lead to a doubling of drug deaths and increased public drug use, referencing Oregon's experience where overdose deaths rose after decriminalisation.

President Donald Trump could consider allowing Iran to conduct uranium enrichment at a symbolic level as part of a “token” nuclear agreement provided it leaves no possible path to a nuclear weapon, U.S. media reported Friday, citing senior officials.
The news comes as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran is finalizing a proposal expected to be shared with Washington within days. He said the plan would include political commitments and technical measures to ensure the program is exclusively civilian.
According to a report by website Axios, Washington's official position remains "zero enrichment" on Iranian soil. However, a senior official said the administration would review a proposal that includes small, symbolic, or "token" enrichment if Iran offers detailed guarantees.
"President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home," the official said, adding that any proposal must be detailed and demonstrate that Iran's nuclear program would be peaceful.
Axios also reported that Trump has been presented with military options, including scenarios targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his son Mojtaba, who is seen as a potential successor, and other senior clerics. A second source confirmed that a plan to kill Khamenei and his son was presented to Trump several weeks ago.
Sources told the outlet that no final decision has been made.
A senior White House official said any Iranian proposal must be "very detailed" and prove the nuclear program would be "benign," adding that Washington would evaluate the offer once it is submitted in writing.
The news follows warnings by Trump that U.S. military action against Iran might be imminent, amid a buildup of U.S. forces in the region.

What Reform UK’s senior figures really think about women and families
As Reform UK surges in the polls and attempts to get its top team ready to fight an election, The Independent has taken a look at exactly what key figures in the party have said about marriage, women, abortion and fertility – and what it might mean for policy

Reform UK has a chequered history when it comes to women and families, with some of the party’s more prominent figures having faced criticism for their views.
Matt Goodwin, the party’s candidate in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election, has previously called for young girls to be given a “biological reality” check, as well as suggesting people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment, while the party’s new head of policy, Dr James Orr, has previously argued that marriage is best for children when it is between a man and a woman.
Nigel Farage himself has also faced criticism for his comments about women, last year suggesting that men are prepared to sacrifice family lives for successful careers in a way many women aren't.
As the party surges in the polls and attempts to get its top team ready to fight an election, The Independent has taken a look at exactly what key figures in the party have said about marriage, women, abortion and fertility – and what it might mean for policy.
Marriage
In 2025, Mr Farage was accused of “vile homophobia” for claiming straight couples are more stable than gay relationships during a press conference welcoming former Conservative MP Danny Kruger to Reform UK.
Mr Farage, who has twice been married and is now in a relationship, said “the most stable relationships tend to be between men and women” after he was asked about past comments made by the right-winger, who became the first sitting Tory MP to join Mr Farage’s party.
Mr Kruger, who defected to Reform from the Tories last year, previously told a National Conservatism conference that marriage between men and women was “the only basis for a safe and successful society”.
This is a view that has been echoed by the party’s new head of policy.
Speaking to the Family Education’s Trust’s 2025 Annual Conference, Dr Orr said: “All the data shows that the children are better off, are best off with a mum and a dad, preferably in the house, preferably biologically related to them. It's a difficult piece of data to put forward in our permissive age, but it's true.”
Describing families which are made up of a heterosexual couple with children as “natural”, he added: “There needs to be some kind of normative ideal, there needs to be some benchmark that we can at least aspire to… that the state, to some extent, can help families aspire to.”
Abortion
Nigel Farage has previously taken aim at UK abortion laws, saying they are “totally out of date”, arguing it is “ludicrous we allow abortion up to 24 weeks”.
Mr Kruger, the Reform MP for East Wiltshire, in a debate on abortion once disagreed that pregnant women had an “absolute right to bodily autonomy”, sparking protests in his constituency.
He later clarified that he does “not wish to dictate what a woman should do with her own body, as has been claimed”, adding that his position on abortion "reflects the status quo" and that he supported the 1967 Abortion Act.
It came as MPs voted to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales, reforms which were designed to protect women while maintaining penalties for medical professionals and abusive partners who terminate a pregnancy outside the current legal framework.
A Reform spokesperson last year said the party does not have a stance on abortion and has no intention of making changes to the current abortion laws.
However, the party’s new head of policy has described Britain’s abortion laws as “extreme”.
“Two or three days ago, I think, there was an interview on Times Radio with a medic arguing that – even though Britain has one of the most extreme abortion regimes in the world, 24 weeks, we’re up there with North Korea, China and, God help us, Canada – this wasn’t extreme enough, that we should be pushing for 37 weeks, 38 weeks,” Dr Orr told Family Education Trust’s 2025 annual conference.
Fertility and birth rates
Earlier this month, The Independent revealed that Reform UK’s candidate in an upcoming by-election, Matt Goodwin, previously called for women and young girls to be given a “biological reality” check, as he gave his views on how Britain should tackle its impending “fertility crisis”.
Days earlier, it was revealed that Dr Goodwin previously suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment. The unearthed clip posted to his personal YouTube channel in November 2024 showed the former academic warning that “many women in Britain are having children much too late in life”.
While Nigel Farage later poured cold water on the proposal to tax people without children, saying the party has no plans to hike taxes, he said those who have “quite a few children” could be given tax breaks to help with the cost of living if his party came to power.
Dr Orr has also advocated for pro-natalist public policy, saying that the “gap between desired fertility and actual fertility was getting wider and wider in most parts of the West”.
While he said this is “not about coercing women into making choices that they don’t want to have”, he added that it is “perfectly legitimate for social conservatives, for all of us, to ask why and what can be done” to make it easier to “bring new life into the world”.
But in spite of these comments about the declining birth rate, Reform UK earlier this year U-turned on a promise to lift the two-child benefit cap, which penalises families which have more than two children.
Mr Farage vowed to axe the cap in May last year, saying it was the “right thing to do”, before later clarifying it should be lifted only for British families in work.
But Robert Jenrick, Reform UK’s new Treasury spokesman, said on Wednesday that the policy “has to go”, calling for the cap to be kept, as Mr Farage admitted his “attempt at being pro-family has failed”.
Women in the workplace
The most concrete policy Reform has unveiled relating to women and families so far is their plan to scrap the Equality Act, announced by Suella Braverman, Reform’s new education and equalities spokesperson.
But the announcement has sparked concerns that it could negatively impact women, given its role in protecting maternity leave and discrimination against mothers and pregnant women.
In the wake of the announcement, the Good Law Project accused Reform UK of “pitching for the votes of misogynists, homophobes, racists and antisemites, who are the only people who benefit from removing discrimination protections”.
And in 2025, Mr Farage risked triggering a row over sexism after he told a Westminster lunch that more men “are prepared to sacrifice their family lives in order to pursue a career and be successful in a way that fewer women are.”
“And those women that do have probably got more chance of reaching the top than the blokes,” he added.

Botswana’s diamond-funded health system has failed: it needs to be reformed and rebuilt | Duma Gideon Boko

Shortages of medicine in Botswana forced me to declare a public health emergency last year. Patients went without treatment – not because health workers failed them, but because the system did. For a nation committed to universal healthcare, free at the point of use, it was a moment of hard truth.
Even outwardly strong public health systems can be fragile. As donor assistance bites across the continent, governments cannot afford to delay building resilience.
As a stable, middle-income country, Botswana was only ever a peripheral recipient of aid. Yet when diamond revenues – the country’s primary export – fell amid a market downturn, the fiscal shock was no different in effect.
For many, the conclusion was simple: less revenue leads to worse health outcomes.
The reality is more nuanced. Diamond revenues enabled Botswana to build a universal public health system. Even in one of the world’s most sparsely populated countries, most people in Botswana are rarely more than five kilometres away from a clinic.
Yet the same diamond revenues that built our system also masked its weaknesses. Problems were paid away rather than fixed. Drug prices were inflated many times over. Supply chains were inefficient. Public capacity was hollowed out through outsourcing. These failures did not suddenly appear but accumulated over the years.
Falling revenues simply made them impossible to ignore. When healthcare systems face a moment of reckoning, the same prescription is reliably offered: inject more “private-sector rigour” into inefficient public health delivery. But greater reliance on private provision fragments care, raises costs and diverts scarce health budgets into profit margins.
Private providers have an important role to play. Still, where care can be delivered at cost within a strong public system, it is simply more affordable – and more sustainable – than outsourcing it.
Moreover, when healthcare is outsourced, accountability becomes blurred. But when shortages hit, it is the government that people turn to. Democratic responsibility cannot be subcontracted.
Botswana is expanding public capacity. We are bringing our largest private hospital into public ownership to relieve pressure on overstretched facilities.
We are restructuring the national medicines procurement body, making it autonomous to cut bureaucratic delays. A national health intelligence centre will soon be operational, using real-time data to forecast medicine demand and prevent shortages. And once the health insurance bill passes parliament, health funding will be ringfenced – ending our exposure to swings in commodity markets.
Together, these reforms will determine whether a mother can find antibiotics for her child, or whether a patient needing dialysis must travel huge distances for care.
But no country of two-and-a-half million people can fully secure its medicine supply alone. Africa must ultimately produce more of the treatments its people rely on. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings 55 countries into a single market, offers a chance to do what Europe and Asia did decades ago: build regional pharmaceutical industries designed to serve public health first.
Pharmaceutical manufacturing needs scale and predictable demand. AfCFTA provides both, turning fragmented national markets into a regional economy large enough to draw investment. It also creates the conditions for governments to use African suppliers in public procurement, turning health budgets into a driver of industrial development.
AfCFTA has been largely ratified, yet implementation remains uneven. Now governments must give it force through their laws, their institutions and their choices.
Ambition for the continent only works when governments take responsibility at home.
Resilience is not created by spending alone; it is built through public capacity, which only governments can sustain. Botswana has learned this through crisis. Diamond revenues built our healthcare system; dependence on them weakened it. Shock exposed the cracks. Now reform must rebuild it.

‘Reimagining matter’: Nobel laureate invents machine that harvests water from dry air

A Nobel laureate’s environmentally friendly invention that provides clean water if central supplies are knocked out by a hurricane or drought could be a life saver for vulnerable islands, its founder says.
The invention, by the chemist Prof Omar Yaghi, uses a type of science called reticular chemistry to create molecularly engineered materials, which can extract moisture from the air and harvest water even in arid and desert conditions.
Atoco, a technology company that Yaghi founded, said its units, comparable in size to a 20ft shipping container and powered entirely by ultra-low-grade thermal energy, could be placed in local communities to generate up to 1,000 litres of clean water every day, even if centralised electricity and water sources are interrupted by drought or storm damage.
Yaghi, who won the 2025 Nobel prize award in chemistry, said the invention would change the world and benefit islands in the Caribbean, which are prone to drought. He added that it could be a solution for countries needing to get water to marooned communities after hurricanes such as Beryl and Melissa, which left thousands without water.
“Hurricanes such as Melissa or Beryl unleashed heavy flooding, destroying homes and crops and impacting thousands of lives in the Caribbean. This devastation is a stark reminder of the urgent need for enhanced water supply resilience in vulnerable areas, particularly small island nations susceptible to extreme weather events,” Yaghi said.
The invention, Yaghi added, could provide a climate-friendly and sustainable alternative to other water sourcing options such as desalination, which may pose a threat to ecosystems when concentrated salty brine is released back into the ocean.
Last month, a UN report said the planet had entered a “global water bankruptcy era” with nearly three-quarters of the world’s population living in countries classified as water-insecure or critically water insecure.
“Around 2.2 billion people still lack safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion lack safely managed sanitation and about 4 billion experience severe water scarcity for at least one month a year,” the report said.
In the three-island Caribbean nation of Grenada, which was devastated by Hurricane Beryl in 2024, Yaghi’s invention offers a ray of hope, particularly for Carriacou and Petite Martinique that bore the brunt of the disaster and face a triple threat of storms, drought and coastal erosion.
“The technology’s ability to function off-grid using only ambient energy is particularly compelling for our context,” said the Carriacou government official and environmentalist Davon Baker.
Carriacou and Petite Martinique, which are still experiencing the after-effects of Beryl, are forced to import water from Grenada to deal with dry seasons that appear to be getting more intense and longer every year.
“We’re currently considering comprehensive recovery and resilience strategies, and the atmospheric water-harvesting technology Prof Yaghi developed addresses several critical challenges we face: the high cost and carbon intensity, as well as the contamination risk, of water importation; vulnerability of centralised systems to hurricane damage; and the need for decentralised solutions that can operate when traditional infrastructure fails,” Baker said.
Yaghi, who grew up in a refugee community in Jordan, said he was inspired by the hardships he endured in a home with no running water or electricity. Giving his Nobel prize banquet speech, he recalled water arriving to his desert community from the government once every week or two.
“I remember the whisper through our neighbourhood, ‘the water is coming’, and the urgency as I rushed to fill every container I could find before the flow stopped.”
Describing the invention as “a science capable of reimagining matter” he urged leaders to “remove barriers, protect academic freedom” and “welcome global talent”.
“On climate, the hour for collective action has already arrived. The science is here. What we need now is courage – courage scaled to the enormity of the task – so we may gift the next generation not only carbon capture, but a planet worthy of their hopes,” he said.

CBS News is convulsing as Larry Ellison tries to please Trump | Margaret Sullivan

Anderson Cooper decides to walk away from broadcast TV’s most prestigious news show, 60 Minutes. Stephen Colbert takes his interview with a rising Democratic politician to YouTube instead of his own late-night show. The CBS Evening News anchor presents a misleading version of the network’s own exclusive reporting on Ice arrests. And a news producer writes a farewell note to her CBS News colleagues blaming the loss of editorial independence.
If you connect the dots, the picture of what’s happening at CBS becomes all too clear. That picture comes into even sharper focus once you recall an underlying factor: the network’s parent company is trying to get a big commercial deal done and needs the help of the Trump administration to bring it over the finish line.
“Media capture” is the name that University of Pennsylvania scholar Victor Pickard gives to what we’re seeing unfold before our eyes.
What’s happening at CBS and elsewhere “isn’t a singular breakdown”, Pickard writes in a new analysis.
It’s a whole cascade of layers – media ownership, control and market structure – that “endanger our information and communication systems, our First Amendment freedoms, and our democracy”.
In the CBS situation, the immediate motivation is easy to understand. The network’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, wants to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, which also owns CNN – one of Donald Trump’s favorite punching bags and a news organization he would love to see take the same rightward turn as CBS.
Paramount Skydance is run by David Ellison, son of Larry Ellison, the Trump pal and one of the richest people on earth. Their effort is somewhat against the odds, since Warner Brothers Discovery’s board favors a competing offer from Netflix.
But the Ellisons haven’t given up, and they have some powerful friends in their corner, since any deal may need FCC approval. The Trump-appointed chairperson of the FCC, Brendan Carr, has shown himself to be a political animal, not the impartial and public-spirited leader that this crucial role calls for.
So much of what’s happened at CBS – the back-of-the-hand treatment of Colbert and the rightward drift of the news division – are ways of signalling that the Ellisons are more than willing to serve Trump’s interests.
If Paramount Skydance does end up controlling CNN, Cooper – one of the cable network’s most prominent faces – may find that trouble is following him. (Publicly, Cooper, who has had an unusual arrangement working for both CNN and 60 Minutes, says he wants to spend more time with his children; but he’s also reportedly unhappy with the direction of the show under CBS News editor Bari Weiss, who reports directly to David Ellison.)
As for Colbert, he has made no secret of where he stands, not just this last week when his interview with a Democratic Texas lawmaker ran into internal network roadblocks.
Months ago, after CBS settled a frivolous lawsuit brought by Trump last year, Colbert – on air – labeled the settlement a “big, fat bribe”. Soon after, the network decided not to offer him another contract.
It’s all a vivid example of a worrisome problem in American media. As media companies become more consolidated, and ever more in the hands of the richest Americans, priorities change radically. Editorial independence weakens; self-censorship grows.
The dominoes of capitulation seem to tumble voluntarily.
“The government doesn’t have to formally censor anyone,” wrote Parker Molloy on her newsletter, The Present Age. “It just has to make enough threats that corporations start censoring themselves.”
No surprise then that, in presenting CBS News research about immigrants arrested by ICE, the network’s evening news anchor, Tony Dokoupil, earlier this month inverted the original reporting to emphasize the crimes – not that so few of the crimes are violent. After all, that would have been contrary to how Trump has portrayed ICE-arrested immigrants as rapists and murderers. (DUIs, or driving under the influence, the reporting showed, far outpaced homicides and sexual assaults.)
And no surprise that, in leaving the network, journalist Alicia Hastey lamented that stories increasingly are “evaluated not just on their journalistic merits but on whether they conform to a shifting set of ideological expectations”.
I’ve heard fascism described as the dangerous combination of state power and corporate power. And here we are.
With a politicized FCC, a self-interested president surrounded by soulless lackeys, and corporate media bosses trying to protect commercial interests, we’re far down that road.
To pull it back means serious policy reform. For starters, that would mean strict limits on media consolidation, support for independent local journalism, and a truly nonpartisan FCC.
At the moment that’s highly unlikely, since such reform must be driven by those who understand that journalism is meant to serve the public – not to help the rich and powerful buy their next yachts.

This Ramadan in Gaza we pray for mercy, share what we have and light a single candle for hope | Majdoleen Abu Assi

Every year, Ramadan comes as a sanctuary for the soul. For Muslims like me, it is a sacred pause in the chaos of life. But this year, as a woman displaced from the familiar streets of Gaza City to a rented room in Al-Zawayda, I am searching for a peace that feels like a ghost. The world calls this a “ceasefire”, yet from my window the silence feels heavy. We are holding our breath because the fear of death has not disappeared, it has just become unpredictable.
I did not welcome Ramadan this year with the golden lanterns that once adorned our balconies. I welcomed it to the roar of bulldozers clearing the bones of neighbouring houses and with the constant buzz of the zanana, the Israeli surveillance drones, overhead. Even as we stand in prayer, that metallic humming drowns out the adhan, the call to prayer, reminding us that we are still watched and that our “calm” rests at the mercy of a sudden strike.
My heart remains in the ruins of Gaza City. I mourn the vibrant life of Al-Zawiya market, the scent of its spices, and the al-Omari mosque, where our collective prayers once felt like an unbreakable fortress. Ramadan used to mean true warmth to me. I experienced it at my family home in Gaza, in the Rimal neighborhood, where the table brought us together, filled with laughter and peace. Sometimes I would break my fast with my family, sometimes with friends or neighbours, as if the month were teaching us that the heart had room for everyone.
Today, we stand in cramped rooms, our ears tilted toward the sky. We pray for mercy and listen for the whistle of a missile that may decide our “truce” has expired. Displacement has turned every ritual into a mountain to climb. The cost of food and drink for the entire month of Ramadan used to be no more than 1,000 shekels, while today it is easily 3,500 shekels without even fully meeting basic needs.
As I walk home from work just before sunset, I move through rubble and sand that fill the air and sting the eyes. The road I take is a winding path between collapsed buildings and deep craters. At that hour, my thoughts are simple: what can I prepare for iftar, when we break our fast, from so little? Ramadan evenings once meant anticipation – choosing where to break our fast, stepping into spaces filled with light and laughter. Now, I calculate portions of lentils and count what remains in the cupboard, trying to create something that still feels like home.
Even through this grief and exhaustion, I see a defiant and beautiful hope. In Al-Zawayda, neighbours share their small portions of lentils or dates with dignity that rises above hunger. This solidarity is our sacred resistance. It is our way of declaring that even if our homes are destroyed, the human spirit within us will not be crushed. We light a single candle, not because it will keep the darkness away, but because the act of lighting it is itself a victory over despair.
Ramadan for the children is the hardest part. They have learned the language of war, and can hear the difference between a shell and an explosion, even before they have learned the songs of Ramadan. When they ask “Will the bombing return tomorrow?” they are really asking if they have a future. Something we can’t answer – for them or ourselves. Yet when I see them hanging a torn decoration on the side of a tent, I understand something essential: in Gaza, hope is not a feeling. It is a decision.
Please understand, while you at home may hear that it is quiet here – with fewer stories in the news about us and a fragile “ceasefire” reported – quiet is not peace. Real peace is the right to the ordinary. To walk to a market that still exists and hasn’t been turned to rubble, to pray in a mosque that has not been desecrated, to go home to a neighbourhood that hasn’t been flattened, to sleep without wondering whether silence is merely the prelude to another nightmare.
This Ramadan in Gaza comes with a different spirit. As the adhan sounds tonight, I feel a flicker of tranquility. Not because the world is just or we can see an end to our suffering, but because we are still here, weaving hope from threads of ruin. We fast, we pray and we remain – not out of habit, but as an act of reclaiming our souls from the wreckage.

Donor suspended from Tories pays £50,000 for dinner with Kemi Badenoch

A Conservative donor who was suspended from the party after being accused of bullying and inappropriate language spent £50,000 last week to have dinner with Kemi Badenoch, the Guardian has learned.
Rami Ranger was the successful bidder for the dinner at a Tory fundraising event and will attend the meal with a small group of friends, infuriating those in the party who believe he should not have been readmitted.
Lord Ranger, who has given more than £1.5m to the Conservatives since 2009, was suspended in 2023 after complaints about remarks he had made to an independent journalist, and separately, about Pakistanis. He was readmitted in November 2024, but lost his CBE soon afterwards.
He told the Guardian he was suspended from the party because he had refused to apologise to the complainants. “I have been a member of the Conservative party since 1978, inspired by Edward Heath,” he said. “My support, financial and otherwise, has always been grounded in belief in free trade, enterprise, limited bureaucracy, and Britain’s competitiveness as a trading nation.”
Another party backer, however, said: “The rehabilitation of Rami Ranger just shows how desperate this Tory party is for money from anywhere.”
The Conservative party has been approached for comment.
Ranger made his successful bid during a 1920s-themed event at the five-star Peninsula hotel in central London. Tables for the fundraising party cost as much as £10,000 each, giving Tory backers the chance to bid for lots including dinner with Michael Gove, lunch with Jacob Rees-Mogg and a shooting trip with the shadow housing secretary, James Cleverly.
The event reportedly raised around £220,000 for the party. A lunch with the shadow energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, sold for £10,000 and a round of golf with David Cameron for a rate of £2,000 a hole.
The most popular lot, however, was the dinner with Badenoch, which attracted bids from a number of senior donors, according to attendees.
Ranger’s invitation to the event and his successful bid show how far the party has shifted in its attitude towards him in the last few years. The Guardian revealed in 2022 that Ranger was under investigation by the House of Lords after being accused of bullying and harassing the freelance journalist Poonam Joshi.
In a series of tweets, Ranger made an unfounded allegation that Joshi’s husband was a domestic abuser, called her an “evil woman”, a “total disgrace” and the “epitome of filth and garbage”. He threatened to take her to court, warning: “I will teach you a lesson.”
Joshi criticised the revelation about the Tories reintergrating and accepting money from Ranger again, calling it “appalling and totally unethical”.
The Lords commissioner for standards ruled he had abused his power by “persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating Ms Joshi”, but decided not to suspend Ranger from parliament after he promised to undertake social media training and re-attend a seminar on the parliamentary behaviour code.
As the investigation was taking place, Ranger wrote a letter to the BBC in which he demanded to know “if your Pakistani-origin staff” had been involved in a documentary critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.
He later apologised and withdrew the comments, saying they were “by no means a reflection of how I see the British Pakistani community”, but he was suspended from the party in September 2023 after an internal investigation.
Party officials did not announce his suspension, and quietly reinstated him in late 2024, updating the official parliamentary register to show he had previously been suspended.
Soon after he was reinstated, Ranger was stripped of his CBE, a move he said at the time had devastated him. Electoral Commission records show he gave £5,000 to the party in early 2024 during his suspension, but that he has not donated since.

‘We can see that courage’: Greece recovers long-lost photos of Nazis’ May Day executions

In his book-filled office, Vangelis Sakkatos took in the images of the men lined up before a firing squad. The executions on May Day 1944 have haunted him since he was a boy.
“Their heroism was the stuff of myth,” said the veteran leftist, casting his eyes over the photographs that have dominated Greece’s press in recent days with a mixture of fury and awe. “The years may have passed, but I haven’t forgotten.”
At 96, Sakkatos never imagined the time would come when he would be able to “put a face” to the protagonists of a tragedy that would go down as one of the worst atrocities of Nazi occupation. The 200 communists, executed by machine gun fire in the Kaisariani shooting range, barely a mile away from his first-floor flat, were killed in retaliation for the fatal attack on a German general ambushed by communist guerrillas a few days earlier.
The pictures depict the men walking into the firing range in Athens, their heads held high as they stare, seemingly unafraid, into the camera. Famously, they went to their deaths chanting partisan songs in a final act of resistance.
“That is what we have always heard,” said Sakkatos, who for years lobbied with other leftists for a monument to be erected in their honour. “And now we can see that courage before our eyes.”
Until last week, when the photographs were posted on eBay by Tim de Craene, a Belgian collector specialising in Third Reich memorabilia, it was not known whether the images existed.
In the absence of pictorial evidence, testimony of the communists’ last moments rested on the handwritten notes the men had thrown out of trucks as they were driven to their deaths from Block 15, the notorious camp in Chaidari, on the western fringes of the Greek capital, where political prisoners were detained.
On Friday, after days of outcry in the wake of the pictures’ emergence, the Greek culture ministry said it had signed a preliminary agreement with De Craene to buy the photos and he had withdrawn them from sale.
The prints, believed to have been taken by Hermann Heuer, a Wehrmacht lieutenant, amounted to “a monument of exceptional historical importance”, it said.
Few events in the collective memory of a nation that endured more than three years of German occupation have held such sway. The May Day executions – seen as the high point of the country’s communist-led anti-Nazi resistance – would inspire some of the country’s greatest contemporary artists. Poets, songwriters, painters and film-makers have all drawn on an episode that ever since has gripped the popular imagination.
“It’s one thing to hear about their bravery and quite another to see it,” said Yiannis Eris, a communist party volunteer who gives guided tours of the firing range and national resistance museum in Kaisariani. “Now we know they faced the firing squad not only with immense pride but raising their fists. The night before they had made sure to wash and shave. They weren’t afraid of what was about to happen. They saw it as an honour.”
The executions occurred months before Hitler’s defeated forces began withdrawing from Greece in October 1944, more than three years after the Wehrmacht marched into Athens and four after Mussolini ordered a full-scale invasion of Greece from Italian-occupied Albania.
Heuer, who was stationed in the country from 1943 was probably part of a unit dispatched by Joseph Goebbels’ ministry of enlightenment and propaganda to document daily life in territories under occupation. “The images allow us to frame the drama of occupied Greece also through the eyes of the occupier,” Lina Mendoni, the culture minister, said in a statement.
The collection is thought to include 262 photographs. Some bear the handwritten note “Aten 1.5.44” – the date of the massacre.
Greek historians, who have long lamented the paucity of archival material from the period, have described the pictures as exceptional, saying their unexpected discovery will not only help research into Nazi-era atrocities but “open up the space” for further discussion into the bloody 1946-49 civil war that followed the country’s liberation.
For decades, Greece’s communist KKE party was deemed illegal and commemoration of events such as the May Day executions was prohibited, in part because access to sites such as the Kaisariani firing range was off-limits. Until the collapse of military dictatorship in 1974, successive rightwing governments marginalised the role played by the leftist-led resistance during the second world war.
In recent days, relatives who have recognised ancestors in the photographs have come forward demanding that the events of a period steeped in such trauma be finally acknowledged.
“At last, we have pictorial confirmation of what has haunted the Greek left for decades,” said Kostis Karpozilos, a professor of history at Panteion University in Athens. “These images will open up the space for much-needed debate around the politics of memory in contemporary Greece which for so long have been overshadowed by the divisions of the civil war.”
Indicative of that rancour, the marble plaque commemorating the 200 was vandalised and smashed by far-right vandals within hours of the photographs coming to light last weekend.
On Friday, the memorial honouring the dead, in front of the wall where the men were shot, was covered with a mound of red carnations, testimony, say officials, to the surge in visitors wanting to pay their respects.
“There has been a huge emotional response to these images,” said Anastasis Gkikas at the history department of the communist party’s central committee. “We’ve been inundated by calls from descendants of our dead comrades asking for the photographs to be returned to Greece. This is where they belong and this is where they should be put on public display for all to see.”

Ex-Trump advisor warns US president will ‘run out of patience’ on Iran
Donald Trump's former national security advisor has warned that the president is going to "run out of patience," as the Republican said on Friday (20 February) he’s “considering” ordering airstrikes on Iran.
Mr Trump has warned that Tehran must reach an agreement with the US on curbing its nuclear program or risk “bad things."
When asked whether he was considering limited strikes from U.S. warplanes as a way to apply more pressure, Mr Trump replied: “I guess I can say I am considering that.”
"I think you'll see a sustained air campaign against the Iranian regime," H.R. McMaster told BBC Newsnight.

MPs to consider inquiry into trade envoy role after Andrew’s arrest
Former prince was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office after allegations were made against him following the release of Epstein files
- Bookmark
An influential group of MPs are considering launching a parliamentary probe into the role of UK trade envoys after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office.
The business and trade committee will discuss its options on Tuesday amid the police investigation after allegations were made against the former prince following the release of files related to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
It is understood that any inquiry would look at potential governance issues within the wider system and lessons to be learned, avoiding specific commentary on Mr Mountbatten-Windsor until there is no risk of prejudicing criminal proceedings.
MPs could also consider looking more broadly at the appointment and accountability of UK trade envoys at the meeting.
The committee’s chair, Liam Byrne, told The Telegraph he is taking the matter “acutely seriously”, saying that MPs “are not in the market for letting anything slip through the cracks”.
It comes amid reports that Lord Mandelson – who was forced to resign over his links with Jeffrey Epstein – backed Mr Mountbatten-Windsor for the role despite the King expressing opposition to it.
The Telegraph reported that King Charles urged his mother Elizabeth II to block the appointment, with one source telling the newspaper he expressed concerns that Andrew’s “head would be turned by rich people”.
The King also reportedly warned that his brother couldn’t “help himself” when temptation was put in his way.
But the warnings were ignored, with Lord Mandelson having reportedly argued the former prince was “well suited” to the role.
Sir Iain Duncan Smith, who was leader of the Opposition when Andrew was appointed to the role, said the committee “needs to ask the question of was Mandelson involved and if so why?”
He added: “To what degree did Tony Blair know Mandelson was supporting this, because none of this would have happened if Andrew hadn’t been appointed in the first place.”
Meanwhile, Reform UK’s Richard Tice said: “Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s appointment as UK trade envoy must be urgently investigated. His close ties to Jeffrey Epstein were clear at the time, and Andrew continued in his role even after Epstein’s first conviction for soliciting prostitution from minors.
“Questions must be asked as to why Tony Blair’s government thought this man was fit to represent us on the world stage.”
However, it is understood that no such questions would be asked until the criminal proceedings have concluded.
Dubbed “Air Miles Andy” amid criticism of his globetrotting, Andrew was accused of overusing helicopters at taxpayers’ expense during his 10-year stint in the role, in particular to attend golf-related dinners as a member of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.
As a roving ambassador, one of his first tasks was a post-September 11 trip to New York, but Andrew faced a backlash for attending a party during his stay.
His relations with Timor Kulibayev, son-in-law of the president of Kazakhstan, were scrutinised after Mr Kulibayev purchased the former duke’s Sunninghill Park home for £3m more than its £12m asking price in 2007.
And he also faced questions over his connections to politicians in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tunisia, Libya and Turkmenistan.
Andrew was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office after allegations were made against him following the release of files related to paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.
It comes as the government vowed to consider removing him from the line of succession once police investigations have concluded.
Despite being stripped of his title last year, the former Duke of York is still eighth in line to the throne and an act of parliament would be required to remove Andrew and prevent him from ever becoming king.
Sir Keir Starmer’s government will consider introducing such legislation once police have finished their investigation into the King’s disgraced brother, it is understood.
The former duke spent 11 hours in police custody on his 66th birthday on Thursday before being released under investigation following allegations he shared sensitive information with Epstein during his time as the UK’s trade envoy.
Detectives continued to search his former home, Royal Lodge, in Windsor, Berkshire, on Friday.

US Ultimatum to Iran: what Comes Next?

US President Donald Trump has upped the pressure on Iran to reach an agreement in the dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme. If no solution is found within 10 to 15 days “bad things” will happen, he warned. Iran has announced a “resolute and appropriate” response in the event of an attack. Commentators discuss the consequences of a US attack for the region.
Tehran hopes to benefit from war

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Political scientist Vali Nasr analyses the situation in the Financial Times (United Kingdom):
“There is an emerging consensus in Tehran that Iran will not win anything at the negotiating table. It will instead have to accept war, prepare to manage it, and hope that conflict eventually leads to the change it is seeking – by exhausting the US to the point that it abandons the pursuit of future aggression and agrees to a more favourable nuclear deal. ...The US expects the people to rise up again and topple their leaders. Iran’s rulers hope for the opposite: that war will spark patriotic fervour and nationalism will prevail.”
Aiming to control the regime’s decline
From an American perspective there are several arguments in favour of an attack, Italy’s Corriere della Sera puts in, with an analysis by Michael Rozenblat of the US think tank Atlantic Council in mind:
“The regime’s internal systemic weaknesses – hyperinflation, water shortages and widespread corruption – together with the recent protests point to an inexorable decline. But passively waiting for its collapse is not a sustainable strategy for safeguarding America’s regional interests. An active approach, including military intervention, would enable Washington to steer the transition, ensure a favourable post-regime environment and deprive Russia and China of the opportunity to exploit a power vacuum in Iran.”

No plan for the day after
Der Standard (Austria) argues against a US attack:
“Finally getting rid of the mullah regime would be a blessing for the people of the country, a relief for many neighbouring states and the elimination of an existential threat for Israel. But all this only applies if it is possible through a swift, targeted strike, which currently seems highly unlikely. And only if there is a viable plan for the day after. If such a plan exists, it is not apparent at present. This must be counted among the good arguments against an attack.”
Prospect of a long war
The situation is very serious, warns Phileleftheros (Cyprus):
“If there is an attack, it will certainly not be limited to one strike or a series of strikes. Experts in Israel estimate that a possible attack could last for weeks, which would also justify the huge number of forces that the Americans have assembled in the region. Many are hoping, both in Israel and elsewhere, that the Iranian regime will come to its senses and the worst will be avoided. However, we can’t really bet on this.”

Iran demands ‘evidence’ as Trump, UN experts highlight protest killings
UN experts said discrepancy between official figures and grassroots estimates is compounding the anguish of families.
Tehran, Iran – The Iranian government has again blamed “terrorists” for the killings of thousands during last month’s nationwide protests after United States President Donald Trump and human rights experts weighed in.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Saturday that the government has released a list of 3,117 people, whom he described as “victims of recent terrorist operation”, including about 200 security personnel.

“If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence,” the diplomat, who has previously stated that 690 people on the list were “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel, wrote on X.
Araghchi’s comments come hours after the US president told reporters that 32,000 people were killed during the protests, adding that “the people of Iran have lived in hell” under the theocratic establishment.
The Iranian foreign minister has also been speaking with multiple US media outlets to advocate for a “fair” agreement with Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme.
The threat of war looms increasingly large over the country and potentially the region, with Serbia on Saturday becoming the latest country to call on all its citizens to immediately leave Iran.
‘Majority of those killed are ordinary people’
Mai Sato, United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, has said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed, but information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state, six weeks after a nationwide communications blackout was imposed.
The US-based HRANA says it has documented more than 7,000 people killed during the nationwide protests, and is investigating nearly 12,000 more cases.
Sato was among 30 special rapporteurs and international human rights experts who signed a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to fully disclose the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands arrested, forcibly disappeared or missing in the aftermath of the nationwide protests, and to halt all related death sentences and executions.
“The true scale of the violent crackdown on Iranian protesters remains impossible to determine at this point,” the experts said. “The discrepancy between official figures and grassroots estimates only deepens the anguish of families searching for their loved ones and displays a profound disregard for human rights and accountability.”
The international experts added that “the vast majority of those detained or killed are ordinary people, including children, from all provinces and diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as Afghan nationals”, in addition to lawyers representing protesters, medical professionals who treated the wounded, journalists and writers, artists and human rights defenders.
Iranian state media were accused of regularly broadcasting what the experts said are “widely regarded as forced confessions”.
The latest such incident came on Saturday, when the official Mizan news agency of the Iranian judiciary released footage from a court session for three men who said they regret setting fire to motorcycles, a mosque and copies of the Quran in Tehran during the unrest.
Also on Saturday, some students in Tehran and across the country returned to university campuses for the first time, as authorities kept universities closed and took some classes and exams online in the aftermath of the protests.
In Tehran’s Sharif University, one of the most prestigious in the country, students clashed after two separate demonstrations. Videos circulating online showed students shouting “dishonourables” at a group of paramilitary Basij students affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who chanted back in favour of the establishment.
The clashes come amid a heightened security atmosphere in Iranian schools and university dormitories. Teachers and schools in a number of cities near the capital went on strike last week to protest the killing of at least 230 children and teenagers, as well as increased presence of security forces in classrooms.
Families dance in defiant grief
The Iranian government held mourning events on Tuesday and Wednesday in Tehran, with some officials in attendance.
Culture Minister Reza Salehi-Amiri announced on Saturday that the government has decided to call the upcoming ceremonies around Newroz, the new Iranian year starting in late March, an exercise in “unity and empathy” with the aim of “getting past the grief” of thousands killed.
But numerous families have been holding defiant commemoration events of their own over the past week to mark 40 days since the killing of their loved ones during the anti-establishment protests.
Footage from many ceremonies across the country this week showed family members, and large crowds gathered to support them, proudly holding up images of those killed and celebrating their shortened lives.
Many chose to clap, play traditional drums and cymbals, and even dance in symbolic shows of resistance and defiance that heavily clash with religious rituals favoured by the theocratic state.
“May your pen break, O fate, if you do not write about that which befell us,” the father of Abolfazl MirAeez, a 33-year-old killed in the city of Gorgan in the northern province of Golestan, told crowds gathered at a ceremony on Thursday.
“My son was neither a rioter, nor an embezzler nor an aghazadeh [child of an elite]. He was the son of a farmer.”

Trump open to ‘token’ Iran enrichment deal as military options stay on table: Report
US officials say any Iranian offer must be 'very detailed,' prove nuclear program is 'benign,' as Trump reviews military options including scenarios targeting Iran’s supreme leader, his son
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump is prepared to consider an Iranian proposal allowing “token” nuclear enrichment provided it leaves no possible path to a nuclear weapon, US media reported Friday, citing senior US officials.
The news comes as Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran is finalizing a proposal expected to be shared with Washington within days. He said the plan would include political commitments and technical measures to ensure the program is exclusively civilian.
According to a report by website Axios, Washington’s official position remains “zero enrichment” on Iranian soil. However, a senior official said the administration would review a proposal that includes small, symbolic, or “token” enrichment if Iran offers detailed guarantees.
“President Trump will be ready to accept a deal that would be substantive and that he can sell politically at home,” the official said, adding that any proposal must be detailed and demonstrate that Iran’s nuclear program would be peaceful.
Axios also reported that Trump has been presented with military options, including scenarios targeting Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his son Mojtaba, who is seen as a potential successor, and other senior clerics. A second source confirmed that a plan to kill Khamenei and his son was presented to Trump several weeks ago.
Sources told the outlet that no final decision has been made.
A senior White House official said any Iranian proposal must be “very detailed” and prove the nuclear program would be “benign,” adding that Washington would evaluate the offer once it is submitted in writing.
The news follows warnings by Trump that US military action against Iran might be imminent, amid a buildup of US forces in the region.

Hungary says it will block a key EU loan to Ukraine until Russian oil shipments resume
Hungary says it is blocking a major EU loan for Ukraine until Russian oil starts flowing again through the Druzhba pipeline
- Bookmark
Hungary will block a planned 90-billion-euro ($106-billion) European Union loan to Ukraine until the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline resumes, Hungary's foreign minister said.
Russian oil shipments to Hungary and Slovakia have been interrupted since Jan. 27, after Ukrainian officials said a Russian drone attack damaged the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian crude across Ukrainian territory and into Central Europe.
Hungary and Slovakia, which have both received a temporary exemption from an EU policy prohibiting imports of Russian oil, have accused Ukraine — without providing evidence — of deliberately holding up supplies.
In a video posted on social media Friday evening, Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó accused Ukraine of “blackmailing” Hungary by failing to restart oil shipments. He said his government would block a massive interest-free loan the EU approved in December to help Kyiv to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years.
“We will not give in to this blackmail. We do not support Ukraine’s war, we will not pay for it,” Szijjártó said. “As long as Ukraine blocks the resumption of oil supplies to Hungary, Hungary will block European Union decisions that are important and favorable for Ukraine.”
Hungary's decision to block the key funding for Ukraine came two days after it suspended shipments of diesel to its embattled neighbor until oil flows through the Druzhba were resumed, and only days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
Nearly every country in Europe has significantly reduced or entirely ceased Russian energy imports since Moscow launched its war in Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Yet Hungary — an EU and NATO member — has maintained and even increased its supply of Russian oil and gas.
Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has long argued Russian fossil fuels are indispensable for its economy and that switching to energy sourced from elsewhere would cause an immediate economic collapse — an argument some experts dispute.
Widely seen as the Kremlin’s biggest advocate in the EU, Orbán has vigorously opposed the bloc’s efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion, and blasted attempts to hit Russia’s energy revenues that help finance the war. His government has frequently threatened to veto EU efforts to assist Ukraine.
Not all of the EU's 27 countries agreed to take part in the 90-billion-euro loan package for Ukraine. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic opposed the plan, but a deal was reached in which they did not block the loan and were promised protection from any financial fallout.

Nations call for trustworthy, secure AI in New Delhi declaration

Dozens of nations, including the United States and China, called for "secure, trustworthy and robust" artificial intelligence, in a declaration issued Saturday after a major summit in New Delhi.
"Advancing secure, trustworthy and robust AI is foundational to building trust and maximising societal and economic benefits," said the declaration signed by 86 countries and two international organisations.
It did not include any concrete commitments but highlighted several voluntary, non-binding initiatives, including to pool AI research capabilities internationally.
"We believe that AI's promise is best realised only when its benefits are shared by humanity," said the statement from the five-day event.
It is called the advent of generative AI, "an inflexion point in the trajectory of technological evolution".
The AI Impact Summit, attended by tens of thousands of people, including top tech CEOs, was the fourth annual global meeting to discuss how to handle generative AI, and the first hosted by a developing country.
The United States, the world's leading AI power, did not sign last year's summit statement.
Hot topics at the Delhi gathering included the societal benefits of multilingual AI translation, the threat of job disruption and the heavy electricity consumption of data centres.
"Recognising the growing demands of AI on energy, infrastructure, and natural resources, we underscore the importance of developing energy-efficient AI systems," the statement said.
Analysts had said ahead of the declaration that the summit's broad focus, and vague promises made at its previous editions in France, South Korea and Britain, would make concrete commitments unlikely.
The summit declaration said that "deepening our understanding of the potential security aspects remains important."
"We recognise the importance of security in AI systems, industry-led voluntary measures, and the adoption of technical solutions and appropriate policy frameworks that enable innovation while promoting the public interest".

Missing men found dead on Snowdon after large-scale rescue operation
The bodies of two men aged 19 and 20 were recovered by mountain rescue teams

- CommentsGo to comments
Two bodies have been found on Yr Wyddfa - also known as Snowdon - after a major search to try to find two missing men.
North Wales Police have confirmed that the two men were aged 19 and 20.
Concerns for the welfare of the pair were reported to police on Wednesday. Major search efforts were launched by rescue teams, who scoured the mountain in wintry conditions.
Crews from Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team, Aberglaslyn Mountain Rescue Team, RAF Mountain Rescue Service, SARDA and HM Coastguard were deployed and carried out extensive searches on Yr Wyddfa until the early hours of Thursday morning, before resuming at 8am.
Tragically, the bodies of the two men were located and recovered. Both have now been formally identified and their families have been informed.
Jurgen Dissmann, chair of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team, said: “On behalf of Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team, I would like to extend our most heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of the two men who have tragically lost their lives.
“The team were tasked by North Wales Police and launched an extensive multi-agency operation in full winter conditions. Volunteers searched across challenging mountain terrain in snow and ice, working long hours through the night in difficult weather in an effort to locate the pair as quickly as possible.
"Despite the determined and sustained commitment of everyone involved, we are deeply saddened that, despite all efforts, the outcome was not what we had hoped for.
“I would like to sincerely thank our colleagues from Aberglaslyn Mountain Rescue Team, RAF Mountain Rescue Team, SARDA and HM Coastguard for their invaluable assistance throughout the operation.”
Standing at over 3,000 feet, Yr Wyddfa is the highest mountain in the Eryri National Park.
The coroner has been notified.

Israel wants to execute Palestinians and the world will allow it

Israel wants to execute Palestinians and the world will allow it
A bill legalising the execution of Palestinians is being pushed through the Knesset. International indifference paved the way for it.
The Israeli Knesset is pushing through a bill that, if passed, would allow the occupation authorities to legally execute Palestinians. This development has attracted hardly any international attention, but for Palestinians, it is yet another looming horror.
The bill is part of the deal that allowed the formation of Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition government in late 2022. It was demanded by Itamar Ben-Gvir, now national security minister, who has led a reign of terror across the West Bank for the past three years.
In November, the bill passed its first reading, and in January, its provisions were revealed: execution carried out within 90 days of sentencing, no appeals, and death by hanging. Palestinians charged with planning attacks or killing Israelis would face the death penalty. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for the execution of Palestinians, most recently during his visit to Ofer Prison, where he filmed himself overseeing the abuse of detainees.
That we got to this point is hardly surprising. For decades, the international community has neglected the fate of Palestinian prisoners. In the past two and a half years, there has been almost no global reaction to the mass brutalisation of Palestinians held in Israeli jails with or without charges. Israeli efforts to legalise executions of Palestinian is the logical next step in eliminating the Palestinian question.
‘Prisoners’ or captives?
The use of the term “prisoners” to refer to Palestinians held by Israel is deceptive. It strips this cruelty of its context – the military occupation and colonisation Palestinians live under. Prisoners of war or captives are much more accurate terms. That is because Palestinians are taken away either for resisting the occupation or for no reason at all – for the sake of terrorising their families and communities.
Currently, more than a third of the Palestinians Israel is holding are under “administrative detention” – ie, they are being held without charge – and some are women and children. Palestinians are also “tried” in military courts, which are blatantly biased against the occupied population.
I, myself, was a victim of this system of oppression through unjust detention.
In November 2015, Israeli soldiers burst into my home in Ramallah and took me away. They tortured and isolated me for weeks without even telling me what I was accused of.
Eventually, they came up with an accusation of “incitement”, for which they did not produce any evidence. They kept me under their “administrative detention”, or what is really an arbitrary arrest. The abuse continued, and during one interrogation session, an Israeli officer threatened me with rape.
They treated me like an animal without rights or legal protection. Representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross were prevented from visiting me. I was released only after I went on a hunger strike for three months and my condition deteriorated to a dangerous level.
This happened to me 10 years ago, long before October 7, 2023. Back then, the international community was turning a blind eye to Israel’s violations of international law through administrative detention and abuse.
After October 7, the conditions in Israeli military prisons worsened, with rampant torture, starvation and medical neglect. At least 88 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli detention since then. The international community has remained silent, issuing an occasional weak condemnation.
Legalising the illegal
Israel’s brutal mistreatment of detained Palestinians is in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions, which it is a party to. By virtue of being under occupation, Palestinians are considered a protected population and have rights which the Israeli authorities have systematically denied.
Nevertheless, the international community has accepted these flagrant violations. Under the guise of anti-terrorism, the international discourse has transformed Palestinians from an occupied people to threats to Israeli and international security.
Not even the shocking images and testimonies of mass rape at Israeli detention centres managed to overturn this flawed framing.
In this context, the death penalty bill is not an extremist proposal; it fits right into the pattern of the brutalisation of Palestinian detainees.
From the perspective of the Palestinians, this bill is yet another tool of Israeli revenge. If passed, it would spread more fear and further diminish any peaceful resistance against the Israeli settlers’ violent assaults on the Palestinian people and their property.
The bill is also a nightmare for every family that has a member in an Israeli prison. They have already been pushed to the edge by the lack of information about their loved ones since a ban on visiting amid the spike in deaths in detention.
Even more horrific is the prospect that the bill may be applied retroactively. This means anyone with the charges of planning or causing the death of an Israeli could be executed.
There are currently reports in Israeli media that supposedly, the Israeli government is under pressure not to push forward with this law. There have been some suggestions to amend the text to make it more palatable. But we know that Israel will eventually get to executing Palestinians. Just as it has done with other laws, it will deceptively manoeuvre to minimise reactions but still proceed with what it wants to do.
As Israel is well on its way to bulldozing through yet another international legal norm, the most it will likely get is “calls for restraint” or “statements of condemnation”. Such weak rhetoric has enabled its onslaught against international law for the past few decades, and especially during the past two and a half years.
If the international community wants to salvage what is left of the international legal regime and save face, it is time to radically change its approach.
Instead of making weak statements about respect for international law, they must impose sanctions on Israel. Israeli officials who have been accused of committing crimes against Palestinians should not be hosted but held to account.
Only then can there be hope for the safe and peaceful return of all Palestinian prisoners – something that was already agreed upon during the Oslo Accords. And only then can there be hope that Israeli efforts to dismantle international law so it can do as it pleases in Palestine will be stopped.

Marshal of Polish Sejm to focus on three topics during his speech in Verkhovna Rada on February 24
His speech will focus on three topics, including support for Ukraine's sovereignty, its European future, and pressure on Russia. He stated this in an interview with Ukrinform.
“There are three issues. First, full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Second, the need to maintain pressure on Russia. Third, Ukraine's European future. It will be a speech about security, responsibility, the future, and friendship,” Czarzasty said.
He added that Warsaw supports Kyiv's European path and is ready to share its vision and experience of the European integration process.
The marshal of the Polish Sejm stressed that he wants to be in Kyiv with Ukrainians on February 24, as this has “political and symbolic” significance for him.
"This is the day when Russia decided to destroy a sovereign state and defeat its people. We Poles know what that means. But Russia did not crush you. As Marshal of the Sejm of Poland, a member state of the EU and NATO, your neighbor and friend, I want to be in Kyiv at a time when Ukraine is reminding the world that it is defending not only itself but also the European security order. Ukraine's stability and resilience are part of Poland's security. I believe that at such moments, presence matters, both politically and symbolically. It is an honor for me to speak in the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine," Czarzasty emphasized.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Ministry of Digital Transformation stated that Poland has provided Ukraine with more than 29,000 Starlink terminals during the full-scale war and continues to support their operation financially.

Algorithms of War are Shifting

Over the past week, Ukrainians have sensed a change in the algorithm of Russian air attacks.
Russia always wants Ukrainians to tremble at the thought of any contact with their negotiators or with representatives from other states that want Ukraine to capitulate.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Official meetings involving a Ukrainian delegation or President Zelensky himself have always been accompanied by especially massive missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure, residential buildings, and transportation routes.
The most recent Munich Security Conference, however, proceeded without the usual noisy soundtrack of explosions and death tolls. Russian attacks continued, of course. Hundreds of drones, dozens of missiles continued to blow up Ukrainian homes and businesses, but this was “business as usual.” You could not call it an “escalation.”
In his closing remarks, acting conference leader Wolfgang Ischinger said that the future of the European continent depended on the outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian war. That outcome remains unknown, but does the change in the Kremlin’s usual pattern of shelling reveal a shift in strategy?
In the lead-up to and during the Munich Conference, Ukrainian forces carried out localized counteroffensive operations in Zaporizhzhia region and the Donbas.
These counteroffensive strikes were not officially reported and we lack details, but the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) confirmed that Ukraine has liberated more than 200 square kilometers of its territory in the South during the past two weeks.
ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment, February 20, 2026
The French international television channel TV 5 Monde added that until the beginning of February, Russian troops had been taking advantage of illegal access to Starlink communications, and the Ukrainian Armed Forces’(AFU) success coincided with the blocking of this access.
For Russian milbloggers, and indeed for Russians in general, the main topic right now is not the Munich Conference or the Ukraine’s localized counteroffensive, but the “slowing down” if not to say shutting down of Telegram messenger, a key platform for bloggers.
This de facto shutdown happened immediately after Elon Musk disabled the Russian military’s massive and illegal access to Starlink. The resulting setbacks for the Russian military sparked a wave of despair on pro-Kremlin milbloggers’ Telegram channels, and perhaps this was one of the reasons for the disruption of the popular messaging app.
Russians’ discontent with the shutdown, however, has proven far more pronounced than the now-forgotten short-lived protests against the war in the very beginning of the full-scale invasion.
Surprised by the unexpected courage of compatriots in their protest, officials from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s main internet censor, have announced that they are negotiating with Telegram management and that if Telegram complies with Russia’s demands, its service in the Russian Federation will be restored.
Immediately after the Munich Conference, Ukrainian drones struck the infrastructure of Russian border towns, and now several of them are experiencing problems with heating and electricity, just like most of Ukraine.
As usual, the city of Belgorod, located only 72 km from Kharkiv, Ukraine, suffered the most. It is the most easily accessible large city for Ukraine’s retaliatory strikes. However, Moscow refuses to provide Belgorod with additional air defense systems.
The acting Governor of Belgorod Region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has repeatedly requested additional assistance from Moscow, but no help has been forthcoming. Recently, he stated that he has no choice but to seek assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross.
This statement could have been made either to put pressure on the Kremlin or to force Putin to remove Gladkov from his position as regional governor – a position which is becoming increasingly unenviable.
The residents of the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk – fifteen kilometers from the front line, have experienced constant attacks for nearly four years.
Last year, the city was hit by rockets, drones, and artillery 240 times. Up to 80,000 people, including about 5,000 children, still live in the city. They have been offered free-of-charge evacuation to Zakarpattia or the Ivano-Frankivsk region in western Ukraine, but those who remain in the town are in no hurry to take up the offers.
In interviews with foreign journalists, some elderly residents have stated that they would remain in the city even if it were occupied by Russia. They usually don’t tell Ukrainian journalists this.
Young people in Kramatorsk don’t want to join Russia and are ready to leave for other Ukrainian cities if the threat of occupation becomes imminent.
An interesting phenomenon of unfinished crimes is also part of the Kramatorsk area’s algorithm.
Recently, a car was stolen from soldiers and then found abandoned. The thieves filled it with gas at one of the city’s gas stations and left it there.
A week or so before, an Orthodox monastery near Kramatorsk was robbed overnight. The robbers removed the heavy bells and church furnishings. But all of this, along with a trailer belonging to the robbers, was found hidden in a nearby forest.
It’s impossible to smuggle stolen goods through the densely populated checkpoints and, if you try to bypass them, you are very likely to hit a mine.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it were someday revealed that these fruitless, wartime thefts formed part of an attempt by local criminal elements to maintain their underhanded skills.
For now, the city holds on; bakeries bake bread, and construction workers continually erect new concrete shelters. Residents of Kramatorsk don’t spend time thinking about how their future is connected with that of the entire European continent.
But in fact, that’s exactly how it is. Acting Head of the Munich Security Conference, Ischinger, knows this. All of Europe knows it.
Russia understands it, too. And perhaps that’s why the Kremlin is looking for something new, for a new algorithm of this war, trying to devise new strategies to win a greater say in the future of Europe.

4 years of war keeps Ukrainians scattered across Europe in limbo

Maryna Bondarenko has three suitcases ready in her apartment in Poland waiting for the day when the war ends and peace returns to Ukraine.
The 51-year-old journalist fled Kyiv with her son and mother after Russia launched its invasion on February 24, 2022. She thought they would be abroad for a month or two until the war ended.
Four years later, she is still there, working in a Ukrainian-language newsroom that caters to a community of more than 1.5 million Ukrainians living in Poland.
"There were so many moments when we thought: 'This is it, we're finally going back.' We went to the post office several times, packed our belongings into boxes, absolutely certain that we were going back," she said.
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two. More than 5 million Ukrainians are scattered across Europe, according to U.N. figures, many of them in Central and Eastern Europe.
Roughly three-quarters of the refugees are women and children, after Ukraine imposed martial law prohibiting men of military age from leaving the country.
Bondarenko longs to be reunited with her husband, Andrij Dudko, a 44-year-old former TV cameraman who is serving as a drone operator on the front line. But waves of Russian air strikes - which have cut power to tens of thousands of people in Kyiv during a bitter winter - convinced her to stay.
"We get ready to leave, and then there's another massive attack. We get ready again, and then cold winter comes and there is no heating, no power, no water. And I just can't bring my child there, under the rockets."
In Poland, large Ukrainian communities have sprung up in cities such as Warsaw and Krakow, sometimes prompting tensions with local residents who complain of the new arrivals taking welfare benefits and jobs.
"I want to go home, I really do. I know it won't be easy," said Bondarenko, adding that the country she returns to will be profoundly changed.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government hopes that 70% of Ukrainians abroad will return, once the war ends. But surveys have shown that, over time, the share of Ukrainians who say they want to go back is declining.
For many among the younger generation of Ukrainians abroad - like Bondarenko's 11-year-old son Danylo - the country is a distant memory.
He likes Poland, despite experiencing some hostility toward Ukrainians in school.
"I don't really remember anyone from Ukraine. I remember I had one friend, but I do not really remember him and I've lost contact with him," he said. "I don't think that I will return to Ukraine."
Iryna Kushnir and Olga Yermolenko, who were friends at high school in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, rekindled their friendship after they both fled to Istanbul at the start of the war, part of a far smaller number of Ukrainians who sought shelter in Türkiye.
"I thought the war would end quickly, so I didn't plan to stay in Istanbul for long," said Kushnir, 42, who left her 19-year-old daughter Sofia behind in Ukraine to study.
But four years later, she is married to a Turkish man and has a teaching job at the Ukrainian department of Istanbul University.
"Like all Ukrainians, I planned to return home, but life turned out differently," said Kushnir, who says she is proud that her daughter has chosen to remain in Ukraine.
Her friend, Yermolenko, 43, works remotely from Istanbul as a financial specialist for Ukrainian clients. Her mother Tetyana, 73, still lives in Kharkiv and they are constantly in touch.
"I cannot say I am involved 100% in Turkish life. It is a bit strange feeling to be caught between your previous life and a possible future life," said Yermolenko, who has started learning Turkish. She still closely follows events in Ukraine but tries not to think about how long the war will last.
"I open the news - there's a Telegram channel that reports what's happening in Kharkiv in real time - and I see a missile flying toward my home," she said. "In that moment, the feeling is terrifying. I'm very scared. And of course, I immediately call my mom to make sure she's okay."

Afghanistan quake causes no 'serious' damage, injuries: official
A 5.8-magnitude earthquake that rocked eastern Afghanistan including the capital Kabul has resulted in only minor damage and one reported injury, a disaster official told AFP news agency on Saturday.
The quake hit on Friday just as people in the Muslim-majority country were sitting down to break their Ramadan fast.
The epicentre was near several remote villages around 130 kilometres (80 miles) northeast of Kabul, the United States Geological Survey said.
"There aren't any serious casualties or damages after yesterday's earthquake," said Mohammad Yousuf Hamad, spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority.
He added that one person had sustained "a minor injury in Takhar", in Afghanistan's north, "and three houses had minor damage in Laghman" province.
Zilgay Talabi, a resident of Khenj district near the epicentre, said the tremor was "very strong, it went on for almost 30 seconds".
Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, particularly along the Hindu Kush mountain range, near where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet.
In August last year, a shallow 6.0-magnitude quake in the country's east wiped out mountainside villages and killed more than 2,200 people.
Weeks later, a 6.3-magnitude quake in northern Afghanistan killed 27 people.
Large tremors in western Herat, near the Iranian border, in 2023, and in Nangarhar province in 2022, killed hundreds and destroyed thousands of homes.
Many homes in the predominantly rural country, which has been devastated by decades of war, are shoddily built.
Poor communication networks and infrastructure in mountainous Afghanistan have hampered disaster responses in the past, preventing authorities from reaching far-flung villages for hours or even days before they could assess the extent of the damage.

Finnish foreign minister on Trump's second term: "We’ve learned not to be shocked by minor things"
Finland

Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen (NCP) has welcomed the US Supreme Court’s decision on Friday that stripped President Donald Trump of his right to freely impose import tariffs using the pretext of a state of emergency.
"It’s important that the rule of law also functions in the United States. When the president makes decisions that potentially violate the law, this can at least be stated," Valtonen said on Yle TV1's Ykkösaamu talk show on Saturday.
Tariffs have been a cornerstone of Trump's foreign and economic policies. He responded to the ruling by imposing a 10 percent global import tariff, based on different legislation.
Valtonen downplayed the impact of the new tariff.
"From the point of view of Finland and our companies, it’s important to note that there’s actually not much difference here from the situation we have been in up until now," she declared.
Valtonen pointed out that a large number of Finnish companies have been doing business in the US for a long time, and that many have moved more strongly into the US market.
"I believe that the potential there is really great, regardless of what the US administration's tariff decisions are in the coming months or years," the minister said.
She acknowledged that the first year of Trump's second term has been exceptional in terms of trade, foreign and security policy – and said she expects more ups and downs.
"But over the past year, we’ve learned not to be shocked by minor things," Valtonen added, stressed that Finland's trade policy is part of the larger EU trade policy.
Will the US attack Iran?
In recent weeks, the US has concentrated military power in the Middle East and threatened Iran with military action.
Valtonen does not believe that the US will risk a ground attack, but says it could launch air strikes.
She said that Finland does not support an attack on Iran, instead calling for a negotiated solution. On the other hand, she agrees that the current Iranian regime is almost certainly seeking to develop a nuclear weapon.
"The most important thing would be to get a regime in Iran that primarily seeks to optimise the wellbeing of its people, rather than this kind of power politics and intimidation," Valtonen said.
She noted that the EU has recently added Iran's Revolutionary Guard to its list of terrorist organisations, calling this "a safe way to exert influence".
On Saturday afternoon, the Foreign Ministry updated its travel advisory to Finnish citizens in Iran.
"The security situation in Iran may continue to deteriorate rapidly. Consider the necessity of your stay in Iran and actively seek alternatives to leaving the country. Rapid changes in air traffic are possible," it said in a statement.
"While in the country, make sure that you have sufficient food and water supplies and, if traveling by car, that you have enough fuel," the advisory continued.
Racism scandals have "not affected Finland’s image at all"
Viewers had an opportunity to ask Valtonen questions during the programme. The nation’s top diplomat was asked how the various racist incidents during the government's term have affected Finland's image around the world.
"Not at all. In fact, Finland has a really good reputation all over the world," Valtonen replied.
In December, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo issued a rare apology over the latest round of racist social media posts by Finns Party politicians, with a Finnish MEP declaring that the furore had been "harmful to Finland's image and trade relations". The nativist Finns Party is the NCP's main governing partner.
Valtonen was also asked whether she intends to challenge Orpo for leadership of the National Coalition Party next summer, to which she answered simply "no".
Orpo has led the party for nearly a decade.

Andrew arrest has ‘huge ramifications,' with monarchy 'certainly approaching end,' says campaigner against UK monarchy
Head of anti-monarchy group chief says Epstein scandal has 'blown open a lid on this whole culture of rich and powerful men thinking they can get away with anything'
LONDON
Revelations in the case of convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein could have “huge ramifications around the world” and inflict lasting damage on constitutional monarchies, the head of an anti-monarchy group said following this week’s brief arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, with police inquiries into the former royal continuing.
Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, which advocates the elimination of the British monarchy, told Anadolu that the case had “blown open a lid on this whole culture of rich and powerful men thinking they can get away with anything."
"And that's going to do huge damage to monarchies everywhere, particularly the ones in democratic countries and certainly ours," he added.
Smith said former Prince Andrew’s central role in the controversy had intensified scrutiny of the royal household.
“And I think the fact that Andrew is at the heart of this, and that has been dragging on for years, we've known about these allegations for years, and everyone's known that he's (been) someone of questionable reputation for years, and they've done nothing about it, and they've tried to hide, and they've tried to pay off victims. That's going to cause huge damage to this monarchy,” he said.
His comments come amid continuing police searches at Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home, Royal Lodge, a day after he was released under investigation.
'I hope it's a proper investigation, but we'll have to wait and see'
The former prince was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of misconduct in public office and taken to a Norfolk police station for questioning.
The younger brother of King Charles served as the UK’s trade envoy from 2001 to 2011. He withdrew from royal duties in 2019 after his connection to Epstein – who died the same year in a jail cell – became public.
According to a January US release of files related to Epstein, on Oct. 7, 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China, and Hong Kong.
The former royal has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
He was released under investigation by Thames Valley Police on Thursday evening after spending much of his 66th birthday in custody.
Being released under investigation means he faces no restrictions and is not subject to conditions such as curfews or travel bans.
Buckingham Palace has previously said it would support Thames Valley Police in their inquiries.
After his brother’s arrest, King Charles said “the law must take its course.”
Smith said the handling of the investigation would be closely watched.
“It's being done properly, certainly at the moment, how far they take it is another question. Whether there's any pressure on them to truncate it, to shorten it. We'll have to wait and see, but it certainly has the appearance of a proper investigation,” he said.
“The fact that they arrested them and took them to a police station is quite extraordinary. I hope it's a proper investigation, but we'll have to wait and see.”
'I reported Andrew to the police over separate allegations'
Smith said he had previously reported Andrew to the police over separate allegations.
“It was over two weeks ago that I reported Andrew for the 2010 allegations of trafficking, which was a different young woman to Virginia Giuffre. I have, two years ago, reported him on the Virginia Giuffre allegations,” he said, adding that an earlier complaint was dismissed on the basis that it had already been examined.
Giuffre was one of the most prominent accusers of Epstein, and after her suicide last year at age 41, her family has continued to advocate for survivors and victims of sex trafficking.
On the most recent allegations, Smith said: “This latest one, these allegations, he's been arrested for … I reported to the police, started last week, and as far as I was the only one that did that, and that they are following up on that report.”
He argued that the scale of the scandal left police with little room to maneuver, citing the high-profile case involving Peter Mandelson, who last year served briefly as British ambassador to the US before being dismissed over his ties to Epstein. Mandelson earlier this month resigned from the Labour Party and the House of Lords, and police began a criminal investigation into alleged misconduct in public office.
“It's very difficult for them to say, well, you know: ‘We'll do that with Mandelson, but not with Andrew.’ So they were kind of boxed in,” Smith said.
Asked whether the latest developments marked a decisive turning point for the monarchy, Smith said it was “certainly approaching the end,” but added whether it is “the end of the end or the beginning of the end” remains to be seen.
Legislation to remove Andrew from line of royal succession
Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne, although several younger royals stand ahead of him, making it highly unlikely he would ever become king. Legally, however, that still remains a possibility, however distant.
The British government is now considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew from the line of royal succession amid the uproar following his arrest.
He also technically remains a counsellor of state, able in theory to stand in for the monarch if required, although in practice only working royals are called upon to carry out those duties.
Voices from the public
Outside Buckingham Palace, the latest revelations surrounding Andrew have sparked sharp reactions from the public.
Linda, from South Wales, expressed frustration over Andrew's handling of the allegations.
"If he says he’s innocent, (then he should) go to America and say you’re innocent over there," she said. "Go to court and stand up for your rights, but he knows he is guilty."
She called the details of the scandal "disgusting," adding that someone in his position should have shown more "common sense and compassion."
The sentiment was echoed by international visitors too.
One German tourist said that a person’s status – royal or otherwise – should not grant them immunity.
"No matter if you are royal, no matter if you are a civilian ... If you use the trust of people for something criminal, you need to be charged," she stated.
The tourist, a onetime fan of the late Princess Diana, who also had issues with the royal family, added that she is now more interested in "democratic politics" than the lives of the prominent.

Secret US plan targets Iran's supreme leader as Trump faces critical choice

ALBAWABA - Axios reports that the Pentagon has made backup plans that could include going after Iran's top leaders if talks between Washington and Tehran break down.
According to a U.S. official, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently gave President Donald Trump different military options that would target high-ranking Iranian officials, such as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his son Mojtaba Khamenei, who is widely thought to be a possible successor.
The proposed options, according to reports, go beyond targeting leaders and include attacks on important nuclear and military sites in Tehran. People who know about the talks said that the president is still unsure and that no final approval has been given yet. All options are still being looked at.
The talks are taking place in a region where tensions are rising and Oman is still mediating indirect nuclear talks. While the military buildup in the Middle East has intensified in recent weeks, diplomatic channels remain open. The report says that the administration is thinking about whether using pressure tactics, like the credible threat of force, could make Tehran make concessions.
One diplomatic option that has been talked about is letting Iran do a little bit of uranium enrichment under strict conditions that would stop it from making a nuclear weapon. But sources say that the administration hasn't come to an agreement on whether or not this kind of compromise would be okay.
U.S.-Iran relations have been unstable for years, especially since the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani during Trump's first term. This event made things much worse between the two countries.
There is currently no official word on any operational decision. Officials say that the next few weeks and the course of negotiations will probably decide whether the crisis gets worse or better.

At Galerie Eric Mouchet in Paris, Hazara artists navigate persecution and exile

The Hazara people live in Afghanistan, Pakistan – primarily in the province of Balochistan – and Iran. The origins of the Hazara are a matter of debate. Their Asian features have led to speculation that they are descendants of Genghis Khan's Mongol armies, though this theory seems more fanciful than factual. What is, by contrast, painfully certain is that the Hazara have long been and remain victims of systematic persecution in all three countries.
Because they are overwhelmingly Shiite Muslims, the Hazara have been targets of attacks and massacres in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and in Pakistan, where Sunni extremists hold sway. In Shiite-majority Iran, their status as non-Persian, foreign migrants, often viewed with contempt, puts them at risk. Their history is "a continuum of religious and racial persecution," said Emile Drousie, a specialist in Central Asian cultural scenes and curator of this first exhibition in France dedicated to Hazara artists, at Galerie Eric Mouchet in Paris.

Israeli airstrikes in eastern Lebanon kill 8 Hezbollah members, officials say
Israeli airstrikes on eastern Lebanon have killed eight Hezbollah members
- Bookmark
Israeli airstrikes on eastern Lebanon have killed eight members of the militant Hezbollah group, including several local officials, two officials with the group said Saturday.
The Lebanese Health Ministry put the death toll at 10, but did not distinguish between militants and civilians.
The Hezbollah officials told The Associated Press that the eight militants were killed in strikes near the village of Rayak in northeast Lebanon late Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media about such details.
An Associated Press team that visited the scene of the strike Saturday morning saw that the top floor of a three-story building was knocked out.
The Israeli military said Saturday that several members of Hezbollah’s missile unit, in three different command centers in the Baalbek area in Lebanon, were “eliminated.”
The Israeli army added that the Hezbollah members killed were identified “as operating to accelerate readiness and force build-up processes, while planning fire attacks toward Israel.”
One of the Hezbollah officials said that three of the dead were local commanders and identified them as Ali al-Moussawi, Mohammed al-Moussawi and Hussein Yaghi.
Yaghi was the son of prominent Hezbollah official and one of its founders, Mohammed Yaghi, who died in 2023. Mohammed Yaghi was also a close aide to late Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah who was killed in an Israeli airstrike in September 2024.
Lebanon’s Health Ministry said Saturday that Israeli strikes on eastern Lebanon killed 10 people and wounded 24, including three children.
Ali Abdullah, executive director of Rayak Hospital, told the AP that the strike occurred after sunset, adding that they have received 10 bodies and 21 wounded. He added that the dead included two non-Lebanese — a Syrian man and an Ethiopian woman. The wounded included five Syrians and three Ethiopians.
After the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel triggered war in Gaza, Hezbollah began firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.
Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024, later reined in but not fully stopped by a U.S.-brokered ceasefire two months later.
Since then, Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and has carried out near-daily strikes in Lebanon that it says target Hezbollah militants and facilities. Hezbollah has claimed one strike against Israel since the ceasefire.
The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of intensified tensions in the region as the United States has threatened to strike Iran — a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas — if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program fail to produce a deal.

Gisèle Pelicot on rape, courage and her ex-husband: ‘He was loved by everyone. That’s what is so terrifying’
Unknown

At Gisèle Pelicot’s new home on Île de Ré off France’s Atlantic coast, she likes to take bracing walks along the beach in all weathers, play classical music loud, eat nice chocolate and, as a gift to each new morning, always set the table for breakfast the night before. “It’s my way of putting myself in a good mood when I wake up: the cups are out already, I just need to put the kettle on,” she says.
But one of her most treasured possessions is a box of letters she keeps on her desk. The envelopes from across the world – some sent on a prayer, addressed only with her name and the village in Provence where she once lived – piled up at the courthouse in Avignon in southern France in late 2024, when she became famous worldwide as a symbol of courage for waiving her right to anonymity in the trial of her ex-husband and dozens of men he had invited to rape her while she was drugged unconscious.
For almost a decade, Dominique Pelicot, to whom she was married for 50 years, had crushed sleeping tablets and anti-anxiety medication into her mashed potato, coffee or ice-cream. In an online chatroom called “Without her knowledge”, he had invited dozens of men to rape her in her own bed at the yellow house with blue shutters in Mazan in south-east France, where the couple had retired. “I’m looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my wife who’s been put to sleep,” was one of his lines. The trial, which Gisèle insisted must be held in public, shocked the world, raised awareness of drug-facilitated abuse –which is termed “chemical submission” in France – and brought an outpouring of recognition from women, from Spain to the US, teenagers to 80-year-olds, all of whom wrote to her with their own stories.
“I have all the letters in a beautiful box,” says Pelicot, 73, at the office of her literary agent in Paris’s Left Bank.
She arrives with her new partner, Jean-Loup, a retired Air France steward. They are smiling and clearly happy. She never expected to fall in love again, she says. But in the four years between the “devastation” of being informed by police in 2020 that her ex-husband – who had been caught upskirting in a local supermarket on 12 September that year – had also raped her while she was sedated, and the trial in 2024, she had sought refuge in solitude on the west coast of France. Gisèle had arrived with just two suitcases and the family bulldog, Lancôme, in a state of shock and desolation. Slowly, while out walking, she made new friends. One of them introduced her to Jean-Loup.
“Neither of us had ever thought we’d fall in love again because Jean-Loup lived for 30 years with his wife who then sadly passed away from a neurological illness,” she says. “He was her carer until the end. He’s a very beautiful person. We met and fell in love. We couldn’t have foreseen that. And we’re really happy today. It has changed our lives. So you see, hope is allowed. Even for women who are not necessarily victims of violence, but who can find themselves widowed or alone, divorced. You can love again, you can have several lives in one. That’s my case and I think it’s the case for many women, too.”
She would sit down with Jean-Loup, each night of the trial, in the house they had rented near Avignon, and they would read the letters that were sent to her. “It was a ritual … we’d use a paper knife to open them graciously, out of respect for the writers. And each time, on reading them, tears would flow, because there was a lot of suffering. I think there are some that I still haven’t opened, because there was so much suffering and so many tears in them. But of course I will read them all and I’ll keep them for ever. And maybe, when I depart this earthly world, I’ll pass them on, I’ll entrust them to my grandchildren. And maybe one day they will also be read in schools. I hope that by then, we’ll all have stopped this chemical submission and all sexual violence. But I think there is still a long way to go.”
Gisèle, a former logistics manager at the state electricity company and a grandmother of seven, is now beginning an international book tour after the publication of her memoir, A Hymn to Life. It’s a book about hope, she says. It was an exercise in “introspection” for her to examine her difficult, grief-filled childhood, her “love at first sight” for Dominique (whom she now refers to only as Mr Pelicot), a long-haired 19-year-old wearing a striped Breton top and driving a 2CV, and their subsequent life together. It’s an examination of the “joie de vivre” she says she inherited from the women in her family who overcame tragedy, which gave her the determination to face the trial.
Born in a garrison town in west Germany in 1952, where her soldier father was posted, Gisèle describes a moment when she was four when her mother had slipped on ice. In the doctor’s office, Gisèle spotted a scar under her mother’s hair – a radiotherapy burn, she realised many years later. Nobody had told her about her mother’s brain tumour – it was never discussed. Her mother just kept smiling, never wearing her pain on the outside, something Gisèle says she also learned to do very young.
When Gisèle was nine, her mother died at home in the French countryside in Indre, in the Centre-Val de Loire, where they were living. She remembers trying to wake her. “For me, she was sleeping. But when I saw my father close her eyes, and start crying, he was really devastated by grief.” She and her brother weren’t taken to the funeral but went to the grave a few days later when it was snowing. “I thought: ‘She can’t be OK here, she must be cold,’” she says.
Her father remarried, a stepmother who Gisèle says was verbally abusive and rejected her. But aged 19, on a visit back to her mother’s village, Gisèle met and fell in love with a local electrician: Dominique. He was shy and sweet, another wounded soul, she felt. His family was troubled, harbouring secrets, sexual abuse, violence. She didn’t know the full extent of that then, but she felt they would save each other, make a break, be happy and start a family.
Gisèle had long struggled with sleep, after the death of her mother and later her father and brother, who all died young. “I couldn’t sleep in the dark, I needed the light on,” she says. “I felt it was because I associated sleep with death.”
Today, after being drugged so many times, in a way that court medical experts said could have easily killed her, she says she sleeps well and is at peace with death. “I know it’s inevitable. All of us will face it one day.”
For almost 10 years, from around 2011, Gisèle experienced what she thought were serious neurological issues, including memory lapses she feared were a brain tumour like her mother’s, or an onset of Alzheimer’s, as well as gynaecological problems. She was having black-outs and memory lapses, forgetting what she’d done the day before, forgetting she had been to the hairdresser even if she could see in the mirror that she had had a cut and colour, afraid to drive or that she might miss her stop on the train.
She didn’t know she was being drugged and raped. “I didn’t even know that could exist,” she says. Crucially, neither did the many neurologists and gynaecologists whom she consulted, always accompanied by her supportive husband. One doctor wrote it off as anxiety.
But on a regular basis, her husband was putting medication in her food and drink that sedated her so heavily that it was as if she was on an operating table. “It was really a kind of general anaesthetic,” she says. “And all done with drugs you could have to hand in a medicine cabinet at home.”
His concoction of prescription drugs, honed with online advice from a man who had worked as a nurse, included muscle relaxants, which allowed her limp body to be abused and for Dominique to dress her in underwear he had chosen.
“I feel the cold, so I always wear pyjamas in bed,” she says. “And he managed to undress me, re-dress me as he wanted, and put my pyjamas back on afterwards. Because when I woke up the next morning, I was in my pyjamas. I didn’t wake up wearing something else, thinking: ‘Hang on, I wasn’t like this last night.’ It was all calculated.”
At the time, Gisèle and Dominique Pelicot were living the retirement they had always dreamed of: a house in Provence with a pool, board games on the patio, and visits from their children and grandchildren. Dominique, she says, “was loved by everyone, his children, his friends, his family. There was nothing to trouble the perfect picture. That’s what is so terrifying.”
Looking back now, she says there were some strange moments. She remembers him pouring a cocktail he had made for her down the sink when she said it tasted odd. Or another time, “when I found bleach inexplicably on new trousers and, I don’t know why, but I said to him: ‘You’re not drugging me by any chance are you?’ And he started crying, and I was so destabilised by that. I thought: ‘What have I just said to him?’ And it was me who apologised. Like many victims, you know, I said to myself it was impossible that he could be doing any harm to me. I took it on myself.”
She does not regret insisting that the trial of her husband and 50 other men be held in public, when normally in France a rape trial can take place behind closed doors. Today she feels it was her life’s “mission” to expose not just the crimes, but the justice system’s treatment of rape survivors. That every man on trial was found guilty of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault was a “victory” she says.
The most painful moment for her was having to view the “unbearable” videos that Dominique had carefully saved in a file called “Abuse”. “When you see that body, that rag doll, inanimate, treated as it is being treated …” she begins. “I put myself at a distance from that sedated woman, who isn’t really me. That woman who is in that bed with all those men, it’s not at all me. I think that helped me. Not because I was in denial, but it was to protect myself.”
In the courtroom, she had to face the accused, many sitting very close to her, aged from their 20s to their 60s at the time of the abuse, including a soldier, a journalist, lorry drivers and a nurse, some high-fiving each other outside court and laughing and joking.
Dominique told the court “I am a rapist,” but the majority of the other men denied the charges, saying her husband had said it was OK, or that they thought it was a game.
“They were so casual, it was as if they were there for snatching a handbag,” she says. “I think they hadn’t understood the scale of their crimes. That’s when you realised this was all about the triviality of rape. They looked me up and down as if to say: ‘Why is she troubling us with all of this?’”
“It was the trial of cowardice and denial,” she says. “My decision to make it public lifted the veil on the evils in society, because our society fosters denial. And we’re still seeing it today through what’s emerging in the Jeffrey Epstein case … Everybody shut their eyes.”
For her, this culture of denial means “handing all the strength and power to these types of men”.
She was struck, too, by the testimony of some men’s wives, girlfriends or female friends who attended court to say their loved ones couldn’t possibly have raped anyone. And the three former police officers who appeared as character witnesses for one of the guilty men, who once worked as a karate coach for the police. “They said he had a deep respect for women. I said he had a funny way of respecting women. It says a lot about our macho and patriarchal society, that image of these former police officers, public figures, coming as character witnesses.”
The applause of women who began gathering every day at the courthouse mattered greatly to her. “It carried me,” she says. “I felt less alone. Without them, maybe I wouldn’t have had the strength.”
The shame survivors feel, she says, must change sides, because it is “a double sentence, a suffering we inflict on ourselves”. But there is also “an extreme loneliness” in being a survivor. When we meet, she is wearing the scarf sent to her during the trial by an Australian organisation working to raise awareness of sexual assaults on older women. “It’s a nod to them, to show I’m still connected to them,” she says.
One of the hardest aspects of the case has been the impact on her children and grandchildren. At the trial, Dominique was also found guilty of secretly taking indecent images of their adult daughter, Caroline, and the wives of his two sons.
Caroline, 46, who was also photographed asleep, has now filed a legal complaint accusing her father of drugging and raping or sexually abusing her when she was in her 30s, which he has denied. The relationship between Caroline and Gisèle was strained for a time but Gisele says it has grown closer again. “Caroline feels certain her father sedated her and raped her,” she says. “Unfortunately, that can’t be ruled out. She’s in great suffering and I understand and hear her.”
For Caroline, not having clear proof is a “never-ending hell”, Gisèle says. “It’s wrong to think this type of tragedy brings a family together. It blew everything apart. And each of us is trying to rebuild today in their own way.”
Gisèle says she will visit Dominique in prison, probably later this year, to talk to him face to face one last time. “I need answers,” she says. “Why did you betray us like this? Why did you do so much harm to us? Why? I don’t have answers. I’ve tried to understand. I’ve thought about whether it was connected to rapes that he may have suffered himself when he was young, that he was a ticking timebomb in some way, because he never got psychiatric help. But he nonetheless chose the depths of the human soul. He made that choice.”
Questions also still remain about Dominique’s activities in the 1990s. He has admitted to the attempted rape of a young estate agent outside Paris in 1999, but has denied the rape and murder of another estate agent in Paris in 1991, which police continue to investigate. Gisèle, who has helped police with investigations, said she doesn’t have any knowledge. She remembers him coming home twice in tears in the 1990s but doesn’t remember the dates. “I never saw any blood stains on Mr Pelicot. I never saw he’d been scratched,” she says. She hopes the two families of those women can get closure.
In her own case, there is still the chilling fact that the police were unable to identify all the men filmed raping her. “There are around 20, maybe more, walking free,” she says. “And I do wonder whether one day they will be caught doing it again. It’s terrifying to think they could keep on doing this, as Dominique Pelicot copycats. Because today you can see there are still similar cases happening, and it’s universal, it’s not just in France.”
French society has been changed by the trial. It has opened up crucial public discussion on drug-assisted rape and politicians pushed to have a clear reference to consent added to the rape law.
“Although it’s good to change laws, I think above all you have to change mentalities,” Gisèle says. Sexual offences by drugging are about the attacker “feeling all powerful … There has to be a collective awakening. I think this case has started that, but there is still much further to go. It’s about education – respect and kindness towards others. It’s that simple.”
Men as well as women regularly approach her in the street to give thanks and support, she says. “Men, too, were totally sickened to see the behaviour of the accused.”
In the future, she would like to speak to law students in universities, who may go on to be defence lawyers, on how to treat rape victims. She says her own trial was “like being in a pit with the lions”, where some defence lawyers “sought to humiliate me, say I was complicit, I was consenting, or I was suspect”. She was asked about her sex life, if she drank, if she was an exhibitionist, if she locked the door when she went to the toilet.
The trial also showed that there is no such thing as a minor sexual offence. Ten years before Dominique’s arrest in 2020, he had been caught taking photographs up women’s skirts in the Paris area but got away with a €100 fine and Gisèle was never told. There was a feeling then, she says, that upskirting “wasn’t so bad”. Stopping him then could have saved her a decade of abuse.
Dominique was arrested in 2020 thanks to the young security guard at a supermarket in Carpentras who had caught him upskirting again. She has since been to meet him. “We fell into a hug and I thanked him because if he hadn’t seen what Mr Pelicot was doing in that supermarket – and if the local police officer, Laurent Perret, hadn’t persevered in searching his phone and computer, I think Mr Pelicot would have been missed, he would have continued. And I’m not sure I would be sitting here in front of you today.”
Today, she says she is doing well. Since Dominique’s arrest, she no longer has memory problems, she has regained weight, her hair-loss has stopped. The rapes infected her with several sexually transmitted diseases which doctors have treated and are being monitored. “I think I’m doing well. I’m a survivor, I miraculously survived,” she says.
One day when leaving court, she saw a young woman of 25 weeping uncontrollably, having, potentially, watched the video evidence. Gisèle asked her lawyers if she could go to comfort her. “I wiped away her tears with my hands and said to her that I was OK, and that I needed her to be OK too,” she says. “If she cried, I would collapse in tears, too, and I needed to stay strong.”
She says: “As a child I understood I had to grow up faster than other children and I had to protect my father and my brother because they were devastated by grief at my mother dying. It’s not that I didn’t also carry that grief, but I kept it to myself and I built myself up as a little tin soldier of joy, moving forward step by step each day. And I think that’s what forged my personality.” Maybe, she says, “that’s also why I could accept what happened to me. Because in a way I was prepared for sadness and tragedy. But now I hope that’s over, I’ve had my dose of it. And now I can allow myself to be happy for the years I have left to live.”

Thailand races to contain outbreak of deadly feline virus after 72 tigers die in tourist parks
Tests found that the tigers were infected with feline parvovirus

Thailand is trying to contain a devastating disease outbreak that has killed at least 72 captive tigers at wildlife parks in the northern province of Chiang Mai, officials said on Saturday.
The majority of the deaths were recorded at Tiger Kingdom Mae Taeng and Tiger Kingdom Mae Rim, two privately operated animal parks that allow visitors to interact closely with big cats.
Between 8 and 19 February, 51 tigers died at Mae Taeng and 21 at Mae Rim, according to a timeline released by the regional Protected Area Office.
Preliminary tests by livestock officials found that the 72 dead tigers were infected with feline parvovirus, also known as feline panleukopenia, reported The Bangkok Post.
Veterinary teams from the Chiang Mai provincial livestock office said autopsies confirmed the presence of the virus, while laboratory tests on samples from the carcasses also detected canine distemper virus (CDV) and Mycoplasma bacteria. No traces of influenza A, which causes bird flu, were found.
Feline parvovirus is a highly contagious and often fatal disease that severely attacks the digestive system and immune response, causing vomiting, bloody diarrhoea, high fever, lethargy and loss of appetite.
Canine distemper is a highly contagious virus that spreads through close contact and attacks the lungs, stomach, and sometimes the brain, and it can be fatal in big cats. Mycoplasma is a bacterial infection that affects the respiratory system and can make pneumonia and breathing problems significantly worse, particularly in animals with weakened immune systems.
“Treating sick tigers is very different from treating dogs and cats. Dogs and cats live closely with us, so when they show symptoms, we can respond and provide treatment right away. Tigers, however, aren’t living closely with humans. By the time we notice that something is wrong, the illness may already be advanced,” Somchuan Ratanamungklanon, director-general of Thailand’s department of livestock development, told local media.
The department of livestock development said that inbreeding among captive tigers may have weakened the animals’ immune systems, which could have increased their susceptibility to infection and accelerated the spread of disease.
Authorities have temporarily closed Tiger Kingdom Mae Rim for 14 days, restricted access to both facilities, and deployed teams to disinfect enclosures and equipment.
The Independent has reached out to Tiger Kingdom Chiang Mai for comment.
All surviving tigers have been relocated to quarantine and care centres in Mae Taeng district for close monitoring, and plans are being made to vaccinate healthy animals to prevent further spread, according to The Nation Thailand.
Somchuan said strict biosecurity and disinfection controls were being enforced to limit transmission, and added that canine distemper virus does not infect humans.
“These tigers died the way they lived – in misery, confinement and fear,” the animal rights organisation PETA Asia told AFP.
“If tourists stayed away, these places would quickly become unprofitable, and tragedies like this would be far less likely to happen.”
Thailand has seen serious outbreaks of disease in captive big cats before. In 2004, during the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, at least 147 tigers at the Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Chonburi Province either died from infection or were euthanised to stop the virus spreading.
In 2024, dozens of captive tigers and other big cats died in Vietnam after contracting H5N1 at privately run zoos and safari parks.

India signs critical minerals deal with Brazil to curb dependance on China
Indian Prime Minister Modi hailed the agreement on critical minerals and rare earths as a ‘major step towards building resilient supply chains’.
Brazil and India have signed an agreement to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths, as the Indian government seeks new suppliers to curb its dependence on China.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Saturday and discussed boosting trade and investment opportunities.

Modi said in a statement that the agreement on critical minerals and rare earths was a “major step towards building resilient supply chains”.
China dominates the mining and processing of the world’s rare-earth and critical minerals, and has increased its grip on exports in recent months as the United States attempts to break its hold on the growing industry.
Still, for Brazil, which follows China as the world’s second-largest holder of critical minerals, its resources are used across a range of fields, including electric vehicles, solar panels, smartphones, jet engines, and guided missiles.
In a statement, Lula said, “increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energies and critical minerals is at the core of the pioneering agreement that we have signed today.”
While few details have emerged about the mineral deal so far, demand for iron ore, a material for which Brazil is the second-largest producer and exporter after Australia, in India has grown amid rapid infrastructure expansion and industrial growth.
Rishabh Jain, an expert with the New Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank, told the AFP news agency that India’s growing cooperation with Brazil on critical minerals follows recent supply chain engagements with the US, France and the European Union.
“Global South alliances are critical for securing diversified, on-ground resource access and shaping emerging rules of global trade”, Jain told AFP.
Trade agreements
India’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced that, along with the critical minerals and rare earths deal, nine other agreements were signed, including a memorandum of understanding that ranged from digital cooperation to health.
Moreover, Modi called Brazil India’s “largest trading partner in Latin America”.
“We are committed to taking our bilateral trade beyond $20bn in the coming five years,” he said.
“Our trade is not just a figure, but a reflection of trust,” Modi said, adding that “When India and Brazil work together, the voice of [the] Global South becomes stronger and more confident.”
India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar also said he was confident that Lula’s talks with Modi “will impart a new momentum to our ties”.
According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC) in 2024, Indian exports to Brazil reached $7.23bn, with refined petroleum being the main export. On the other hand, Brazilian exports to India reached $5.38bn, with raw sugar being the main export.

Hundreds march in Lyon to protest far-right activist’s killing as Macron urges calm
Hundreds march in Lyon to protest far-right activist’s killing as Macron urges calm
LYON, France (AP) — About 3,000 people joined a march organized by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in the French city of Lyon, in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of the tribute to Quentin Deranque, 23, who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week. The demonstrations took place under heavy police scrutiny, with no major incidents reported.
“This is a moment of remembrance and respect for this young compatriot who was killed, for his family and loved ones. That must come first. And then it is a moment of firmness and responsibility,” Macron said.
Seven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers next week to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled.
“In the republic, no violence is legitimate,” he said. “There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising.”
Lyon emerges as a battleground
The main tribute to Deranque took place in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Their fighting often takes the form of organized street battles in the city, sometimes involving groups of several dozen people.
Lyon’s far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque’s parents also called for calm and did not take part in the tribute, which was not banned by French authorities.
Deranque’s death triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming the far-left France Unbowed party and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a France Unbowed lawmaker who set up the anti-fascist group The Young Guard.
There was a minute’s silence before the start of the march. Some demonstrators held white tulips and displayed stickers bearing the slogan: “Quentin, killed by Mélenchon’s militia.”
Many men dressed in black, some with their faces partially covered, joined the march. Christian Petiteau, 70, who traveled from the neighboring Isère region, said Deranque was “cowardly murdered” and that he came to honor his memory.
Far-left in focus
France Unbowed’s opponents accuse it of fomenting violence and tensions with its combative far-left politics. Mélenchon has condemned the violence and insisted that his party bore no blame for the tragedy.
Mélenchon stood for the presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022, but failed to advance to the decisive runoff round. He is preparing for another expected run next year, when Macron’s second and last term ends.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonize France Unbowed. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon’s party.
Criticism also came from prominent figures on the left, including former French President François Hollande. He said the mainstream left, including his Socialist Party, must not team up again with Mélenchon’s party for the upcoming elections, as they did in the past.

Ukraine strikes a key industrial site deep inside Russia
Ukrainian drones have hit an industrial facility deep inside Russia, which a Russian news report identified as a major missile factory
- Bookmark
Ukrainian drones struck an industrial site deep inside Russia on Saturday, and a Russian news channel reported the target was a key state-owned missile factory.
The attack took place in Russia’s Udmurt Republic, leaving 11 injured, three of whom were hospitalized, according to a Telegram post by Sergei Bagin, the local health minister.
“One of the republic’s facilities was attacked by drones” launched by Ukraine, regional head Alexander Brechalov said in another Telegram post. He added that the strike caused injuries and damage but did not name the site or give further details.
An unofficial Russian news channel on Telegram, Astra, said Ukrainian drones struck the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, a major state defense enterprise. Astra said its claim was based on an analysis of footage from local residents.
There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.
The Votkinsk factory, more than 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from Ukraine, produces Iskander ballistic missiles, often used in strikes against the country, as well as nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Other Russian news channels posted videos and photos, which they said were from Votkinsk residents, showing black smoke rising from an industrial site and blown-out windows on buildings.
Another unofficial Russian Telegram channel, SHOT, which often quotes contacts in the security services, said residents of Votkinsk reported hearing at least three blasts during the night, as well as what they thought was the humming of drones.

With tariffs ruling, US Supreme Court reasserts its power to check Trump
Sign up now: Get insights on Asia's fast-moving developments
WASHINGTON - After siding with US President Donald Trump in two dozen cases in the past year in ways that boosted his power and let him quickly transform US policies on immigration, military service, federal employment and beyond, the US Supreme Court finally reached its limit.
The court on Feb 20 upended one of Mr Trump’s top priorities in his second term as president, deciding in a blockbuster ruling that his imposition of sweeping global tariffs on nearly every US trading partner exceeded his powers under federal law
The ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, did not waffle in its scope or effect, or leave questions about the legality of the tariffs to another day.
It unswervingly struck them down, making no mention of the consequences for refunds, trade deals or the Republican president himself.
'Legal cover’
In doing so, the court also reasserted its role as a check on the other branches of government including the president, after a year when numerous critics and legal scholars had increasingly voiced doubts.
“The court has shown it will not necessarily provide legal cover for every plank of Mr Trump's platform,” said Professor Peter Shane, an expert in constitutional law and the presidency at New York University School of Law.
The justices in the 6-3 decision upheld a lower court's ruling that Mr Trump’s use of a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act - or IEEPA - did not grant him the power he claimed to impose tariffs, something no president had previously tried to do under the statute.
In no uncertain terms, the Chief Justice wrote in the ruling that Mr Trump's argument that a particular phrase in the law's text gave him power to impose tariffs was wrong.
“Our task today is to decide only whether the power to “regulate ... importation,” as granted to the president in IEEPA, embraces the power to impose tariffs. It does not,” he wrote.
“The decision shows that the Supreme Court is serious about policing the scope of power delegated to the president by Congress,” said Professor Jonathan Adler at William & Mary Law School in Virginia.
“The president cannot just pour new wine out of old bottles,” Prof Adler added. “If there are problems current statutes do not address, the president must ask Congress for a newer vintage.”
The court has a 6-3 conservative majority, but the ruling was not split along ideological lines.
The Chief Justice and fellow conservative justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett - both appointed by Mr Trump in his first term - joined the court's three liberal members to strike down his tariffs. Three other conservative justices dissented.
Mr Trump pulled no punches in rejoinder, casting the decision in extraordinarily personal terms and reserving special wrath for the Republican appointees including his own who ruled against him, calling them “fools” and “lapdogs” for Democrats
“They're very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution,” Mr Trump told reporters, adding, “It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests.”
Emergency requests
For most of 2025, the Supreme Court in case after case sided with Mr Trump's emergency requests to lift orders by lower-court judges blocking some of his boldest policies, while litigation challenging them played out.
Those actions on the court’s so-called emergency - or “shadow” - docket are usually handled without extensive briefing or oral arguments, in contrast with the court's regular work where cases are assessed over months before a definitive ruling is issued.
The tariffs case was argued in November.
Acting in 28 cases on an emergency basis, the court has used multiple legal paths to rule in favor of Mr Trump in 24 of them during his second term, while another was declared moot.
The decisions let him fire federal employees, take control of independent agencies, ban transgender people from the military and deport migrants to countries where they have no ties, among other actions.
Those victories for Mr Trump followed a landmark ruling in 2024 - also authored by the Chief Justice - granting him broad immunity from criminal prosecution on his 2020 election subversion charges.
That decision - and the repeated wins for Mr Trump since - raised doubts among numerous critics and court watchers about the independence of the top US judicial body and its willingness to confront a president aggressively pushing the limits of his power and apt to verbally attack judges who get in his way.
Mr Trump, for instance, called in 2025 for the impeachment of one judge who ruled against him in a major deportation issue, labeling him among other things a “Radical Left Lunatic” - an outburst that prompted a rebuke from the Chief Justice.
At the same time, since early in his second term, questions have swirled over whether Mr Trump's administration has defied unfavorable orders by the federal judiciary, which could provoke a constitutional crisis.
The decisions in favour of Mr Trump frustrated the court’s liberals.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson even observed in one opinion that “this administration always wins”.
Still, some experts had urged patience, noting that the court's recent permissiveness toward Mr Trump might change once it resolved the legality of a major policy after extensive deliberation. That happened on Feb 20.
The shadow docket decisions “were never evidence of the court being particularly sympathetic to or solicitous of the Trump administration,” Prof Adler said.
“This case, on the other hand, is the first time the court has considered one of the Trump administration's policy initiatives on the merits.”
The court is due to hear arguments on April 1 over the legality of another contentious Trump policy, his directive to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States
Previous losses
During Mr Trump’s first term as president, the court handed him some significant losses in pivotal cases, including blocking his plans to add a citizenship question to the national census questionnaire and end a deportation protection for immigrants - known as “Dreamers” - who entered the United States illegally as children.
University of California, Berkeley law professor John Yoo highlighted the fact that the tariffs ruling was joined by justices appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents.
“The decision belies the attacks from the left that the Supreme Court - particularly its conservative majority - simply rubber-stamps the Trump administration's policies,” said Prof Yoo, a former clerk to conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.
Prof Shane noted that the tariffs case did not require the court to wade into the wisdom of Trump's policy or the soundness of his discretion - and may not undermine Mr Trump's power going forward.
“The ruling does suggest that, on pure questions of law that do not put the court in the position of smacking down Trump’s motives or second-guessing his judgment, there is a majority that will not rubber-stamp his action,” he said. REUTERS

Dárek pro Putina Czech initiative raises over $72 million for Ukraine in four years
This was announced by the project's creator, Martin Ondráček, in an interview with Ukrinform.
“We have raised 1 billion 485 million crowns (over $72 million – ed.),” Ondráček said.
According to him, dozens of large campaigns were organized, thanks to which thousands of drones, tens of thousands of ammunition units, and hundreds of vehicles were purchased and transferred to Ukraine.
In particular, 384 million crowns were raised last year, of which 100 million was a one-time donation from the owner of the Czech company Seznam, Ivo Lukačovič. In total, 89,000 people sent donations last year, Ondráček said.
He noted that since the beginning of this year, the number of donors has exceeded 112,000. As of February 19, 228 million crowns have been collected, of which 187 million came from 96,000 donors to the SOS Kyiv campaign to purchase generators amid Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.
As reported, the Dárek pro Putina initiative arose in the early days of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, starting with the Ukrainian Embassy in the Czech Republic opening an account to collect money to purchase weapons for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Zelenskyy sanctions 225 Russian shadow fleet captains
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed decrees enacting decisions by the National Security and Defence Council (NSDC) to apply new sanctions packages, particularly measures against 225 captains of vessels in Moscow's shadow fleet that export Russian oil products.
Source: Zelenskyy in presidential decrees
Details: The list features citizens of 11 countries: Russia, India and the Philippines.
The Ukrainian authorities said monitoring in the Black, Red and Baltic Seas has revealed that these captains commanded vessels from Russia's shadow fleet, transporting oil in breach of EU, G7 and other international sanctions.
A second sanctions package covers 46 Russian citizens, two Iranian citizens and 44 Russian companies servicing Russia's military industrial complex.
These include firms that supplied, developed, produced and repaired equipment, electronic warfare systems and spare parts for Russia's arms industry. Their products were used in the production of ballistic and cruise missiles, attack and reconnaissance drones, small arms and ammunition.
The two Iranian citizens were linked to the supply of aviation parts and components through sanctions evasion. This took place in the interests of the Iranian Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company, a partner of Russia in the development and production of Shahed-type drones, which is already under sanctions imposed by Ukraine, the United States, Switzerland and New Zealand.

Nadiya Hussain reveals major career change after being dropped by the BBC
TV chef says she still has not received ‘closure’ over the broadcaster’s decision to axe her shows last year
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Nadiya Hussain has revealed she has pivoted to a career in teaching after she was dropped by the BBC.
The TV chef had become a fixture on the broadcaster’s schedules for over a decade after winning the sixth series of The Great British Bake Off in 2015.
Her shows, however, including Nadiya’s British Food Adventure, Nadiya’s Everyday Baking and Nadiya’s Everyday Spices, were axed last year with the presenter revealing she had not been given a “definitive” reason.
Speaking to Woman & Home, Hussain revealed that she still “has no idea” as to why she was dropped by the BBC but has turned her attention to a different sort of career.
“I’m currently working as a teaching assistant at a lovely little primary school,” she said. “The plan is to gain some training and maybe in the future become a teacher.”
“'I had to do an application form, an interview, go in and sit in with the kids, and see how they reacted to me,” she said. “I did get people ringing me, asking, ‘Sorry, is this actually the Nadiya Hussain?’ and I’m like, ‘Yes, it is and I am looking for a job, and I would like an opportunity’”
The author, 41, of several cookbooks said that some people have questioned her decision to “go back to the bottom” after her successful stint on screen.
“There have been lots of tears, sadness and judgement,” she said. “People [close to me] have asked, ‘Why would you go from being here, right at the top to being at the bottom?’ but I don’t see it that way. Just because I’m famous doesn’t mean I’m at the top. I have been at my lowest at the top.
“So what does being at the top really mean? Since working at the school, I’ve had some of my highest moments.”
Hussain went on to reveal that she has still not received any “closure” from the BBC over their decision to cancel her shows.
“I appreciate that it’s an industry, it’s a business and it’s about making money, but I still don’t know [why they’ve let me go] because I haven’t had a conversation with anyone. There are no answers, no closure,” she said.
At the time, Hussain suggested that her shows were axed because she no longer fit the corporation’s “very neat box”.
“I can’t see why there’s a reason why my show wasn’t recommissioned,” she told We Need to Talk podcast, adding that she believes she simply “no longer fit that space anymore”.
“To be fair, I’m not comfortable in boxes anyway,” she said. “I prefer a glass ceiling to smash through, thank you very much. But I suppose there’s no space for me and and and I’m kind of alright with that.”
A spokesperson for the broadcaster said at the time: “After several wonderful series we have made the difficult decision not to commission another cookery show with Nadiya Hussain at the moment.”
They noted that Hussain is still “a much-valued part of the BBC family”.

Rebuked by Supreme Court, Trump touches limit of his power

For once, US President Donald Trump did not allow the press to attend his address to governors at the White House on the morning of Friday, February 20. His outburst of anger happened behind closed doors when he learned about the Supreme Court's decision to strike down much of his tariff policy. By midday, in the press room, Trump doubled down, lashing out at the three liberal and three conservative justices who formed an unusual majority against him. "They are very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution," Trump said, calling the ruling a "disgrace" and an "embarrassment to their families."
On April 2, 2025, the US administration had unveiled sweeping reciprocal tariffs, on what it called "Liberation Day." That has now been nullified. The president has been stripped of his favorite tool for exerting pressure, punishment and blackmail, which he had wielded repeatedly over the past year, including against neighboring countries like Mexico and Canada.
With a somber expression, Trump read a prepared statement, then took questions for 45 minutes, never clearly explaining what "powerful alternatives" he would use to preserve tariffs and bring "a lot of money" into federal coffers. "Foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years are ecstatic," he said. "They are so happy. And they're dancing in the streets, but they won't be dancing for long."

Russia accuses Telegram of aiding Ukraine intelligence

The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) on Saturday accused Telegram of providing information to Ukraine’s military and intelligence.
The FSB claimed in a statement that it has evidence that Ukraine’s intelligence had access to communications of the Russian military and used it against them.
"The Federal Security Service has reliable data indicating that the armed forces and special services of Ukraine are capable of quickly obtaining information posted on the Telegram messenger and using it for military purposes," the statement read.
The FSB further said that the use of Telegram by Russian servicemen in the area of the combat zone over the past three months has led to threats to their lives.
"As a result of analysing the work of the Telegram messenger, numerous reliable data were obtained showing that its use by servicemen of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the area of the special military operation during the last three months repeatedly resulted in creating life-threatening situations for soldiers," it said.
The Russian authorities started slowing down the work of Telegram in December. In early February, they shortly limited access to the app on Russia’s territory, but following many complaints from the military, they lifted restrictions.
Since 2019, Russia banned access to several social media platforms and apps on its territory, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and WhatsApp.

Tragedy on both sides as words are weaponised

Tragedy on both sides as words are weaponised
I appreciated Danny Berkovic’s article and I agree that words can be weaponised and Israel has a right to exist (“How ‘Zionist’ became a safe word for Jew hatred”, February 15). Sadly, under the current Israeli government’s actions, Israel has gone from having massive international sympathy and support after the horrors of October 7, 2023 to horror about its destruction of Gaza and the murder of innocents. I hoped that he may at least acknowledge that Israel’s own actions have stoked the fires of antisemitism to levels never before seen in Australia. That is our current conundrum: tragedy on both sides and so little hope or vision for a just outcome giving the Palestinian people a state for themselves. Rhyan Andrews, Faulconbridge
Danny Berkovic writes that Zionism is simply “the Jewish people’s right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland”. That definition is neat. It is also historically incomplete. Modern political Zionism emerged in late 19th-century Europe with the explicit aim of establishing a Jewish state in a land that was already inhabited. In 1897, when the First Zionist Congress met in Basel, the overwhelming majority of the population of Palestine was Arab – Muslim and Christian – living in established towns, villages and farming communities. Jewish sovereignty there could not be realised without altering that demographic reality. In 1948, that alteration occurred through war and mass displacement. More than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled in fear. Over 400 villages were depopulated or destroyed. Antisemitism is real and must be opposed without qualification. But that truth does not erase another. Zionism is a state-building movement whose realisation entailed – and continues to entail – the removal and dispossession of Palestinians. Criticising Zionism is not hatred of Jews, but a political stance grounded in documented history. Fernanda Trecenti, Fitzroy (Vic)
The problem with Danny Berkovic’s argument regarding Zionism is that his “simple” definition does not take into account the history of Israel after 1948 and, more particularly, 1967, when the Six-Day War tripled Israel’s size. Since then, Zionism has become inextricably linked to Israeli expansionism and the flouting of international law, making it quite a big call to conflate antisemitism with anti-Zionism, and to suggest, as he does, that it is disingenuous to separate the two. Alynn Pratt, Grenfell
Seek source to beat bullying
Hats off to Professor Donna Cross and NSW Education Minister Prue Car for coming up with the most advanced policies for countering bullying in schools that I’ve ever encountered (“‘Safe zone’: Ambitious plan to stamp out bullying”, February 15). This is a great first step in countering the persistent problem of school bullying. But it also raises the question: where does this bullying tendency in children originate? The enlightened approach described above is a welcome first step in what is one of the most vexing problems here in Australia – domestic violence. Larry Woldenberg, Forest Lodge
Again teachers are expected to bear the burden of implementing a revised anti-bullying program in the classroom (“Create a culture of kindness in our schools”, February 15). Are our expectations of how much teachers can influence our children unrealistic? How on earth are teachers expected to educate our children with an already overloaded curriculum, having to keep up to date with the complexity of the digital age, and manage disruptive children? A more successful outcome (and desperately needed) would be to have a qualified counsellor attached to every school. Christina Foo, Wahroonga
Barracks bipartisanship
How gratifying it was to read the article by Alexandra Smith (“Cross-party push to keep barracks in public hands”, February 15). It appears to take an issue of national significance to get political parties and independents to row in the same direction. I wish this diverse group every success in preventing the sale. Paul Reid, Campsie
Taylor’s turn-off
That the new Liberal leader Angus Taylor is reportedly poised to bring back exiled conservative figures Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to frontline politics (“Taylor eyes new team with Hastie, Price on frontbench”, February 15) could very well prompt more moderate Liberal voters to switch their allegiances to the teals. Eric Palm, Gympie (Qld)
I would suggest that the Liberal Party has three existential challenges, not two, as per Parnell Palme McGuinness’ article (“Twin challenges await new leader”, February 15). They are: the teals to the left, One Nation to the right and, third, who the hell are they? Because who is the Liberal Party? They don’t know; we, the voters don’t know; and their prolonged infighting confirms the confusion. I don’t believe they actually have any political “ground” to stand in. The real Menzies Liberal Party is now the teals, and in desperation, the Liberals have reverted to the past reliable formula: a conservative, middle-aged white male who will paternalistically save the country. Meanwhile, their party is a rubber ducky spinning around the political vortex, soon to disappear through the reality plughole, never to be seen again. Rowan Godwin, Rozelle

Families leave Islamic State camp in Syria amid repatriations

A camp in Syria that held families of Islamic State members is nearly empty after repatriations
A camp in northeastern Syria that had housed families of suspected members of the Islamic State group is now largely empty after hundreds of women and children were repatriated to their countries or transferred to other facilities in recent weeks, officials said Friday.
The repatriation to Iraq is part of Syrian government efforts to have suspected IS militants and their family members — held in various camps since the extremist group's was defeated in Syria in 2019 — returned to their countries of origin.
Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the UN refugee agency’s representative in Syria, said in a statement that his agency had assisted in the return of 191 Iraqi citizens from Syria’s al-Hol camp to Iraq on Thursday.
“With this repatriation, and with today’s return of several vulnerable Syrian families supported by UNHCR and partners, Al‑Hol camp will now be practically empty,” he said.
A Syrian government official also said that about 600 Syrians were moved from al-Hol to Akhtarin camp in northwestern Aleppo province, with transfers ongoing.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said the decision to empty the al-Hol camp was made because of its remote location in the desert — far from services and close to areas where the authorities do not have complete control of the territory.
After the defeat of IS in 2019, around 73,000 people were living at al-Hol, most of them Syrian and Iraqi citizens but also including thousands from other countries. The camp’s residents are mostly women, including wives or widows of IS members, and their children.
Since then, the number has declined with some countries repatriating their citizens, leaving about 24,000 last month. It's not clear how many are there still after large numbers fled during a struggle over control of the camp and after the latest repatriations and transfers.
The camp’s residents are not technically prisoners and most have not been accused of crimes, but they have been held in de facto detention at the heavily guarded facility.
A decade ago, at the height of its power, IS had captured wide swaths of land that stretched across a third of Syria and Iraq, territory where the extremists established their so-called caliphate. Hundreds of jihadis from foreign countries traveling to Syria to join the IS. Over the years, they had families and raised children there.
Last month, Syrian government forces captured the al-Hol camp in a weekslong offensive against the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, which had been running the camp near the border with Iraq for a decade. A ceasefire deal has since ended the fighting.
During the fighting, many families are believed to have escaped from the camp.
Save the Children said in a statement Thursday that around 70% of the camp’s residents left the camp in recent weeks. The nongovernmental organization said it had long advocated safe repatriation from al-Hol, where "conditions are dire, with a lack of food, water, and widespread violence.”
It urged for the international community to support the repatriation process.
In a related development, Syrian authorities turned back a group of 34 Australian women and children on Monday after they left Roj camp — similar to al-Hol and also in northeastern Syria. Australian authorities later said they would not repatriate the families.
Separately, the U.S. military has transported thousands of IS militants who were previously held for years in prisons or detention camps in Syria to Iraq, where they will be put on trial.

Russian Strikes Hit More Ukrainian Power Facilities, Several People Wounded

A Ukrainian aerial attack on a Russian region some 1,900 kilometers from the border wounded at least 11 people, as Ukraine's military claimed it targeted a weapons factory there with new long-range cruise missile.
Officials in the central region of Udmurtia said some of those wounded were hospitalized in the attack, which they said involved Ukrainian drones targeting an unnamed facility.
Ukraine's military, however, said the facility was the Votkinsk factory, a sprawling complex where several major Russian weapons systems are manufactured including Yars, Iskander, and Oreshnik missiles.
Video posted to several Telegram channels also purported to show fire and smoke at the Votkinsk factory.
In a post to Telegram, the military also claimed the factory was hit using a new long-range cruise missile called the Flamingo. The missile, which first started appearing last year, is being developed by the Ukrainian company Fire Point.
The company's chief designer published a video on February 20 showing a launch of the missile with the caption: "Here's a short video. No context. Context later."
Military experts are cautious about the Flamingo's abilities, but Ukrainian officials, who have begged Western allies for cruise missiles like Tomahawks and Storm Shadows, are hoping to ramp up production of the homegrown weapon to increase their ability to hit targets deep in Russia.
Russia, meanwhile, pounded Ukraine's Black Sea city of Odesa overnight, hitting a power facility, while launching scores of drones and missile at targets across the country. At least two people were injured in the barrage.
A Russian drone hit a school building, while another drone slammed into a power generating substation, according to private energy company DTEK.
Officials said at least two people were wounded.
In the northeast city of Sumy, Russian strikes hit a residential district, injuring an elderly woman and two children, police officials said.
The overnight attacks came two days after the latest round of US-brokered peace talks wrapped up in Geneva with no breakthrough to end the Russian invasion, which hits its four-year mark on February 24.
Russia has shown no willingness to bend from its hard-line demands, which include Ukraine withdrawing from eastern territories it currently holds and blocking Kyiv's request for binding security guarantees.
Amid unusually cold winter temperatures, Russia has repeatedly hit power and heating facilities in Kyiv and throughout the country, leaving millions of Ukrainians struggling to stay warm and go about their lives.
Kyiv's mayor has said hundreds of thousands have fled the city, as emergency workers struggle to repair damaged facilities.

Macron urges calm ahead of rally for slain activist
February 21, 2026French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of a rally Saturday in Lyon for a far-right activist whose killing has deepened political tensions.
Quentin Deranque was fatally beaten by a group of attackers on the sidelines of a protest against the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party last week.
Macron urged "everyone to remain calm" ahead of a rally for Deranque in Lyon, which is going ahead under tight security despite the mayor's call to ban it.
The rally is expected to draw up to 3,000 people, with counterprotests also anticipated.
On Friday, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said he had planned an "extremely large police deployment," with reinforcements from outside the city to ensure security at the rally.
French government to discuss 'violent action groups'
At least 11 people have been detained in connection with the killing, one of them is reportedly an assistant to a hard-left member of parliament.
The case has strained tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race.
France's far-right National Rally (RN) urged supporters to avoid rallies on Saturday but the party also has cast the hard left as the real danger to France. LFI has condemned the killing.
Deranque's death also drew sharp reactions abroad. The US State Department described it as "terrorism" and blamed rising "violent radical leftism," while Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the killing "a wound for all Europe," prompting Macron to tell her to stay out of French affairs.
The government will convene a meeting next week on "violent action groups which are active and have links with political parties," as investigations continue.
"In the Republic, no violence is legitimate," Macron said Saturday. "There is no place for militias, no matter where they come from."

Cuban security forces exit Venezuela as US pressure mounts

CARACAS, Feb 21 - Cuban security advisers and doctors have been leaving Venezuela as Interim President Delcy Rodriguez's government faces intense pressure from Washington to unwind Latin America’s most consequential leftist alliance, according to 11 sources familiar with the matter.
Venezuela’s Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has entrusted her protection to Venezuelan bodyguards, according to four of the sources, unlike deposed president Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor, the late president Hugo Chavez, who both relied on elite Cuban forces.
Thirty-two Cubans were killed in the U.S. military attack that captured Maduro on January 3, according to the Cuban government. These soldiers and bodyguards were part of a deep security agreement between Caracas and Havana that began in the late 2000s in which Cuban intelligence agents embedded throughout the military and Venezuela’s formidable DGCIM counterintelligence unit, which was fundamental to weeding out domestic opposition.
“The Cuban influence was absolutely essential” to the survival of the Chavista government, said Alejandro Velasco, an associate professor of history at New York University and an expert on Venezuela.
Inside DGCIM, some Cuban advisers have been removed from their posts, according to a former Venezuela intelligence official. Some of the Cuban medical workers and security advisers have travelled from Venezuela to Cuba on flights in recent weeks, two of the sources said.
One source close to Venezuela’s ruling party said the Cubans were departing on the orders of Rodriguez due to U.S. pressure. The other sources were not clear on whether the Cubans were being forced to leave by the new Venezuelan leadership, departing of their own accord, or being summoned home by Havana.
The decision to sideline Cubans from the presidential guard and the counterintelligence unit has not been previously reported.
TRUMP WANTS END TO VENEZUELA-CUBA TIES
Prior to the operation to remove Maduro, thousands of Cuban doctors, nurses and sports coaches worked in Venezuela as part of welfare programs begun under Chavez. In exchange, Venezuela provided Cuba with a source of much-needed oil.
Following the U.S. attack, U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to end the security relationship between Venezuela and Cuba. “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!,” he wrote on Truth Social on January 11.
In response to questions about U.S. pressure on Venezuela to cut ties with Cuba, a White House official said the U.S. has “a very good relationship with the leaders of Venezuela” and that it believes that Rodriguez’s “own self-interest aligns with advancing our key objectives.”
Severing Venezuela’s relationship with Cuba is part of Washington’s broader strategy of toppling Havana’s communist-run government. Since mid-December, Washington has blockaded Venezuela from shipping oil to Cuba, economically strangling the island.
The U.S. government is “talking to Cuba, whose leaders should make a deal,” the official said.
The Cuban government has said it is open to dialogue on equal terms, while condemning the oil blockade and vowing to resist U.S. intervention.
Neither the Cuban nor Venezuelan governments responded to requests for comment. The two countries have publicly affirmed their continued relationship.
Rodriguez, the daughter of a former Marxist guerrilla, has been a longtime ally of Maduro and member of Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party. She’s also personally close to the Cuban government, according to ten U.S. and Venezuelan sources.
On January 8, Rodriguez appeared alongside Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez at a flower-laden memorial service in Caracas for the victims of the U.S. attack.
“To the brave Venezuelan people, we express Cuba’s deepest solidarity,” Bruno Rodriguez said at the event, before uttering the rallying cry of one of the leaders of the Cuban revolution, Ernesto “Che” Guevara: “Hasta la victoria siempre.”
Later in January, Delcy Rodriguez also spoke by phone with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, saying afterwards that the two countries remained “united.” Diaz-Canel, after the same call, said Cuba was committed to “continue strengthening the historic relations of brotherhood and cooperation.”
Regarding the relationship between the two countries, the White House official said: “President Trump understands that they have to make certain statements for domestic political reasons.”
FLIGHTS BACK TO CUBA
A source familiar with the Cuban government’s thinking said that some military personnel injured in the U.S. attack have returned to Cuba, but that others have remained active in Venezuela. The source also said many Cuban doctors continue to provide care in Venezuela.
Cuba’s state-run media in early January said a suspension of commercial flights and closure of Venezuelan airspace had caused a backlog that prevented Cuba from bringing home doctors from vacations or for ending their missions in Venezuela. Those flights resumed the week after the January 3 U.S. attack, those reports said.
A U.S. source familiar with the matter said that while the Cuban presence is diminishing, some undercover intelligence agents are likely to remain in the country to see how the political situation pans out.
Frank Mora, who served as U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States under the Biden administration, said “Rodriguez is treading very carefully.”
“She wants to keep the Cubans at a distance until this situation calms down, until her hold on power is clear, but not entirely throw them under the bus, either,” Mora said.
At least some Cuban military advisers are still working in Venezuela, four sources familiar with the matter said. Cuban professors also continue to teach at the state university for police and security forces, known as UNES, according to a former police officer.
John Polga-Hecimovich, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland who has studied the role of Cuban security advisers in Venezuela, said the legacy of the Cuban counterintelligence effort is still evident in Caracas, where Maduro’s top loyalists remain in power.
“The Cubans didn’t manage to protect Maduro, but they played a key role in keeping the Chavista government in power," Polga-Hecimovich said. “The coup-proofing worked brilliantly.” REUTERS

Most powerful warship in the world heading to Iran

The U.S. Navy’s newest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford, has transited the Strait of Gibraltar and is heading east after recently operating in the Caribbean, positioning the world’s largest and most advanced warship closer to the Middle East amid rising tensions with Iran.
The 100,000-ton nuclear-powered carrier had been conducting operations in the Caribbean in recent weeks before shifting course across the Atlantic. Her passage through Gibraltar signals a clear repositioning toward the Mediterranean and, potentially, the U.S. Central Command theatre.
USS Gerald R. Ford is the lead ship of the Ford-class and represents the most technologically advanced carrier ever built. At 337 metres long with a flight deck spanning more than four acres, she is powered by two A1B nuclear reactors that provide virtually unlimited range and significantly greater electrical output than previous Nimitz-class ships. That additional power supports advanced systems across the ship and future upgrades.
The carrier is designed to embark an air wing of more than 75 aircraft, including F-35C Lightning II stealth fighters, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, E-2D Advanced Hawkeyes and MH-60 helicopters. Her Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System replaces traditional steam catapults, enabling smoother launches and reduced stress on airframes, while Advanced Arresting Gear improves aircraft recovery. Together, these systems are intended to generate higher sortie rates than earlier carriers.
Defensively, the ship is equipped with the AN/SPY-3 radar as part of the Dual Band Radar suite, along with Close-In Weapon Systems and Rolling Airframe Missiles to counter incoming threats. She operates at speeds exceeding 30 knots and sails as the centrepiece of a carrier strike group that typically includes guided missile destroyers and cruisers, along with a fast attack submarine.
The Ford-class was designed to reduce crew size compared with previous carriers, relying on greater automation and redesigned internal systems to lower lifecycle costs. Despite this, the ship still carries a complement of roughly 4,500 sailors and air wing personnel when fully embarked. Her movement eastwards places a significant concentration of U.S. naval air power within reach of the Middle East.

Malaysia’s tuberculosis cases rise to above 3,000, health ministry flags risks
Higher social interaction during the month of Ramadan may increase exposure risks, the ministry says
In a statement issued on Saturday, the ministry said a total of 596 new TB cases were reported nationwide during the sixth epidemiological week.
“Crowded, enclosed and poorly ventilated spaces increase the risk of transmission, especially if an individual with untreated active TB is present. Ramadan itself is not a cause of TB transmission. However, higher social interaction during the month may increase exposure risks,” the statement added.
The ministry stressed that community awareness and proactive measures are key to early detection, effective treatment and prevention of TB spread.
“With collective action, we can ensure a safe and healthy Ramadan for all.
“Unlike influenza or Covid-19, TB spreads more slowly and usually requires prolonged and repeated exposure,” the statement added.

US ambassador Mike Huckabee backs Israel taking ‘all the Middle East’
US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has said it would be “fine if they took it all” when asked whether Israel has the right to control land stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates, invoking an alleged biblical promise.
In a two-hour interview with right-wing US commentator Tucker Carlson published on Friday, Huckabee cited Genesis 15, in which God promises Abraham land "from the River of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates".
Carlson, who has become a vocal critic of Israel, noted that in modern geographical terms, that area would include "basically the entire Middle East" - naming Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and large parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
"I’m not sure it would go that far, but it would be a big piece of land," Huckabee replied.
However, pressed directly on whether Israel has the right to that territory, he said: "It would be fine if they took it all," before adding that Israel is not seeking such expansion and had given up land in the past, including the Sinai Peninsula, which it illegally seized from Egypt in 1967.
Huckabee framed his position in explicitly theological terms.
"Israel is a land that God gave, through Abraham, to a people that he chose. It was a people, a place and a purpose," he claimed. He also argued that the US must "bless Israel" if it wishes to receive God’s blessing, citing the biblical passage that says God "blesses those who bless Israel and curses those who curse Israel".
The former Arkansas governor, who is also an evangelical Southern Baptist pastor and proud Christian Zionist, endorses a controversial reading of scripture that treats the modern State of Israel as the direct heir to biblical promises.
Some Arab commentators have previously accused Israel of seeking to seize all the land between the Nile and the Euphrates, but this is the first time a US official has openly endorsed such a proposal.
Such Biblical interpretations are contested by many Christian leaders across the world.
Throughout the exchange, Carlson repeatedly challenged Huckabee’s claims about Israel's supposed divine right to the land, questioning whether biblical promises could form the basis of modern statehood and whether such reasoning would apply to other nations.
He also pressed Huckabee on the definition of Jewish identity and on the legal foundations of Israel’s establishment, disputing the suggestion that the 1917 Balfour Declaration issued by Britain constituted international law.
Huckabee’s remarks have put the spotlight on the concept of "Greater Israel" - a concept associated with certain interpretations of biblical borders. For years, Palestinians and critics of Israeli policy who have warned of expansionist ambitions have often been accused of promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories.
Expansionist visions however exist within strands of religious Jewish Zionism and Christian Zionism, and they have been articulated by senior Israeli political figures.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has openly advocated territorial expansion based on Jewish scripture. In an interview for the Arte documentary 'Israel: Extremists in Power', Smotrich said: "It is written that the future of Jerusalem is to expand to Damascus."
He added that a Jewish state, in his view, should extend into Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
Calls for annexation and expanding Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank have also become increasingly mainstream within Israel’s current governing coalition.
Huckabee was appointed as US ambassador to Israel by President Donald Trump.
His comments are likely to prompt questions about his suitability for a diplomatic post that traditionally requires alignment with established US policy and international law, while also highlighting the Trump administration’s continued pro-Israel stance.

Decline in remote jobs risks shutting disabled people out of work, study finds
Unknown

A decline in the number of jobs for people who need to work remotely, including those with disabilities, could undermine the government’s efforts to reverse rising unemployment, according to a two-year study.
More than eight in 10 respondents to a survey of working-age disabled people by researchers at Lancaster University said access to home working was essential or very important when looking for a new job.
Almost half (46%) of the participants in the Inclusive Remote and Hybrid Working Study wanted to work remotely all the time, with disabled women and disabled carers more likely to want to work fully from home.
The needs of disabled job applicants run against the trend for employers to reduce hybrid and remote working, the study found.
Analysis of Adzuna job vacancy data showed declining levels of remote job opportunities. In the financial year 2024-25, only one in 23 job adverts on Adzuna (4.3%) were fully remote – half the level seen during the pandemic peak of 8.7% in 2020-21.
“Growth in the availability of hybrid jobs appears to have stalled, with only one in seven (13.5%) job vacancies offering hybrid work in 2024-25,” the report said.
The findings followed official job figures earlier this week covering the three months to December, which showed one in 11 disabled people were unemployed (9.2%), double the 4.4% average.
The Office for National Statistics found there were 547,000 unemployed disabled people, an increase of 110,000 since the same period in 2024.
“Unemployment has risen across the UK economy in the last 12 months, but analysis indicates that the rate has risen far more quickly for disabled people than non-disabled people,” said the Work Foundation, a thinktank based at Lancaster University, which coordinated the remote-working project with Manchester Metropolitan University.
Billed as the largest study of disabled workers’ experiences of remote and hybrid work in the UK, with funding from the Nuffield Foundation, it involved interviews with more than 1,200 disabled people.
The report said that while remote and hybrid working remain more common than before the pandemic, the proportion of fully remote roles had fallen, and the rate of growth in hybrid jobs had slowed.
It found that 64% of fully remote disabled workers said their work pattern positively affected their physical health, compared with 31% of those working remotely less than half the time.
There was also demand for hybrid working from a quarter of respondents who wanted to work from home four days a week and 27% for three days or fewer.
Only a tiny fraction – 1.6% – wanted to stop working from home.
One of the respondents, Vera, who is in her 20s and works for a healthcare company in London, said she was based at home following stem cell treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS).
She was unable to return to a frontline role. “Remote work has made it possible for me to stay in employment – without it I couldn’t work,” she said.
“While I’ve reduced my hours to four days a week, working from home means I can manage cognitive fatigue and rest during lunch breaks so I can stay productive.
“But I feel stuck, as there are so few remote-only roles. These are realistically the only roles I can apply for if I want to keep working and progress in my career.”
A recent study by the Work Foundation and the MS Society found that nearly half of people with MS (47%) look for job locations that require little or no travel.
Lead researcher Paula Holland said: “The increased availability of remote and hybrid working since before the pandemic has improved many disabled people’s experience of work. Our findings indicate disabled employees gain significant benefits including improved mental and physical health, better work-life balance and increased productivity.
“However, companies mandating people to return to the office have seen remote-only opportunities plummet and this could prevent some disabled workers from returning and staying in work. At a time when the government wants to get people working, disabled workers report that access to suitable home-working roles can be the difference between working or not working.”
A recent House of Lords report called for ministers to ensure remote and hybrid working is being prioritised to boost disabled people’s employment.

‘Dictator vibes’ as dear leader Trump puts name and face front and center

You wouldn’t be alone if you feel that the US more closely resembles North Korea these days – with giant images of the dear leader scowling down on the citizenry, and his name inscribed everywhere from public buildings to street signs, transportation hubs and self-aggrandizing monuments.
Thursday’s unfurling of a massive banner bearing the visage of Donald J Trump, the 47th US president, on the exterior of the Washington headquarters of the federal justice department was only the latest example of how he has imposed himself on every facet of American life. Some critics have called it “dictator vibes”.
Trump’s mighty persona, it seems, cannot be escaped. And it cannot be ignored. Here’s a look at the some of the places where the president has made himself omnipresent, or seeks to, since his return to office last year:
Public buildings
Places where people congregate in numbers, or at least used to, are top of Trump’s list to get his face, and name, seen.
The most prominent example is the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, inaugurated in 1971 as a “living memorial” to the assassinated president but hijacked by Trump cronies who quickly installed him as the leader of its board. Ticket sales crumbled, artists walked away, and it was announced earlier in February that the venue would close for two years for “refurbishment”. In December, Trump added his own name to the center – illegally in the view of critics, including Kennedy’s relatives.
The US Institute of Peace was an early victim of Trump’s second-term Doge (department of government efficiency) drive to cut perceived wasteful government spending. Similar to the Kennedy Center takeover, the previous board was ousted, and its Washington headquarters became a shell of its former self after most staff were fired. In December, the engravers moved in, and Trump’s name was chiselled into the institute’s wall.
Giant banners of Trump’s face almost identical to the recent justice department installation were erected at the Department of Agriculture and at the labor department last year.
Public transportation
Florida state legislature Republicans on Tuesday voted to rename the airport in West Palm Beach, where the president flies frequently between the White House and his private Mar-a-Lago club, the “President Donald J Trump International Airport”. Just days previously, the Trump Organization applied to trademark the name, opening the door to lucrative merchandising opportunities and taxpayer-funded licensing agreements, although the company insisted it was not seeking to profit from the move.
Between the airport and Mar-a-Lago, the president is driven across a section of road newly renamed President Donald J Trump Boulevard, formerly plain old Southern Boulevard, in another act of fealty by Florida’s Republican-dominated legislature.
Trump also has designs on other transportation hubs. New York’s Penn Station is said to be his prime target. And recent reports suggested he would unfreeze billions of dollars in federal funding for a major infrastructure project in the north-east only if the Democratic US Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, supported his efforts to rename the railroad station and Washington’s Dulles international airport after himself.
US military
One of the president’s most frequent boasts is how he has “rebuilt” the US military into a leaner, meaner fighting machine. As part of this perceived revival, it was announced in December that a new “golden fleet” of warships known as Trump-class destroyers would be commissioned, complete with hypersonic weapons, high-power lasers and nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles.
Sports facilities
The Washington Commanders’ new $3.7bn, 65,000-seat domed stadium, set to open in 2030, will be named Trump Stadium – if the White House gets its way. “It’s what the president wants, and it will probably happen,” a presidential administration official told ESPN, insisting that Trump was responsible for getting the project off the ground because the stadium is being built on land controlled by the National Park Service.
Public monuments
It hasn’t happened yet, but Trump’s face could one day get carved into the face of Mount Rushmore, the South Dakota memorial to four presidents of the past: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Proposed legislation by the sycophantic Florida Republican congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna last year went nowhere. But the site has long been on Trump’s radar, even before his controversial independence day speech and divisive fireworks there in 2020.
The president’s most recent monumental wheeze, meanwhile, is a plan for a 250ft arch: a so-called Arc de Trump, to be built on land adjacent to the Potomac River in Washington DC. Critics say the project exudes “dictator for life” vibes – while Trump himself has portrayed it as a crucial ingredient of domestic policy.
Finance
If the word Obamacare became synonymous with his predecessor’s signature health care achievements, Trump aims to emulate the success of name-branding with Trump accounts, a forthcoming savings initiative for new parents. Any baby born before 31 December 2028 will receive a $1,000 head start from the Trump administration in a venture critics say will become another tax-shelter for already wealthy American families while excluding children born to immigrants.

Epstein files place renewed attention on US authorities’ failure to stop him

The Department of Justice’s release of millions of Jeffrey Epstein files has not only prompted questions about his crimes – but renewed attention on authorities’ failure to stop him after an accuser reported him in 1996.
This new cache of Epstein files has provided more insight into authorities’ familiarity with allegations against him in the years that followed, including time between his sweetheart plea deal in 2008 and federal arrest nearly six years ago.
While it’s known that accuser Virginia Giuffre’s attorneys met with federal prosecutors in 2016 about Epstein to no avail, recently disclosed files indicate that detailed information was provided to federal authorities years before that sit-down. This included allegations against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor; documents indicate that he appeared on the FBI’s radar about 15 years ago.
A woman, whose name is redacted from these documents, gave an interview to FBI agents about Epstein and Maxwell in 2011, with a federal prosecutor in attendance by phone; her account echoes Giuffre’s public and legal allegations against the sex traffickers.
The US embassy in Australia told the country’s national police: “The Federal Bureau of Investigation Miami Field Office (FBI Miami) is assisting the Palm Beach Police Department in Florida with an ongoing investigation into JEFFREY EPSTEIN, a US citizen.”
The accuser, who was told in late 2008 about Epstein’s plea deal as she was found to be one of his victims, contacted federal authorities in south Florida three years later. Federal agents questioned her at the US consulate in Sydney on 17 March 2011.
This woman provided an extensive account of Epstein’s abuse and alleged participation of co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as other men as a teenage girl during the late 1990s. The woman, who described suffering at the hands of several predatory men after leaving a rehab facility, told agents that her father, a maintenance man at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, secured a job for her as a locker room attendant there.
The woman, then an aspiring massage therapist, was reading a book on this subject. Maxwell came up to her and claimed she was looking for a traveling masseuse.
Not long after, the woman traveled to Epstein’s Palm Beach home, where he abused her. She told agents she ultimately traveled and that the sexual abuse continued and that he trafficked her to other men.
Giuffre, who died by suicide last spring, had long alleged that Epstein and Maxwell made her engage in sexual activity with the former Duke of York, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The former prince, who was removed from royal life over his relationship with Epstein, was arrested on Thursday in England; he has staunchly denied wrongdoing.
Maxwell, who was found guilty of luring teenage girls into Epstein’s predatory orbit, has insisted on her innocence. Epstein died in jail while awaiting his sex-trafficking trial in 2019.
FBI documents chronicling this interview also detail menacing actions against this woman. She told federal agents about receiving phone calls from men purporting to be FBI agents seeking information about her knowledge of Epstein.
She said that an attorney and Epstein called her by phone a few weeks after these men contacted her, and that he said “if she did not say anything to investigators he would take care of her”.
The release of information regarding this 2011 interview comes as victims and advocates’ continue to show that law enforcement officials repeatedly had opportunities to meaningfully hold Epstein and Maxwell accountable before his 2019 arrest. The chronology makes clear that had Epstein been interdicted, others would not have suffered abuse.
Maria Farmer, a painter who worked for Epstein in 1996, filed a report with the FBI stating that he “stole” nude images of her siblings. This FBI report states that Farmer took artistic photos of her younger sisters for her personal work.
“Epstein Stole the photos and Negatives and is believed to have sold the pictures to potential buyers,” the report said.
The document also said that Epstein asked for “pictures of young girls at swimming pools” and threatened Farmer, stating “that if she tells anyone about the photos he will burn her house down”.
Epstein did serve a brief period of time in a Palm Beach jail on Florida state-level prostitution charges, including procuring someone under 18, under his sweetheart plea deal. He was granted work release.
Officials said that Epstein abused others between this plea deal, which allowed him to avoid federal prosecution, and his arrest years later. One adult victim alleged she was abused at Epstein’s office during this daytime furlough.
The Virgin Islands sued Epstein’s estate in January 2020 stating that flight logs from 2011 to 2019 show that he brought underage girls and young women to his private island “where they were deceptively subjected to sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and forced labor”.
“As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing Epstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age of 11 and 18 years,” the lawsuit states. The Virgin Islands that “Epstein trafficked and abused these girls, and others, in the Virgin Islands through 2018.”
Spencer Kuvin, who did not represent Giuffre but is an attorney for multiple Epstein victims, questioned why federal agents did not take action following the 2011 interview.
“If that information was credible – and there is every reason to believe it was – then the obvious question is why meaningful action did not follow,”said Kuvin, of Goldlaw. “Survivors did their part. They spoke. When institutions fail to act on those disclosures, the system – not the victims – must answer for that.
“It is deeply troubling. Survivors like Virginia showed extraordinary courage in coming forward,” he also said. “The lack of urgency is institutional. Accountability must include examining why those opportunities were missed.”
Asked what transpired following the 2011 interview, the FBI said it “declines to comment”. The justice department did not immediately respond to a question about what happened after that interview.

Does Nigel Farage have a problem with women?

When Nigel Farage told a journalist this week she should “write some silly story … and we won’t bother to read it”, it provoked an instant – and divided – reaction. For some it was a “masterclass” in dealing with mainstream media, but for others it was “rude, dismissive, misogynistic, arrogant”.
Behind the scenes, Farage’s treatment of the Financial Times’s Anna Gross – which was met with mirth and applause among Reform diehards in the room – provoked disquiet and anger among lobby journalists across the political spectrum.
As the Reform UK leader was leaving the event, a Guardian political reporter suggested he had been rude and had upset the journalist. “Good,” Farage responded.
It is not the first time Farage has been accused of patronising a female journalist. When the former BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Mishal Husain asked him about the potential consequences of shooting down Russian planes last October, Farage responded: “Listen love, you’re trying ever so hard.” A month later he accused the Telegraph’s Camilla Tominey of playing a “silly little game” when she asked who his chancellor would be.
Amid a busy news cycle, his most recent condescension could have been easily forgotten. But in a week where Farage hired a hardline anti-abortion theologian as his head of policy and promised to repeal the Equality Act on his party’s first day in government, it has sparked the question: does Reform UK, and its leader in particular, have a women problem?
Jane Martinson, the former chair of Women in Journalism, said the run-ins with female journalists were a clear example of Donald Trump’s influence.
“Nigel Farage is really offering a sort of Trump-lite for the British people, patronising a respected journalist and newspaper because he disagrees with its scrutiny,” she said. “This is all about ignoring the public’s right to know and trying to control your own message by turning on the messenger, especially if they’re just ‘silly’ women.”
Reproductive rights and equality campaigners reacted in horror after Farage hired James Orr, a rightwing theologian who opposes abortion even in cases of rape, incest or serious risk to health, to replace Zia Yusuf as his head of policy. The Cambridge University professor, who heads the Centre for a Better Britain thinktank, is an influential figure in Trump’s administration and is admired by the vice-president, JD Vance, who once described him as his “British sherpa”.
Kerry Abel, the chair of Abortion Rights, said it was “an alarming moment for Britain” and accused Farage of “borrowing tactics from America’s culture wars”, especially in relation to anti-abortion ideology.
The hire came a little over a week after Matt Goodwin, Reform UK’s candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection, was accused of wanting a “Handmaid’s Tale future” after unearthed YouTube footage revealed he had called for “young girls and women” to be given a “biological reality” check.
For Heejung Chung, the director of the King’s Global Institute for Women’s Leadership, Farage’s rhetoric around – and treatment of – women is part of a worrying trend that delegitimises discussion of gender inequality and women’s rights in a way that was “unthinkable” even five years ago.
“It feels like a consistent and deliberate tactic,” she said. “I don’t think it’s that he’s an old-fashioned guy with questionable views, he wants to distract people into thinking their problems are because of women, or equality and diversity policies, or immigrants. Like Trump in America, it shifts the discourse, and that is very dangerous.”
There are signs that Labour, and others on the left, are willing to meet Farage on this battlefield. On Thursday, Keir Starmer said plans to repeal the Equality Act, which gives women extra protection in the workplace, were “shocking” and unBritish, arguing that Reform wanted to send women back to the “old days”.
Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, described the attack on the 2010 legislation as “calculating, playbook, rage-bait politics” and bad economic policy. “The Equality Act gives the labour market more talent, which is good for productivity and good for growth,” she said. “What this is about is saying: ‘Here’s somebody to blame for why the world isn’t fair.’ It is not saying: ‘How do we fix it?’”
Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for a united front against the “nasty thread of misogyny” running through Reform UK. Farage was also a political risk, he said, noting that “Reform have already got a problem with women voters”.
While it is true that Reform voters have skewed heavily male, there has been a shift. In the last election, 61% of voters who voted Reform UK were men, but on voting intention in 2026 that figure had dropped to 55%, according to polling from More In Common.
Luke Tryl, More in Common’s executive director, said there was a “Reform seesaw” among women who expressed support for the party, with those in focus groups voicing concerns about the risk of backing Farage, while also showing interest in the radical change they thought his party could bring.
Farage should be wary of comparisons to the US president, with polling showing that 25% of women considered Farage’s support for Trump as the top reason not to vote Reform, compared with 21% of men.
Farage may also want to consider how he treats journalists at future press conferences. “Rudeness is a sort of thing that people do notice,” Tryl said. “It’s a sort of thing which, if it becomes a pattern, could go down badly. If you think about that seesaw, it’s all weighing down the side which says ‘this is too much of a risk’.”
Asked for comment, a Reform UK spokesperson said: “Nigel Farage treats all journalists equally. Scrutiny is a two-way street.”

Who Has Resigned Over Revelations in the Epstein Files?

A number of high-profile figures have resigned from their positions after new details about their ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were revealed in the latest batch of the so-called “Epstein files” released by the Justice Department.
The more than 3 million pages made public by the department late last month include mentions and photos of prominent people across the worlds of politics, business, academia, art, and entertainment. In some cases, correspondence or other documents included in the files indicate more extensive relationships between Epstein and those figures than had previously been disclosed, shedding light on years’ worth of interactions.
The appearance of someone’s name in the documents is not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing. But the fallout from the latest release has reverberated around the world, leading some people named in the files to step down from their posts, while others have faced increasing calls to do the same.
Here are some of the prominent figures who have resigned from their positions over their ties to Epstein in the weeks since the Justice Department’s most recent drop.
Billionaire heir Thomas Pritzker
Hyatt Hotels heir Thomas Pritzker on Monday resigned his post as the executive chairman of the hotel company—a position he has held for more than two decades.
The latest batch of documents released by the Justice Department include a number of emails that Pritzker exchanged with Epstein and Epstein’s longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2021 for conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. Some of the messages involve Pritzker and Epstein—sometimes via their assistants—discussing plans to meet for dinner. Correspondence between the two men continued even after Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea to soliciting prostitution from a minor, the files released by the government show.
In a statement, reported by multiple media outlets, Pritzker said that he regrets his ties to Epstein and Maxwell.
“I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,” Pritzker said. “I condemn the actions and the harm caused by Epstein and Maxwell and I feel deep sorrow for the pain they inflicted on their victims.”
Authorities have not accused Pritzker of any wrongdoing.
The Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced in a press release on Monday that Pritzker was retiring as executive chairman, effective immediately. The company added that Pritzker will not be seeking re-election to the Board of Directors. Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt’s president and CEO, is succeeding Pritzker as chairman of the board, also effective immediately. The press release didn’t mention Pritzker’s ties to Epstein and Maxwell.
“I have been a proud member of the Hyatt family since the beginning of Hyatt,” Pritzker, a cousin of Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, said in the press release. “It has been both an honor and one of the great experiences of my life to have contributed to Hyatt’s growth.”
Top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathy Ruemmler
Kathy Ruemmler announced last week that she was stepping down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, effective June 30. The news came after the latest Justice Department release made public emails between Ruemmler and Epstein that appeared to show the two maintaining a close relationship years after Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea. In one email, dated October 2018, someone whose name is redacted wrote to Ruemmler that “Jeffrey is sending a couple of things to your NY apartment.” Ruemmler later confirmed that she received the gift, which she wrote was “so lovely and thoughtful!”, adding, “Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!”
Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel to former President Barack Obama, has said that she had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, and has maintained that she never provided Epstein with legal representation. Following the release, Ruemmler called Epstein a “monster.” A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said before Ruemmler’s resignation that Ruemmler “regrets ever knowing him.”
Prior to her announcement last week, she had said that she wouldn’t step down from her post at Goldman Sachs.
“Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do,” she said in her statement, according to The Associated Press. “My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”
DP World Chair and CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem
DP World Limited, one of the largest logistics companies in the world, announced last week that its chairman and CEO, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, had resigned, effective immediately. The company said that Essa Kazim has been appointed to succeed bin Sulayem as chairman, and that Yuvraj Narayan has been appointed to succeed him as CEO. The press release didn’t provide any additional details about the decision, and didn’t mention Epstein.
Bin Sulayem’s name appears many times in the newly released files, which include email correspondence between him and Epstein that appears to show that the two had a yearslong friendship that continued even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. In one email released by the Justice Department, dated June 2013, Epstein wrote to bin Sulayem: “All I know for sure, is that you are one of my most trusted friends in very sense of the word, you have never let me down, not once, not half of once. and I greatly appreciate the time we spend together.” Bin Sulayem responded: “Thank you my friend I am off the sample a fresh 100% female Russian at my yacht.”
U.S. officials have also indicated that bin Sulayem was the recipient of a 2009 email from Epstein in which the late sex offender wrote, “Where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video.” The recipient’s name was redacted in the released files. But after Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky pressed the Department of Justice to make the person’s identity public—saying “A Sultan seems to have sent this”—Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that the name of “the Sultan” appeared unredacted in other files and pointed to a separate email exchange between bin Sulayem and Epstein.
Authorities have not accused bin Sulayem of any wrongdoing.
Paul, Weiss Chairman Brad Karp
Brad Karp—the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, one of the most prestigious law firms in the U.S.—stepped down earlier this month, after email correspondence between him and Epstein was released in the latest batch of files from the Justice Department.
In a statement announcing Karp’s resignation, the firm didn’t explicitly mention Karp’s ties to Epstein. But Karp said in the press release, “Leading Paul, Weiss for the past 18 years has been the honor of my professional life. Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed a focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.”
Karp has practiced at Paul, Weiss for four decades and took on the role of chairman in 2008. While he’s stepping down as chairman, Paul, Weiss said that Karp “will continue to focus his full-time attention to client service at the firm.”
A firm spokesperson told POLITICO before Karp resigned that Paul, Weiss never represented Epstein. A spokesperson said earlier this month that Karp “never witnessed or participated in any misconduct.”
Correspondence in the newly released documents details a yearslong relationship between Karp and Epstein. In one email released by the Justice Department, dated July 2015, Karp thanked Epstein “for including me in an evening I’ll never forget.”
“It was truly ‘once in a lifetime’ in every way, though I hope to be invited again,” Karp said in the email. “You are an extraordinary host – and your home….!!!”
Epstein replied, “you are always welcome. there are many many nights of unique talents. you will be invited often.”
In another email released by the Justice Department, dated March 2019, Karp appears to be discussing a draft court filing from Epstein’s attorneys, in which they argued that Epstein’s 2008 plea deal shouldn’t be reopened.
“The draft motion is in great shape. It’s overwhelmingly persuasive. Truly,” Karp said in his email. “I particularly liked the argument that the ‘victims’ lied in wait and sat on their rights for their strategic advantage, knowing you were in prison, before they came forward.”
Norwegian Ambassador Mona Juul
Mona Juul, a Norwegian ambassador who participated in peace talks between Israel and Palestine in the 1990s, resigned earlier this month after her ties to Epstein generated controversy.
“This is the right and necessary decision,” Minister of Foreign Affairs Espen Barth Eide said in a press release. “Juul’s contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein revealed a serious lapse in judgment. The situation makes it difficult to restore the trust that the role requires.”
The announcement came days after Juul was relieved of her duties as the country’s ambassador to Jordan, amid reports that Epstein left her children $10 million in a will that was drafted before he died in prison in 2019.
Norway’s Foreign MInistry said that it was investigating “Juul’s knowledge of and contact with Epstein” and that the probe would continue after Juul stepped down from her position.
“It’s important to understand the extent of her contact with Epstein in her capacity as an employee of the Ministry,” Eide said in the press release. “Particularly, we need to determine whether the relationship impacted her work as a diplomat.”
Juul’s lawyer told the New York Times in a statement that she “does not recognize the accusations made against her.”
Juul told a Norwegian news agency earlier this month that her interactions with Epstein stemmed from her husband’s relationship with him, and that she didn’t have her own, separate relationship with Epstein, according to the AP. While she said that her interactions with Epstein were not part of her professional duties, she said that she should have exercised more caution.
House of Lords Member Peter Mandelson
Peter Mandelson, a member of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom, stepped down from the Labour Party earlier this month, after his name appeared in the newly released documents multiple times.
The files include bank statements that suggest that Epstein made three payments, totaling $75,000, to accounts tied to Mandelson between 2003 and 2004. The documents also include emails between Mandelson and Epstein, including one from June 2009 in which Mandelson, who was business secretary at the time, appeared to have forwarded a government memo to Epstein.
Mandelson was earlier removed from his role as the U.K.’s ambassador to the U.S. in September, after the nation’s foreign office said that previously released correspondence between Mandelson and Epstein revealed that their relationship was “materially different from that known at the time of his appointment.”
Mandelson has said that he didn’t do anything criminal.
Slovakian minister Miroslav Lajcak
Miroslav Lajcak, the national security adviser to Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico, resigned at the end of January, after his name appeared several times in the latest document drop by the Justice Department.
Text messages and emails in the latest release appear to show Lajcak and Epstein discussing topics including movies, foreign affairs, and women. In one text exchange released by the Justice Department, dated October 2018, Lajcak appears to message an unnamed number, “Regards from Kiev! Just to confirm that girls here are as gorgeous as ever:)”.
Lajcak has denied any wrongdoing and told local media that he stepped down from his post so that Fico wouldn’t have to bear the political costs of the blowback Lajcak was receiving.
Arab World Institute in Paris head Jack Lang
Jack Lang said earlier this month that he was stepping down from his position as the head of the Arab World Institute, a Paris cultural organization. The announcement came amid allegations that Lang had financial ties to Epstein, which have led French authorities to launch an investigation into him.
Lang, formerly France’s culture minister, was mentioned in the Epstein files hundreds of times. The documents released by the Justice Department revealed that he and Epstein corresponded even after Epstein’s 2008 guilty plea. French prosecutors said they were investigating Lang and his daughter over allegations of “aggravated tax fraud laundering,” after the French media outlet Mediapart reported that the family and Epstein were allegedly linked through an offshore company that Epstein set up in 2016 and Lang’s daughter owned half the shares of.
Lang’s lawyer told RTL radio that Lang “is very sad and deeply hurt to be leaving a position he loves,” but that he was putting “the interests of the Arab World Institute first,” the AP reported. His lawyer said that Lang denies the allegations against him.
New York School of Visual Arts department chair David A. Ross
Earlier this month, David A. Ross stepped down as department chair at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, after email correspondence between him and Epstein was revealed in the latest document drop by the Justice Department.
The two men continued communicating even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. In one email released by the Justice Department, dated in 2009, Epstein wrote to Ross, “I might want to fund an exhibition entitled statutory.. girls and boys ages 14 - 25.. where they look nothing like their true ages. Juvenile mug shots. , photo shop, make up. some people go to prison because they can’t tell true age. controversial . fun.”
Ross replied, “You are incredible. This would be a very owerful and freaky book.”
Ross, who once led renowned art institutions such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, told the Times that he regretted that he was “taken in” by Epstein’s story, adding that he was “appalled” by Epstein’s crimes and was “deeply concerned” for the victims.
Ross has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Calls for further resignations
Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called on Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to step down from his position, after the Justice Department’s latest document drop revealed that Lutnick’s ties to Epstein were more extensive than he had previously disclosed.
The newly released files appear to show that Lutnick and Epstein, who at one point were neighbors on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, continued to interact for years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. Among the documents released by the Justice Department are emails in which Lutnick seemed to discuss visiting Epstein’s private island in 2012. Lutnick has since confirmed that he and his family went to Epstein’s private island that year, though he previously said that he had ended his relationship with the disgraced financier years earlier. He said during a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Feb. 10 that he and his family were on vacation at the time of the visit, and were only on the island for about an hour.
Lutnick has denied any wrongdoing.
“I didn’t look through the documents with any fear whatsoever, because I know and my wife knows that I have done absolutely nothing wrong in any possible regard,” he said at the hearing. “I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with that person. Okay?”
Several lawmakers accused Lutnick of misrepresenting the extent of his ties to Epstein. Some have said he should resign, including Massie, who co-authored the law that required the Justice Department to release all the files related to Epstein. “Really, he should make life easier on the President, frankly, and just resign,” Massie told CNN’s Inside Politics.
Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia of California have also called on Lutnick to step down.
Public backlash has also surged against Casey Wasserman, the founder of the entertainment and sports agency the Wasserman Media Group, after flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman and Maxwell in 2003 became public in the newly released files.
Some of Wasserman’s big-name clients, including popstar Chappell Roan and soccer legend Abby Wambach, left his agency after the document drop. Last week, Wasserman said that he was planning to sell the agency.
Wasserman has also faced calls to step down as the head of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing team from the city’s mayor, Karen Bass. Bass told CNN on Monday that she “cannot fire him” herself, but that “my opinion is that he should step down” as the head of the organizing team.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has brushed off questions about Wasserman in the wake of the Department of Justice’s latest release.
“I understand there are many conversations happening at this moment but I will not make any further comment,” IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said on Tuesday at a press conference. “This is obviously a matter for the board of LA28 still at this stage.”
The LA Olympics board previously expressed support for Wasserman continuing in his role after it conducted a review of his contact with Epstein and Maxwell, which Wasserman cooperated with.
Wasserman has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and Maxwell.
“I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell,” he said in a previous statement, the AP reported. He added that his communication with Maxwell was “long before her horrific crimes came to light.”

Historic Sites Are Where Americans Learn Who We Are

A few years after a “Western Civilization” course led me to change my plans from law school to a Ph.D., my professor—a University of Chicago legend named Karl Weintraub whose teaching inspired generations of us to stand in line overnight hoping for a place in his class—wrote to me about what he wanted students to learn. I reread his 1986 letter recently and found some resonance with current debates about our national past. Mr. Weintraub’s words about teaching history clarified why all Americans have a stake in what happens at our National Historic Sites.
In the classroom, Mr. Weintraub wrote that he poured himself into telling human stories of yearning and fear and achievement: “All the different teaching, undergraduate and graduate, seems to confront me all too often with moments when I feel like screaming suddenly: ‘Oh my god, my dear student, why cannot you see that this matter is a real, real matter, often a matter of the very being, for the person, for the historical men and women, you are looking at—or supposed to be looking at!’”
Mr. Weintraub was reminding me, an aspiring professor, that it’s not enough to analyze the dead. Even as you respect the chasm between their time and now, you need to see through their eyes.
Historic sites can offer this experience to every American, but these places are now at risk. In National Parks across the country, government officials are removing, often without explanation, exhibits that enable us to see through the eyes of people who lived in a world different from our own. In Philadelphia, local officials and organizations are fighting back. All Americans have a stake in the outcome.
Read more: We’ve Never Agreed About George Washington and Slavery
National Historic Sites are America’s open classrooms—places where people from every zip code stand on ground that holds stories of our dead. At them, we learn how to imagine ourselves into radically different, multi-faceted lives: a Massachusetts farmer fighting at the Battle of Lexington. A California fisherman incarcerated at the Manzanar War Relocation Center. The nonagenarian daughter of a doctor born into slavery, celebrating the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
Few college classrooms can compare. Visit the National Mall in Washington and you will walk where, for over a century, Americans holding starkly opposed and sometimes abhorrent views have exercised our First Amendment rights. At the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side, you can stand in apartments from which generations of immigrants helped to build New York’s economy, neighborhoods, and culture.
Go to Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia and you will cross the living quarters of persons enslaved in George Washington’s household just before you see the Liberty Bell, so named by abolitionists in the 1830s, eighty years after it had been inscribed with words from Leviticus: “Proclaim Liberty thro’ all the Land to all the Inhabitants thereof.”
Dwight Pitcaithley, a former Chief Historian at the National Park Service, described this experience: “The contradiction in the founding of the country between freedom and slavery becomes palpable when one actually crosses through a slave quarters site when entering a shrine to a major symbol of the abolition movement.... How better to establish the proper historical context for understanding the Liberty Bell than by talking about the institution of slavery?”
Equipped with background information, a visitor could in a single day imagine the world through the eyes of an abolitionist newspaper editor, a Revolutionary War general who became our first president, and an enslaved Virginian who seized her freedom from that president.
Everyone deserves the kind of experience Pitcaithley described. No one can have it when government officials selectively erase stories that historic places hold.
No one is served when ongoing research is thwarted or challenging exhibits are removed. Visitors to the sites at Independence Park were cheated when they were cut off from facts that enable us to imagine ourselves in the lives of those who lived and worked there. Removing these exhibits, as U.S. District Judge Cynthia M. Rufe noted in her recent opinion ordering the National Park Service to restore them, is tantamount to “dismantling objective historical truths.” The exhibit on the history of slavery at the President’s House in Philadelphia was restored this week.
Seeing the world through the eyes of the dead takes humility and courage. Humility, because no matter how much we know, there’s always more to learn. And courage, because we’ll discover unsettling realities, both about the past and about ourselves.
I learned so much in Mr. Weintraub’s class on Western civilization. He spoke with memorable urgency when he wanted us to grasp hard realities. Athenians enjoyed democracy at home while sanctioning brutal conquest abroad. Fighting for a perfectly egalitarian France could lead one to commit acts of undeniable cruelty. Holding fast to pacificism could contribute to a massacre. An inspiring ideal of universal human freedom could emerge on the backs of enslaved human beings. Two at-odds facts can both be true, and all of us are susceptible to arrogance and self-serving rationalization.
From Mr. Weintraub’s perspective, our best defense, our best hope, was to learn where we had come from.
Human beings, Toni Morrison wrote in her essay collection The Source of Self-Regard, “are the moral inhabitants of the globe. To deny this, regardless of our feeble attempts to live up to it, is to lie in prison.” If I read Morrison right, our status as moral comes from a capability—one we rarely exercise—“to project, to become the other, to imagine her or him.”
National Historic Sites nurture this capability at a scale few institutions can match. They give us the opportunity, over and over, to imagine ourselves in the lives of others.
It’s on us, the American people, to make sure that these meaningful places are free to do that, both now and into the future.

Russians intensify attacks in Rodynske and Hryshyne areas in Donetsk region
According to Ukrinform, the Operation Task Force East reported this on Facebook.
Units of the Ukrainian Defense Forces in the area controlled by the Operation Task Force East are holding back the Russian offensive. Over the past 24 hours, they have repelled 75 assaults.
"Ukrainian units continue active operations in the Pokrovsk-Myrnohrad agglomeration. The enemy has intensified its efforts to encircle Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, with the Russians increasing pressure, particularly in the areas of the settlements of Rodynske and Hryshyne. The situation remains difficult. With the expansion of the kill zone and the constant activity of enemy drones, logistics are significantly complicated, but are being maintained," the report says.
In total, over the past 24 hours, Ukrainian defenders stopped 39 assault and offensive actions by Russian troops in the areas of Rodynske, Myrnohrad, Pokrovsk, Kotlyne, Udachne, Molodetske, Muravka, Novomykolaivka, and toward Novooleksandrivka, Kucheriv Yar, Serhiivka, and Novopavlivka.
According to preliminary estimates, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed 96 unmanned aerial vehicles, four motor vehicles, three pieces of special equipment, five quad bikes, two artillery systems, and two personnel shelters. Also, they hit one armored combat vehicle, 11 vehicles, two artillery systems, and 70 enemy personnel shelters.
The Russian army has intensified its efforts to encircle Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, increasing pressure in the areas of Kotlyne and Rodynske.
Ukrainian Defense Forces units are countering these enemy efforts. In particular, enhanced aerial reconnaissance and additional mining of likely advance routes by Russian troops are underway.
Defense Forces are conducting search-and-strike operations to prevent the invaders' further advance, destroying vehicles that enemy assault groups are attempting to use.
Search-and-strike operations by Ukrainian units are also continuing in Myrnohrad and its surroundings.
The Russians continue to use small infantry groups, which is critically depleting their human resources.
Overall, within the Operation Task Force East's area of responsibility, the occupiers' losses remain the highest, up to 388 invaders per day.
In addition, 1,513 UAVs of various types and 158 other weapons and equipment were destroyed.
The Defense Forces focus not only on eliminating enemy infantry, but also on drone operators. Over the past day, 33 Russian drone control points were hit.
As reported by Ukrinform, 175 combat clashes between the Ukrainian Defense Forces and Russian invaders were recorded on the front line over the past day.

Snapchat clue leads to dramatic river rescue after friends’ night out
Police footage shows a dramatic river rescue after a young man became separated from his group of friends on a night out in Durham earlier in February.
After he went missing, his group of friends used Snapchat to track his location to Frankland Lane by the River Wear, where he was clinging to a fallen tree branch.
A second young man also became trapped just inches above the water while attempting to pull his friend to safety.
Police arrived on the scene minutes later, rescuing the pair in the pouring rain and on a slippery riverbank.
One of the men was taken to hospital with hypothermia.
"Particularly where alcohol is involved, please remember that a situation like this can become lethal in a heartbeat," Durham Constabulary warned.

Police search at Andrew’s former home in Windsor enters third day

Buckingham Palace will not oppose plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the royal line of succession, the Guardian understands, as police confirmed a search of his former Windsor home would continue over the weekend.
Royal sources indicated on Saturday that King Charles would not stand in the way of parliament if it wanted to ensure the former prince could never ascend to the throne.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested this week on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, remains eighth in line to succeed the king, despite being stripped of all of his royal titles and relieved of any official duties.
The arrest came after the US Department of Justice released files suggesting Mountbatten-Windsor passed confidential government information to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and other contacts while acting as a UK trade envoy.
Mountbatten-Windsor ceased to be a working royal in 2019 after a catastrophic Newsnight interview in which he refused to apologise for his continued friendship with Epstein.
In 2022, he paid a reported £12m settlement to the late Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked to Mountbatten-Windsor by the disgraced financier. Mountbatten-Windsor has denied Giuffre’s allegations and the payment was made without any admission of liability.
He was stripped of his remaining royal titles late last year as more information about his links to Epstein emerged, but retains his place in the line of succession, behind Prince William and his three children and Prince Harry and his two children.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who was arrested and questioned on his 66th birthday on Thursday, is still officially a counsellor of state – a member of the group of royals who could stand in for the king if he is ill or abroad. However, it is understood that this is highly unlikely to happen in practice, as only working royals are asked to deputise.
Removing him from the line of succession would require fresh legislation, which would need the support of MPs and peers, as well as royal assent from the king. It would also have to be backed by the 14 Commonwealth countries where the king is head of state.
Ministers have suggested that the government has already made overtures to the palace about plans for a law change once the police investigation has concluded. Luke Pollard, a defence minister, told BBC Radio 4 that the government had “absolutely” been working with the palace on its plans to stop Mountbatten-Windsor from “potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne”.
He said this was something he hoped would “enjoy cross-party support” but added that “it’s right that this is something that only happens when the police investigation concludes”.
James Murray, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told Sky News: “The government is considering any further steps that might be required, and we’re not ruling anything out. But at this stage, it would be inappropriate for us to go any further because there is a live police investigation under way.”
Ed Davey said the Liberal Democrats would support any legislation to remove Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of succession, saying any ascension to the throne would be “intolerable”.
Mountbatten-Windsor is the first royal to be arrested in more than 350 years, since Charles I was taken prisoner after his defeat by parliamentary forces in 1647 in the English civil war. He was found guilty of treason and executed two years later.
The former Duke of York was questioned by detectives from Thames Valley police on Thursday and spent 11 hours in police custody. He was released under investigation and there are understood to be no restrictions on his movements while officers continue their inquiries.
The force said on Saturday that searches at his former home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, were likely to continue over the weekend. Detectives have already searched Mountbatten-Windsor’s new home, on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Items seized from the properties are now being examined, it is understood.
Thames Valley police said it was yet to take formal early investigative advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, meaning a decision on whether to charge Mountbatten-Windsor could be some time away.
Mountbatten-Windsor has declined to comment on any of the recent developments, but has previously denied wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Epstein, who took his own life in a New York prison cell after being charged with child sex trafficking offences in 2019.
The former prince continued his friendship with Esptein after his conviction for child sex offences in 2008, visiting him in New York, inviting him to Buckingham Palace and sending him intimate family photographs.
Ghislaine Maxwell, another close friend of Mountbatten-Windsor and an accomplice of Epstein, is serving a 20-year prison sentence in the US for her role in his crimes.

Pressure on William and Kate to restore royal family’s reputation
- Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal has intensified scrutiny of the royal family.
- PR expert Mark Borkowski says that the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, face the significant challenge of rebuilding the institution's integrity and public trust.
- The future monarchs are expected to articulate a clear vision for the monarchy's future to address what some consider its worst crisis in 90 years.
- King Charles III had previously stripped Andrew of his titles and, following the arrest, issued a statement saying that “the law must take its course”.
- There are increasing calls for parliamentary scrutiny into the issues surrounding Andrew's past role as a trade envoy and his association with Epstein.

Golden boy: Swiss skier Franjo von Allmen given hero’s welcome
Skier Franjo von Allmen was welcomed back to his home in the Bernese Oberland on Friday after his triple success at the Olympic Games. The whole of Boltigen was on its feet to celebrate the gold medallist in the downhill, super-G and team combined.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
In the marquee, sports reporter Rainer Maria Salzgeber welcomed the audience and guided them through the ceremony. Hundreds watched the event on the big screen in front of the marquee.
On stage with their role model were children and young people from the youth section of the local ski club. After his return from the Olympic Games in Italy, von Allmen took the opportunity to take part in a club race and compete with the Simmental three-cheese skiers.
+ Olympics: Swiss von Allmen continues golden streak with Super‑G win
In his down-to-earth and mischievous manner, the 24-year-old answered the sports reporter’s questions. A school choir performed a specially written song for the ski racer, who was visibly moved. When asked whether he had been a good pupil, he became somewhat embarrassed. He was okay, “but I probably didn’t do too much,” he admitted.
In the Boltigen region, numerous houses and barns were decorated with congratulatory banners. “Bravo Franjo” could be read, for example, and Olympic rings hastily painted on sheets could be seen.
Dream career
The 24-year-old has had a dream career in ski racing. The Simmental boy gained his first skiing experience on the Jaun Pass, a small ski area in the foothills of the Alps on the border between cantons Bern and Fribourg.
It was only gradually that a career as a ski racer began to take shape. The sudden death of his father put the 17-year-old to the test. His skiing career was hanging by a thread, not least for financial reasons. However, crowdfunding kept the young ski racer and trained carpenter on course.
He repaid the support with successes. After FIS and European Cup races, von Allmen was given his first opportunity to compete in the World Cup in Aspen, US, in March 2023. He finished in 46th place.
Three years later, the man from Boltig is a double world champion and three-time Olympic champion and is one of the most successful ski racers in the world.
It is said that he owes his first name Franjo, which is rather exotic by Simmental standards, to a neighbour of the von Allmen family. The sonorous name appealed to father von Allmen. Because the first name is very popular in Croatia, the Simmental has a large fan base there. Franjo is the Slavic diminutive of Franz.
In Switzerland, von Allmen has also long had a fan club. His fans call themselves “Franatics”. When it was founded in 2022, the club had 13 members; today it has around 1,600.

Angry Trump Imposes 10% global Tariff After Stinging Court Rebuke

President Donald Trump imposed an additional 10 percent tariff on imports into the United States on Friday after the Supreme Court struck down many of his sweeping and often arbitrary duties, delivering a stinging rebuke to his signature economic policy.
Trump signed the tariff order in the Oval Office – saying on social media it was “effective almost immediately” -- after spending the past year imposing various rates to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
The new duty is slated to take effect on February 24 for 150 days, with exemptions remaining for sectors under separate probes, including pharma, and for goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement, according to a White House factsheet.
US trading partners that reached tariff deals with Trump’s administration will now also face a 10 percent duty, despite higher levels they may have agreed on previously, the White House said.
But a White House official told AFP that the Trump administration would seek ways to “implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates” down the line.
Earlier Friday, the conservative-majority high court ruled six to three that a 1977 law Trump has relied on to slap sudden rates on individual countries, upending global trade, “does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.”
Trump, who had nominated two of the justices who repudiated him, responded furiously, alleging without evidence that foreign interests influenced the court.
IOC Chief ‘Wasn’t Aware’ of FIFA Head’s Participation in Trump’s Board of Peace
“I’m ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” Trump told reporters.
“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past,” Trump said, insisting that the ruling left him “more powerful.”
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, addressing the Economic Club of Dallas, said the alternative method “will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026.”
Major setback
The ruling did not affect the sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminum, and other goods. Government probes still underway could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
Still, it marked Trump’s biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
The justices ruled Friday that “had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs” through the 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, “it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes.”
“IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in his opinion.
Wall Street saw share prices rise modestly after the expected decision.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this “provides much-needed certainty” for companies.
Doubts about refunds
In court arguments, the Trump administration said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the one Trump nominee to side with him, noted the refund process could be a “mess.”
The University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model projected that the court’s decision on tariffs could yield up to $175 billion in refunds.
California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is widely expected to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, said Americans deserved refunds from the “illegal cash grab.”
“Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately – with interest. Cough up!”
But Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, cautioned that there remained “no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid.”
The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates consumers face an average effective tariff rate of 9.1 percent with Friday’s decision, down from 16.9 percent.
The rate “remains the highest since 1946,” excluding 2025, it said.
Close US trading partners, including the EU and UK, said they were studying the decision.
Canada, which has faced repeated tariff threats as Trump questioned the sovereignty of the northern neighbor, said the Supreme Court showed the levies were “unjustified,” but the country braced for more turbulence.
“Canada should prepare for new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects,” said Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

India and Brazil sign trade and minerals partnership pact

India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after talks in New Delhi with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
"The agreement on critical minerals and rare earths in a major step towards building resilient supply chains," Modi said.
Brazil has the world's second-largest reserves of critical minerals, which are used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smartphones to jet engines and guided missiles.
India, seeking to cut its dependence on top exporter China, has been expanding domestic production and recycling while scouting for new suppliers.
"Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energies and critical minerals is at the core of the pioneering agreement that we have signed today," Lula said.
The details of the deal were not immediately available.
Nine other agreements and memoranda of understanding were finalised on Saturday, the foreign ministry's spokesman said, touching on digital cooperation, health, entrepreneurship and other fields.
"Brazil is India's largest trade partner in Latin America. We are committed to taking our bilateral trade beyond $20 billion in the coming five years," Modi said.
"Our trade is not just a figure, but a reflection of trust."
Lula, who arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for a summit on artificial intelligence, is accompanied by a delegation of more than a dozen ministers as well as business leaders.
On Saturday, he was given a ceremonial welcome and paid his tributes to India's independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, before going into the meeting with Modi.
With China holding a near-monopoly on rare earths production, some countries are seeking alternative sources.
Rishabh Jain, an expert with the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank, said India's growing cooperation with Brazil on critical minerals complements recent supply chain engagements with the United States, France and the European Union.
While these partnerships grant India access to advanced technologies, finance and high-end processing capabilities, "Global South alliances are critical for securing diversified, on-ground resource access and shaping emerging rules of global trade", Jain told AFP.
'New momentum'
India, the world's most populous nation, is the 10th largest market for Brazilian exports, with bilateral trade topping $15 billion in 2025.
Key Brazilian exports to India include sugar, crude oil, vegetable oils, cotton and iron ore.
Demand for iron ore has been driven by rapid infrastructure expansion and industrial growth in India, which is on track to become the world's fourth largest economy.
India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he was confident that Lula's talks with Modi "will impart a new momentum to our ties".
Modi said that "our cooperation in the defence sector is also continuously growing," hailing a "win-win partnership".
"When India and Brazil work together, the voice of Global South becomes stronger and more confident."
Brazilian firms are also expanding in the country, with Embraer and Adani Group announcing plans last month to build aircraft in India.
Lula addressed the AI Impact summit in Delhi on Thursday, calling for a multilateral and inclusive global governance framework for artificial intelligence.
He will travel on to South Korea for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum.

Macron orders review of violent activist groups after fatal beating of far-right activist
President Emmanuel Macron will launch a government review of violent activist groups after a far-right student died from a beating in Lyon
- Bookmark
French President Emmanuel Macron will hold meetings next week to review violent activist groups, after a far-right student died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
Speaking at the Paris agriculture fair, Macron called on “everyone to remain calm” ahead of Saturday's tributes organized by far-right groups to Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week. The demonstrations will take place under heavy police scrutiny.
“This is a moment of remembrance and respect for this young compatriot who was killed, for his family and loved ones. That must come first. And then it is a moment of firmness and responsibility,” Macron said.
Seven people have been handed preliminary charges. The Lyon public prosecutor’s office requested that each of them be charged with intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy. Six of the accused were charged on all three counts. The seventh was charged with complicity in intentional homicide, aggravated violence and criminal conspiracy.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate,” he said. “There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising.”
The main tribute to Deranque was scheduled later Saturday in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Lyon’s far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque’s parents have also called for calm and won’t take part in the tribute, which has not been banned by French authorities.
Deranque’s death triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming France Unbowed and its leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a France Unbowed lawmaker, Raphaël Arnault, who set up the anti-fascist group The Young Guard.
France Unbowed’s opponents accuse it of fomenting violence and tensions with its combative far-left politics. Mélenchon has condemned the violence and insisted that his party bore no blame for the tragedy.
Mélenchon stood for the presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022, and failed to advance to the decisive runoff round. He is preparing for another expected run next year, when Macron’s second and last term ends.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonize France Unbowed. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party while criticism also came from prominent figures on the left.

A man has been charged with carrying out a hate crime after crashing his truck into the gates of a synagogue in Brisbane, Australia, on Friday night, according to an ABC News report.
The incident took place on Margaret Street in the central business district of Brisbane, where security cameras recorded the 32-year-old suspect fleeing the scene shortly after ramming his truck into the gates.
CCTV footage captured the moment the truck arrived at the synagogue, reversed into the gates, dented one gate, and knocked the other off its hinges. A person was seen moving out of the way as the gate fell.
No injuries were reported during the incident. Police were called shortly afterward and began investigating the scene.
Police investigate hate crime after truck crashes into synagogue
Acting Superintendent Michael Hogan stated that the police responded quickly, tracked the vehicle, located the suspect, and made a timely arrest, according to the ABC report.
Hogan also clarified that the incident is not being treated as a potential terrorist act, as police have concluded the suspect did intend to damage the gates, but there is no indication he intended to enter the synagogue.
“This is a criminal investigation. Police are considering the man’s mental health and intoxication as contributing factors,” Hogan said.
"An attack on all of us": Leaders react to hate crime
Libby Burke, the vice president of the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies, expressed that the community feels “deeply distressed” by the targeting of their synagogue. “This attack is not only an attack on my community; it is an attack on all of us,” she stated.
She also expressed the community’s “extraordinary gratitude” to the Queensland Police Service for their “prompt action” and support.
Opposition leader Steven Miles said he was “deeply troubled” to hear of the incident.
“Queensland’s Jewish community should always feel safe and respected, especially in a place of worship,” he said. “There is no place for hate or intimidation in Queensland.”
Dr. Dvir Abramovich, chair of the Anti-Defamation Commission, commented on the incident, stating, “We are told this is not being treated as terrorism. But when a synagogue is deliberately attacked, the label matters less than the impact. The fear is real. The shock is real. The message is unmistakable.
“Since October 7, antisemitism in this country has not whispered, it has roared. It has leapt from slogans to smashed windows, from online bile to physical assaults on Jewish spaces and individuals as we saw at Bondi. And now, a car used like a battering ram against a synagogue in the heart of Brisbane.”

Russia claims to capture another settlement in Ukraine
Russia, Ukraine claim overnight drone attacks resulted in injuries
MOSCOW
The Russian Defense Ministry claimed on Saturday that its forces captured another settlement in eastern Ukraine.
The ministry said in a statement that the village of Karpovka went under the control of the Russian forces as a result of the Zapad (West) group of forces.
According to the ministry, Ukraine responded with air raids involving five Flamingo missiles, and 172 drones were shot down across Russia overnight.
In a separate statement, Governor of the Russian Udmurtia region Sergey Bagin said 11 people were injured in the overnight drone attack.
“Three people were hospitalized, two with moderate injuries, one in difficult condition. Eight people were examined by doctors. They were released under outpatient supervision,” he said on Telegram.
The media outlet Astra claimed that the Votkinsk plant in Udmurtia, as well as a gas and oil refinery in another region, Samara, were hit.
Separately, Ukraine's Odesa military administration said one person was injured and an energy object was damaged as a result of Russia’s overnight air attack.
In the Sumy region, two people were injured as a result of Russian strikes, the government of the region said.
Independent verification of claims is challenging due to the ongoing Moscow-Kyiv armed conflict.

The Tel Aviv Prosecutor’s Office indicted a 19-year-old for committing indecent acts and attempting to commit indecent acts on minors online, the State Attorney’s Office announced on Wednesday.
The 19-year-old Mazkeret Batya resident, identified as Rotem Aknin, created fake Snapchat and TikTok profiles on which he claimed to be a 14-year-old named Liron, according to the indictment.
An investigation conducted by Unit 105 of the Israel Police, the Israel Police’s Cyber Unit, and the State Attorney’s Office revealed that Aknin used fake social media profiles to approach four minors and asked them to commit indecent acts, take photos, and send them to him.
Aknin coerced, manipulated underage victims
When one victim refused his request, he attempted to coerce her into complying, telling her to “have fun,” “I owe you,” "I don't like people not listening to me," and asking her to “just lift up [her] shirt."
Aknin was charged with multiple offences, including inflicting an indecent act on a minor under the age of 16 via fraud, attempting to inflict an indecent act on a minor under the age of 16 via fraud, providing false information, and using explicit images of a minor to “make obscene advertising,” the indictment detailed.
According to Israel Police’s Cyber Unit, Aknin “systematically committed the offenses against four minors, and attempted to approach many other minors in the same fraudulent manner.”
Along with the filing of the indictment, the department submitted a request for Aknin to remain in detention until the end of his legal proceedings.

Tehran challenges US figures on Iran protest toll

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday dismissed US claims that 32,000 civilians were killed during protests in Iran, saying Tehran has already released official figures and calling for evidence to substantiate higher estimates.
"You know, the people of Iran are a lot different from the leaders of Iran, and it's a very, very, very sad situation," US President Donald Trump said Friday, adding that 32,000 people were killed there over a "relatively short period of time."
In remarks through X, Araghchi said Tehran had already fulfilled its “pledge of full transparency” by publishing an official list documenting 3,117 victims of what he described as “recent terrorist operations,” including around 200 security personnel.
He added that “if anyone disputes the accuracy of our data, please share any evidence.”
Earlier Friday, Trump said he was "considering" a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal, without providing further details.
The latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, according to official figures.
Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of backing what they described as “rioting” and “terrorism.”
Iran and the US resumed nuclear negotiations earlier this month in the Omani capital Muscat, followed by another round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday under Oman's mediation.
The renewed diplomacy comes amid heightened regional tensions, fueled by a significant US military buildup in the Persian Gulf, as well as Iranian military drills.
Trump, speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, DC, on Thursday, warned that the US would opt for military action against Iran “within 10 to 15 days” if negotiations fail.

Censorship of Palestine overshadows Berlin Film Festival finale
Politics and accusations of censorship linked to Palestine dominated the 76th Berlin Film Festival, diverting attention from the 22 films competing for top honours.
Gaza has been a point of heated debate since the first day of the festival, when jury president Wim Wenders answered a question about the German government's support for Israel by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."
That sparked a backlash from figures including Arundhati Roy, Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton.
Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, pulled out of the event, branding Wender's words "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping".
On Tuesday, a letter signed by dozens of film industry figures, including Javier Bardem, Tilda Swinton and Adam McKay, condemned the Berlin festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians".
The letter, drafted by the Film Workers for Palestine collective, accused the Berlinale of being involved in "censoring artists who oppose Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the German state's key role in enabling it".
Festival director Tricia Tuttle has defended Wenders and denied accusations that the festival has engaged in censorship.
Palestine on screen
Meanwhile, this year's Berlin Film Festival has also seen some of the works being shown also grappling with the devastating conflict and its global impact.
On screen, one of the films dealing with the global ramifications of the conflict -- past and present -- is the documentary "Who Killed Alex Odeh?"
Directed by Jason Osder and William Lafi Youmans, the film looks at the aftermath of the killing of the Palestinian-American activist of the title.
Odeh was the West Coast regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and was killed in a bomb attack at the ADC's offices in Santa Ana, California in 1985.
Among the film's wealth of archive footage is testimony to a congressional committee from Oliver Revell, then FBI assistant director, who said "members of a Jewish extremist element" were likely responsible.
Odeh's widow and daughter also speak movingly about the killing's impact on their lives.
No one has ever been convicted for the bombing.
The film traces how suspicion fell in particular on several members of the Jewish Defense League, a group founded by extremist rabbi Meir Kahane before his own assassination in 1990.
Youmans told AFP news agency that despite dealing with an event from more than 40 years ago, the film took on "a burning kind of urgency" given the influence that Kahane's ideology has gained in Israel in recent years.
The current far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir previously campaigned for Kahane's now-banned political party, Kach, and became notorious for his anti-Arab rhetoric.
Did Youmans himself have any qualms about coming to Berlin, given the controversy around the festival?
"I feel that Alex's story is a necessary one to be told," Youmans said, adding it would be "self-defeatist" not to show it at the festival.
As for the response from German audiences, he said he has found that there is "a public opinion here... that is more willing to question unconditional support for Israel, is more willing to show solidarity with the Palestinians".
'Rare' collaboration
In "Where To?" by Israeli director Assaf Machnes, the conflict remains off screen but makes its presence felt.
It follows 55-year-old Palestinian cab driver Hassan, played with warmth and subtlety by Ehab Salami, as he ferries passengers through the nocturnal streets of Berlin.
He strikes up an unlikely bond with Israeli passenger Amir, a lost soul in his early 20s played by Ido Tako, which leads Hassan to reflect on roads not taken in his own life.
Salami is himself a Palestinian who lives in Israel and Machnes says that the film represents a collaboration which is "very, very rare" in Israeli cinema.
"Actors that were auditioning for (Hassan's) role were very thirsty for a role like that," Machnes told AFP.
He said that the film was partially inspired by his own chance meeting with a Palestinian cab driver in Berlin.
"It was different than the usual encounters I have with my Palestinian artist friends; there was this unbinding connection, because we don't know if we're going to see each other" again, he said.
While Machnes says he does not think of his own work as inherently political, he wryly observes that "in Israel, if you film a cat drinking milk, it's political".
While recognising that "we all live in a political context", Machnes told AFP he tries in his work to avoid any "intention to preach".
If the film does have a message, it is about the possibility of empathy in even the most difficult situations.
Salami said he hoped the government in Israel would heed the film's example to "make the way for peace... and something different".

When Israel searched for a kidnapped, raped and murdered 4-year-old girl in 1953

Rachel Levin, 4 and a half years old, left her home in the Neve Yehoshua neighborhood of Ramat Gan on February 14, 1953, wearing a red dress. Her mother had sent her to a neighbor’s house to call her father. She never returned.
Shortly after midnight that Saturday night, police trackers arrived at the Levin family home and received a brief account: the child had left hours earlier and disappeared without a trace. That was the starting point of “Operation Satan,” one of the largest search operations in the early years of the State of Israel.
Police squads spread out across the open fields surrounding the neighborhood. The immediate fear was that wolves and jackals roaming the area might attack a lost child. Officers fired shots into the air and sounded their horns in an effort to drive animals away during the search.
By the next morning, when Rachel had not been found, police cadets from the training school in Shfaram and soldiers from the nearby Tel Hashomer base were called in. Despite stormy weather, more than 1,000 professionals and volunteers participated in Operation Satan, including aircraft assisting in aerial searches.
About 40 hours after the search began, a breakthrough came. A pilot reported spotting a piece of red fabric caught on a prickly pear cactus near the Hiriya garbage dump. Guided by the pilot, search teams reached the site and found Rachel’s body concealed beneath cactus leaves, bearing severe signs of violence.
A police pathologist determined that the child had been raped and murdered by repeated blows to the head with a blunt object. A wrench found near the body was identified as the murder weapon. Bicycle tire tracks were also discovered at the scene.
At that moment, Operation Satan shifted from a search effort to a manhunt for a brutal killer. Investigators believed the perpetrator was likely a local resident, given the proximity between the disappearance site and the dump and the apparent familiarity with the terrain. Transit camps in the area were placed under lockdown, and residents seeking to enter or leave were subjected to thorough inspections and questioning. Because of the extreme violence, police suspected the killer was mentally unstable.
Media coverage triggered widespread public hysteria. The young state had never experienced such a violent and tragic crime, and reports of suspicious individuals flooded in from across the country.
That same evening, police received a tip about a strange man wandering near a cemetery in Sheikh Munis, today’s Ramat Aviv in Tel Aviv. Officers arrested Ben Zion Samuha, a 36-year-old immigrant from Iraq who lived nearby. He was detained after police noticed bloodstains on his clothing and light-colored hair resembling Rachel’s blond hair. Samuha was brought before a judge and remanded for two weeks, but was soon released when it became clear the blood was his own and the hair belonged to a dog.
The investigation stalled and suspects were released. Two months later, staff at a psychiatric hospital in Jerusalem contacted police to report that one of their patients, Victor Mizrahi, had confessed to murdering a girl in a red dress.
During interrogation, Mizrahi said that after his son fell seriously ill, he had been told that slaughtering a red rooster would improve the child’s condition. When his son did not recover, he concluded that sacrificing another child in place of his own was the solution. When he saw Rachel in her red dress, “just like the rooster,” he said he believed God had sent her. He offered her a ride on his bicycle, took her to Hiriya, raped her and then murdered her.
Despite claims of insanity and despite testimony from his wife that he had been home throughout the evening, Rachel disappeared. Mizrahi was convicted of rape and murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the Supreme Court accepted his insanity defense and transferred him from prison to compulsory psychiatric hospitalization. He was released in 1964.
Though the Rachel Levin case faded from headlines, the names Samuha and Mizrahi became part of Israeli cultural memory in the 1950s and 1960s. A crude folk song referencing Samuha, which circulated widely, particularly among paratroopers, was recorded for the radio and is preserved in the National Library of Israel. It is also cited in Yehoshua Kenaz’s novel “Infiltration.”
The podcast “Excavating Journalism” from Be.po revisits the tragedy that once shook the entire country and remains one of the most horrifying crimes in Israel’s early history.

'The US Supreme Court decision on tariffs does not end Donald Trump's trade wars'

Economist Sébastien Jean, the Jean-Baptiste Say Chair of Industrial Economics at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (CNAM) in Paris, believes that the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Donald Trump's tariffs on Friday, January 20, will not bring an end to his protectionist policies, but it will limit his room for maneuver.
Does the Supreme Court's decision call Donald Trump's trade policy into question?
The justices narrowly focused their decision, first by declining to rule on whether tariffs should be reimbursed. That issue was sent back to the US Court of International Trade, based in New York, and will be at stake in the coming months. The justices ruled only on whether Donald Trump was authorized to invoke a law on emergency economic powers in order to impose tariffs without Congressional approval.
Their conclusion, endorsed by half of the six conservative justices, is clear: The law does not authorize him to do so, since tariffs fall under the exclusive fiscal authority of Congress. Congress can only delegate its power to the president in explicit and limited terms. In other words, the president abused his power. This is a political rebuke for Trump. And, in a way, also for Congress, since – although not stated explicitly – it means Congress allowed itself to be stripped of its prerogatives without reacting.

PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of rallies planned on Feb 21 in memory of a far-right activist killed last week
He said that he would hold a meeting next week with the Prime Minister and relevant ministers on violent groups.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate. In the Republic, only Republican forces can act because they protect the Republican order. There is no place for militias,” Mr Macron said at the opening of the annual agricultural salon on Feb 21.
He said that the government was on alert to ensure that everything goes well at the marches later on Feb 21.
The marches are in memory of 23-year-old Quentin Deranque, who was beaten to death in a fight that was caught on camera and shocked the nation. Police are concerned the marches could turn violent, with clashes between opposing groups.
The largest march is expected at 3pm in Lyon (10pm Singapore time), the city where Mr Deranque was killed and where there is a concentration of far-right and anti-fascist groups.
The interior ministry estimates that between 2,000 and 3,000 people will attend. There are smaller marches planned in a number of other French towns. REUTERS

Senior leader in Church of England arrested on suspicion of sexual assault
Bishop of Lincoln has been suspended from his duties and was released on conditional bail
LONDON
The bishop of Lincoln, the Right Reverend Stephen Conway, has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault following a complaint to the Church of England's national safeguarding team.
Lincolnshire Police confirmed that a 68-year-old man had been arrested as part of an “ongoing investigation following an allegation that a man was sexually assaulted between 2018 and 2025.”
The bishop of Lincoln is a senior leader in the Church of England, responsible for overseeing churches and clergy in eastern England.
The role is also nationally significant because the bishop also sits in the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, helping to review and debate UK laws.
Earlier, a statement shared on the Diocese of Lincoln website confirmed that the bishop had been “suspended from ministry” following a complaint to the Church of England's national safeguarding team.
The statement said “support is in place for those affected,” and a referral had been made to the “appropriate statutory authorities.” No details of the complaint were given.
The statement added: “We understand that this will be a deeply unsettling time.”
The bishop of Grantham, the Right Reverend Dr. Nicholas Chamberlain, will stand in during the suspension.
Conway has been the bishop of Lincoln since 2023 and has been released on conditional bail.

Ukraine returns 2 children from Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast

Ukraine has managed to return two more children from Russian-occupied Kherson Oblast, bringing the total of freed children from the region to 31 this year, the head of the Kherson Regional Military Administration, Oleksandr Prokudin, reported on Feb. 21.
One of the children, a 17-year-old girl, was threatened by Russian soldiers who illegally broke into her home, searched her devices, and pointed weapons at her mother, according to Prokudin.
"They threatened to take the girl to a boarding school, and send the mother to the 'basement,'" Prokudin said.
"Fortunately, now the children and their families are safe and are receiving the necessary assistance in the Hope and Recovery centers," he added.
The children were returned under the Bring Kids Back UA initiative, which finds and returns Ukrainian children from occupied territories and Russia, alongside the Save Ukraine organization.
According to Ukraine’s national "Children of War" database, at least 20,000 Ukrainian children have been abducted from Russian-occupied territories and taken to Russia or Russian-controlled areas since February 2022. Some 1.6 million remain under Russian occupation, according to Bring Kids Back UA.
Ukrainian officials estimate the real figure of abducted children could be far higher. Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets puts the number at up to 150,000, while Presidential Commissioner for Children’s Rights Daria Herasymchuk has given a range of 200,000–300,000.
Despite multinational efforts from allies to rescue the children, some of whom have been forcibly sent to North Korea, only 2,003 have been returned to Ukraine. At least 684 have been killed and 2,369 wounded.
In 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russia’s Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for their role in state-sanctioned child abductions.

Does Prince Andrew’s Epstein scandal reach Queen Elizabeth and shake the monarchy?
Unknown

Scandals and dramas are an inseparable part of the British royal family’s daily reality, but even the darkest scripts could not have predicted how deep into the mire former Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor would drag the palace. Worse still, it appears the public has not yet seen the full scope of the disturbing ties he maintained with convicted sex offender and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Last November, seven years after his name was first linked to the disgraced billionaire, King Charles stripped his younger brother Andrew of the title “prince.” It marked the first time in modern history that a royal was deprived of a title without voluntarily relinquishing it, as King Edward VIII did to marry a divorcée or as Prince Harry and Meghan did when they stepped back from royal duties.
Charles may have anticipated what was coming. Last month, the U.S. Justice Department released three million new documents from Epstein’s files, including photographs showing Andrew leaning over a seemingly helpless minor and sitting with five young women on his lap.
The horror did not end there. The new documents revealed that Epstein allegedly transported minors to Andrew aboard his private jet, the Boeing 727 dubbed the “Lolita Express,” which hosted orgies, sex parties and trafficking, and landed in Britain about 90 times.
Email exchanges between the two suggest Andrew allowed Epstein to arrange meetings for him during an official trade delegation to China. In photos from 2010, the former prince appears socializing with a Chinese model at a secret dinner in Beijing during a 10-day royal tour in which he represented Britain. Businessman David Stern, Andrew’s adviser, described the woman in demeaning terms.
On Thursday, Andrew’s 66th birthday, six police vehicles arrived at Sandringham, where he resides, and arrested him on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Detectives are reportedly examining his actions as a UK trade envoy after emails in the Epstein files suggested he shared confidential information with Epstein, including details of official visits and potential investment opportunities.
About 12 hours later, Andrew was released and photographed leaving Norfolk Police Station shortly after 7 p.m. London time. At the time of writing, it was unclear whether he was released under investigation or on bail.
All this raises a troubling question: Was Andrew’s connection to Epstein in fact Epstein’s path to the queen? Royal historian Andrew Lownie argues the answer is yes. “Jeffrey Epstein exploited Andrew to get to Elizabeth. I think he believed he could do business for her,” Lownie said, adding that she was not the only royal in Epstein’s sights. “I have no doubt other members of the royal family met Epstein and it has simply not yet come to light. The family helped Andrew, fully aware of the people he was associating with. He had their backing, and it would not surprise me if the queen met some of these people, including Epstein.”
A scandal years in the making
The “Androgate” affair first erupted in 2019, when it became clear that Andrew, widely seen as the late Queen Elizabeth’s favorite son, had maintained close ties with Epstein. Testimonies later emerged alleging that Andrew sexually abused minors supplied by Epstein and his associates. He initially denied wrongdoing.
“At no stage during the limited time I spent with Jeffrey Epstein did I see any behavior of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction,” Andrew said at the time, though few believed him, perhaps except the queen.
“Elizabeth tried to protect him,” royal expert Richard Kay said. “People in the palace said he still held a special place in his mother’s heart.”
In August 2021, Virginia Giuffre filed a lawsuit in Manhattan seeking damages from Andrew, alleging he forced her to have sex when she was 17 and knew she was underage during encounters at Epstein’s estate. “Prince Andrew’s wealth, power, position and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened and vulnerable child that no one protected,” the suit stated.
In February 2022, Andrew and Giuffre reached an out-of-court settlement. Court documents said the prince would make a substantial donation to Giuffre’s charity, praised her courage and expressed regret for his association with Epstein. Reports at the time put the settlement at £7.5 million plus several million in legal fees, an estimated total of £12 million, largely borne by Queen Elizabeth.
In April, Giuffre, 41, died by suicide. Her family described her as “a fierce warrior in the fight against sexual abuse and sex trafficking.”
Yet revelations continued. Newly released documents show Epstein arranged a private dinner for Andrew with four young women at Buckingham Palace while Queen Elizabeth was at Balmoral, according to the Mail on Sunday.
Emails show Andrew hosted Epstein and the women, including models from Romania and Russia. Epstein described one Romanian model as “very cute” and told her she had been “perfect.” In an email to Andrew after the dinner, Epstein wrote: “That was great fun, and more to come.” Andrew replied: “Yes, please!” He also wrote the following day that it had been “great fun.”
The documents also include affectionate emails between Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate later convicted of sex trafficking minors. They addressed each other as “darling” and “Sweet Pea,” expressing that they missed one another.
In a 2002 email signed with an “A,” Andrew apologized for spending a weekend with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, instead of at the estate managed by Maxwell. Maxwell responded warmly, writing she would understand but would miss him. The next day she added: “Probably five gorgeous redheads will just have to play with themselves.” Andrew replied that he was sad not to join them but loved and missed her and looked forward to seeing her again.
Further emails reignited claims by informed insiders that Andrew and Maxwell had once had an affair. Former royal protection officer Paul Page said Maxwell’s frequent access to the palace in 2001 raised suspicions of a romantic link.
Ferguson under scrutiny
Andrew was not the only royal with something to hide. After he was stripped of his title and removed from his Windsor home, his former wife Sarah Ferguson spoke of feeling devastated and betrayed by revelations about her ex-husband. But newly released documents also exposed her close relationship with Epstein.
Emails show Ferguson visited Epstein with her daughters days after his release from a Florida jail, where he served 13 months of an 18-month sentence for soliciting sex from 14-year-old girls. “Where do I come? I will bring my daughters,” she wrote.
A week later she emailed him: “I have never been so excited by your kindness and the compliment you gave me in front of my daughters. Thank you, Jeffrey, for being the brother I always longed for.” In another email, Epstein wrote to his lawyer that “Sarah was the first to celebrate my release with her two daughters.”
In July 2009, Ferguson wrote: “You are a legend. I don’t have the words to describe, my love, the gratitude for your generosity and kindness. Kisses and hugs, I am here for you. Marry me.” Other emails show she invited him on a VIP tour of Buckingham Palace and repeated her proposal.
When Epstein’s name resurfaced in headlines, Ferguson sought to distance herself. In March 2011, days after she publicly expressed regret for her association with him, Epstein wrote to his publicist that she could still defend him, claiming she had been misled by Florida lawyers.
Royal historian Lownie believes Andrew and Ferguson are deeply entangled in the affair. “Worse is yet to come for Andrew,” he said. “The documents show he continues to lie about his relationship with Epstein. What is particularly damaging is how close Sarah was to Epstein, a connection that nearly slipped under the radar.”
He added that the palace was aware. “They knew Andrew and Sarah were under intelligence surveillance. These matters were reported to Buckingham Palace. The royal family had many opportunities to discipline Andrew but ultimately acted only under public and media pressure.”
The monarchy under strain
Caught in the middle are Andrew and Ferguson’s daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Both continue to carry out official duties and were invited to Christmas celebrations with the royal family. The Daily Mail reported that Eugenie has cut ties with her father, angered by his refusal to apologize to Epstein’s victims. Beatrice reportedly remains in contact but feels deep shame.
In an official statement, the palace expressed support for victims and willingness to cooperate with authorities. A Kensington Palace spokesperson said Prince William and Catherine were “deeply concerned” and focused on victims. King Charles reiterated his “deep concern” and pledged cooperation if approached by police.
U.S. Congressman Ro Khanna, co-author of the Epstein Transparency Act, has said Charles must publicly address what he knew about his brother’s ties. “Stripping Andrew’s title is not enough,” Khanna said.
Since his accession, Charles has promised a streamlined, modern monarchy. He has opened palace doors wider and sought to win over a public still wary over his treatment of Diana. But Andrew’s involvement now threatens the institution’s reputation.
A Savanta poll of 2,132 UK adults found only 45 percent support the monarchy, amid growing pressure on Charles and Prince William to clarify what they knew. Another YouGov poll showed 51 percent believe the royal family should respond more forcefully to the affair. Eighty-two percent said Andrew should cooperate with U.S. authorities, and 63 percent believe he should not be allowed to live on royal estates.
Meanwhile, former prime minister Gordon Brown has called Andrew’s relationship with Epstein “the greatest scandal of all” and urged a criminal investigation. Several ministers and lawmakers have echoed calls for scrutiny.
As historian Lownie put it: “You cannot believe a word that comes out of their mouths. They lie even about things they do not need to lie about. Neither of them will recover from what has surfaced or what may yet surface.”
For King Charles, the crisis is existential. Queen Elizabeth did not live to see the latest revelations. Her son must now confront the fallout and attempt to preserve a monarchy whose future, at least for now, appears more fragile than ever.

Your grandparents heard pretty much the same thing. The creators of a new technology have always sold it as producing a fundamental transformation of human existence. The radio was touted as bringing “perpetual peace on earth”. Television was supposed to arouse so much empathy for different cultures that it would end war. Cable television would educate the masses and lead to widespread enlightenment.

The man was arrested on February 18 in the Stockholm area, the Swedish Security Service (Sapo) said in a statement.
Sapo spokesman Johan Wikstrom told AFP that there were "links to violent right-wing extremism."
The only right-wing extremist group on the EU's list of terrorists and groups is the white supremacist group The Base.
Wikstrom would not say which group was involved, but he added that under Swedish anti-terrorism laws it was not required for a group be on the EU list in order for a person to be tried.
The man is suspected of "participating in a terrorist organisation" and the alleged crimes were believed to have occured from November until his arrest, according to court documents.
The court said prosecutors would need to press charges by March 20.
It also ordered that the man, who denies the crimes, should undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
Dagens Nyheter newspaper reported that the man had been admitted against his will to a psychiatric facility for five days in January.
According to the newspaper, doctors had concluded that he was suffering from a "serious psychiatric disorder".

Hong Kong Ocean Park’s last 2 arctic foxes die, den temporarily closed
‘Siu Go’ and ‘Trinity’ died of old age at 11, according to theme park
Hong Kong’s Ocean Park has temporarily closed its Arctic Fox Den after the enclosure’s last two remaining animals, “Siu Go” and “Trinity”, died of old age.
The theme park announced on Saturday that Siu Go and Trinity had both died at the age of 11. It did not specify when the deaths occurred.
“The park’s animal care and veterinary team closely monitored the health of each arctic fox throughout their later years and provided them with meticulous care,” a spokesman said.
“However, they ultimately succumbed to age-related and irreversible functional decline.
“Park staff and visitors who met these animal ambassadors will miss them dearly.”
The spokesman added that the Arctic Fox Den was currently closed to the public.

Inside the ECB, irritation grows over Lagarde’s handling of exit

FRANKFURT – Confused, irritated, uncertain.
Inside the European Central Bank (ECB), staff are in shock by reports that President Christine Lagarde will quit before her term is up, leaving questions about her authority.
A number of Governing Council members are perplexed by the lack of pushback to the speculation, according to people familiar with the matter.
Ms Lagarde’s response this week was in stark contrast to her firm denial to similar reports in 2025.
Many feel left in the dark about what the 70-year-old Frenchwoman in charge of the institution will do, the people said, asking not to be identified revealing the content of private conversations.
An internal memo to ECB staff seen by Bloomberg offered no more information than what was issued to the media.
There are also worries about threats to the key tenet of central bank independence, particularly if Ms Lagarde is seen to have left for political considerations, some of the people said.
An ECB spokesperson declined to comment.
The internal frustrations are hitting the ECB at a delicate time.
While policymakers have returned inflation to around their 2 per cent target and say that interest rates are currently in a “good place”, there is no shortage of risks facing the 21-nation euro zone that demand attention – and potentially a quick response.
US President Donald Trump’s anti-Europe stance, reflected in everything from tariffs to defense policy, as well as bloated deficits and a stronger currency, are among the threats hanging over the economy.
All have implications for inflation, which the ECB had to battle hard to get down from a post-Covid high above 10 per cent.
Questions about Ms Lagarde’s commitment to the ECB also jeopardise her authority within the institution after her predecessor Mario Draghi’s divisive leadership.
Mr Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury, sees limited impact on the euro given the ECB is widely expected to keep policy unchanged for some time, but notes there are still implications.
“The fact that Lagarde has not denied the story says a lot,” he said.
An early leadership change “could erode Lagarde’s authority and credibility during upcoming communications”.
The latest speculation was sparked by the Financial Times
The ECB did not directly deny the story, but instead fanned the rumor mill by saying the president has not made any decision on the end of her term, which suggests the topic is being considered.
Ms Lagarde had a subsequent chance to clarify her plans in a Wall Street Journal interview published later in the week
Her comment was that her “baseline” is that her mission will take until the end of her term.
If there is a sense the Frenchwoman is eying the exit, that may undercut her ability to speak for the institution with a strong voice.
It would give some European politicians reason to disregard her repeated criticism of their governments for moving too slowly on reforms to improve capital markets and competitiveness.
In the face of protectionist pressures from the US and the expansion of China’s industrial prowess, European leaders know they must respond, but they are divided on how that should happen.
Political demands
Under Ms Lagarde’s leadership, the ECB has been a loud contributor to the debate, and there is resentment in some capitals about the interference.
Ahead of a meeting of heads of state in February, the institution sent a checklist of demands to them.
Pulling the ECB – which cherishes its independence from politicians – into such discussions is a dangerous gamble.
It can backfire if those targeted consider the institution’s contributions as an invitation to reciprocate.
Even more so if the leader responsible seems in any way compromised.
The backdrop to an early Lagarde exit has a very political element.
It would allow European leaders – especially France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Friedrich Merz – to choose her successor before French presidential elections in the spring.
That would prevent Ms Marine Le Pen of the National Rally, which may win the election, having sway in the ECB succession,
Ms Le Pen’s protege, Mr Jordan Bardella, has signalled that the party would push the ECB to restart quantitative easing to help with France’s fiscal problems, disregarding rules that prohibit the central bank from directly financing governments.
France’s central-bank chief, Mr Francois Villeroy de Galhau, also announced recently that he would leave his post prematurely.
But in trying to protect the ECB, Ms Lagarde risks harming it.
“Benefits should be carefully weighed against the risk that an appointment strategy designed to pre‑empt the choice of France’s next president could fuel populist and anti‑establishment sentiment,” said Mr Marco Valli, head of macroeconomic analysis at UniCredit in Milan.
“EU leaders and the ECB must navigate this process with great care.”
This is not the first time that questions about Ms Lagarde’s future have emerged.
In 2025, she was rumored to be considering trading her Frankfurt office for one near Geneva running the World Economic Forum.
In the WSJ interview, Ms Lagarde said the WEF is “one of the many options” she is considering for after the ECB. BLOOMBERG

The outlook for the expansion and development of business between the two countries would be improved with the implementation of the customs agreements between the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Islamic Republic of Iran, he noted.
The chairman called on the private sector officials of the two countries to make their utmost efforts for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries.
A databank of Russian and Iranian entrepreneurs, who are ready to cooperate in this regard, should be created, he said, adding that suitable ways should be paved to provide more information to local businesses on the Iranian side.
In addition, the Russian side should strengthen the information atmosphere and introduce Iranian companies more in Russia.
He emphasized that the two countries enjoy high potentials and capabilities to increase the level of bilateral trade more than ever.
Today, Iran is home to several innovative and technological units that can export their products to Russia easily, Lozhechko added.

30 people in Iran face death penalty after protests, Amnesty says
A death sentence has been passed in eight cases, while two minors are among the 22 other cases before the courts
A death sentence had already been passed in eight cases, the organisation reported on Friday.
Among the 22 other cases before the courts, two men were still minors, Amnesty said. The Iranian judiciary has not officially confirmed any of the death sentences.
However, a week ago, the Misan news agency, which is linked to the authorities, reported on a trial in which three men could face the death penalty after taking part in riots.
Amnesty accuses the Iranian leadership of using the death penalty to suppress dissent.
“The Iranian authorities are once again laying bare the depth of their disregard for the right to life and justice by threatening expedited executions and imposing death sentences in fast-tracked trials, only weeks after arrest,” said Diana Eltahawy, deputy regional director for the Middle East.
“In weaponising the death penalty, they are seeking to instil fear and crush the spirit of a population demanding fundamental change,” she added.

Ukrainians, scattered across Europe, trapped in limbo by war
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WARSAW/ISTANBUL, Feb 21 - Maryna Bondarenko says she has three suitcases packed in her apartment in Poland, waiting for the day when peace returns to Ukraine.
The 51-year-old journalist fled Kyiv with her son and mother after Russia launched its invasion on February 24, 2022. She thought they would be abroad for a month or two until the war ended.
Four years later, she is still there, working in a Ukrainian‑language newsroom that caters to a community of more than 1.5 million Ukrainians living in Poland.
"There were so many moments when we thought: 'This is it, we're finally going back.' We went to the post office several times, packed our belongings into boxes, absolutely certain that we were going back," she said.
Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has triggered the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two. More than 5 million Ukrainians are scattered across Europe, according to UN figures, many of them in Central and Eastern Europe.
SEPARATED FROM HUSBAND
Roughly three-quarters of the refugees are women and children, after Ukraine imposed martial law prohibiting men of military age from leaving the country.
Bondarenko longs to be reunited with her husband, Andrij Dudko, a 44-year-old former TV cameraman who is serving as a drone operator on the front line. But waves of Russian air strikes - which have cut power to tens of thousands of people in Kyiv during a bitter winter - convinced her to stay.
"We get ready to leave, and then there's another massive attack. We get ready again, and then cold winter comes and there is no heating, no power, no water. And I just can't bring my child there, under the rockets."
In Poland, large Ukrainian communities have sprung up in cities such as Warsaw and Krakow, sometimes prompting tensions with local residents who complain of the new arrivals taking welfare benefits and jobs.
"I want to go home, I really do. I know it won’t be easy," said Bondarenko, adding that the country she returns to will be profoundly changed.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government hopes that 70% of Ukrainians abroad will return, once the war ends. But surveys have shown that, over time, the share of Ukrainians who say they want to go back is declining.
For many among the younger generation of Ukrainians abroad - like Bondarenko's 11-year-old son Danylo - the country is a distant memory.
He likes Poland, despite experiencing some hostility toward Ukrainians in school.
"I don't really remember anyone from Ukraine. I remember I had one friend, but I do not really remember him and I’ve lost contact with him," he said. "I don't think that I will return to Ukraine."
'LIFE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY'
Iryna Kushnir and Olga Yermolenko, who were friends at high school in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, rekindled their friendship after they both fled to Istanbul at the start of the war, part of a far smaller number of Ukrainians who sought shelter in Turkey.
"I thought the war would end quickly, so I didn't plan to stay in Istanbul for long," said Kushnir, 42, who left her 19-year-old daughter Sofia behind in Ukraine to study.
But four years later, she is married to a Turkish man and has a teaching job at the Ukrainian department of Istanbul University.
"Like all Ukrainians, I planned to return home, but life turned out differently," said Kushnir, who says she is proud that her daughter has chosen to remain in Ukraine.
Her friend, Yermolenko, 43, works remotely from Istanbul as a financial specialist for Ukrainian clients. Her mother Tetyana, 73, still lives in Kharkiv and they are constantly in touch.
"I cannot say I am involved 100% in Turkish life. It is a bit strange feeling to be caught between your previous life and a possible future life," said Yermolenko, who has started learning Turkish. She still closely follows events in Ukraine but tries not to think about how long the war will last.
"I open the news - there's a Telegram channel that reports what's happening in Kharkiv in real time - and I see a missile flying toward my home," she said. "In that moment, the feeling is terrifying. I’m very scared. And of course, I immediately call my mom to make sure she's okay." REUTERS

Suspect in Ukraine assassination plot was pardoned in Moldova in 2022
It has emerged that a Moldovan national, who had a criminal record and was detained as part of a group plotting contract killings of Ukrainian politicians and public figures, was freed in 2022 under a presidential pardon from Maia Sandu. The president has now revoked the pardon.
Source: Аnticoruptie, a Moldovan online platform for reporting corruption and related crimes; European Pravda
Details: The authorities have identified one of the detained Moldovan nationals as Șepeli Nicolae Andrei, 30, who was convicted in Russia in 2017 for drug trafficking. He was transferred to Moldova in 2019 to serve his sentence and released in 2022 after a presidential pardon from Maia Sandu, following petitions from him and the prosecutor's office.
Sandu's administration said on 19 February that she has revoked the decision to pardon Șepeli "in connection with new circumstances provided by the competent authorities".
Earlier reports described a person matching Șepeli's profile – 30, convicted of drug offences, and released in 2022 – as the group's recruiter and a key figure.
Background:
- On 19 February, Moldovan law enforcement reported that Moldovan police and Ukrainian law enforcement bodies as part of a joint investigative team were conducting a criminal investigation into a plot to assassinate several public figures in Ukraine.
- The investigation found that members of the network had acted under the supervision of the Russian secret services. They collected information about the movements, places of residence and lifestyles of potential victims in order to organise their subsequent physical elimination for financial reward.
- Three individuals detained in Moldova have been placed in custody for 30 days.

French President Emmanuel Macron warned Saturday against celebrating too quickly after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, noting that Washington has already moved to impose new duties.
“We shouldn’t go too fast,” Macron said at the opening of the Paris International Agricultural Show, hours after Trump signed an executive order introducing a “temporary” 10 percent global tariff following the high court’s ruling.
“We will look precisely at the consequences, at what can be done, and we will adapt,” Macron said.

Germany news: Merz rallies base at Stuttgart CDU conference
Published February 21, 2026last updated February 21, 2026What you need to know
- CDU party conference resumes, with CSU leader Markus Söder due to attend
- Pro-EU demonstrations planned in several German and European cities
- The Berlin Film Festival wraps after an edition overshadowed by political controversy
Read below for updates of the main headlines from Germany on Saturday, February 21:
CDU delegates back ban on full-face coverings
Among the other issues CDU members voted on during their Stuttgart confab was one presented by the party's Women's Union aimed at banning facial coverings, specifically burqas, in public.
The ban would "outlaw the wearing of clothing that entirely or mostly covers an individual's face." Traditional Muslim clothing such as niqab and burqa were singled out by name.
The Women's Union said a general ban would, "strengthen the values of our liberal society and document our commitment to the rights and dignity of women." Further, the group said, "a open face is the basis for an open society and mutual respect."
CDU membership rejects proposed sugar tax
CDU party delegates in Stuttgart rejected a proposal to tax sugary drinks as a way to nudge consumers into making healthier drink choices.
The proposal was put forth by Schleswig-Holstein State Premier Daniel Günther, who pointed to the negative impact that sugary drinks have on the health of children.
Noting that roughly one-quarter of all German children are overweight, Günther said, "We need a tax that can affect behavioral change if we are to confront this massive health issue."
Günther said he hoped such a tax would force companies to put less sugar in their drinks.
CDU Deputy Secretary General Christina Stumpp on Saturday said, "A sugar tax isn't health policy, it's Green Party paternalism."
State leaders pledged to press on with their plan despite opposition from national party membership.
Schleswig-Holstein, which is governed by a CDU/Green Party coalition, has also announced steps aimed at banning the sale of sugar-laden energy drinks to children under the age of 16, something delegates in Stuttgart also declined to get behind — despite pleas from doctors and health experts.
Farm-industry-friendly Federal Food Minister Alois Rainer of the CDU's Bavarian sister party has already declared opposition to a sugar tax.
CDU opposed to further loosening debt limits
The conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) pledged opposition to any further loosening of the formerly sacrosanct federal debt limit, adopting a measure put forth by party chair, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
The debt limit is set in Germany's constitution, the Basic Law.
It was eased last year to make new defense investments possible, something the CDU's youth wing says contradicts the party's campaign promises, saying, "Further easing the debt brake, as the coalition agreement leaves open, would only further increase this contradiction."
The current CDU/CSU/SPD coalition has promised to "modernize the debt brake," appointing a commission to come up with rules changes.
But party members gathered in Stuttgart said the government must show that money from the initial easing had actually been invested — and not simply used for defense equipment purchases — before any new debt could be taken on by the states or the federal government.
CDU back call for no telephonic sick note
The CDU wants to end the option of getting a sick note by phone.
Delegates at the party's convention in Stuttgart backed the proposal from the party's business wing.
They argue that the easier it is to obtain a sick note, the more likely people are to make what they call a "bed-edge decision," choosing to call in sick without much hesitation. Replacing doctor visits with quick phone calls, they say, lowers the threshold even further.
CDU leader and Chancellor Friedrich Merz has previously criticized what he considers a high level of sick leave in Germany.
Health Minister Nina Warken, also from the CDU, now says the regulation will be reviewed.
Under current rules, patients who are already known to a practice and show only mild symptoms can receive a sick note by phone for up to five days. For any extension, they must see a doctor in person.
CDU backs social media limits for children
In its party conference on Saturday, the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) voted to introduce a minimum age for using social media platforms, as severalEuropean countries consider measures to restrict their use among children.
A party spokesperson was quoted by the German DPA news agency as saying that the party voted to "introduce a legal age limit of 14 for the use of social networks."
Australia last year enforced a law that blocks minors from having social media accounts on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Reddit nationwide for children under the age of 16 took effect on Wednesday.
Norway, Greece, the UK, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands are among a host of European countries discussing a similar form of ban, while the EU has increasingly moved toward supporting the principle.
CDU votes to reverse current naturalization time period
The conservative CDU party voted in its federal party conference on Saturday in favor of restoring a longer duration of time for migrants to be eligible to apply for naturalization.
Until June 2024, migrants had to live in Germany for at least eight years before they could apply for citizenship, barring a few exceptions. But that duration has since been amended to now stand at five years.
However, the CDU resolution argued that five years are not enough and that during this time "many immigrants are not yet sufficiently integrated into German society." They voted in favor of going back to eight years.
The 2024 law also allowed a fast-track of three years for those who can prove "special integration" into German society. This was scrapped after the now-ruling coalition government came to power in May 2025.
The passed resolution also calls for vetting those applying for citizenship more strictly to make sure they "agree with the principles of the constitution and the core values of our society," including gender equality, freedom of religion and sexual identity, the rejection of all forms of anti-semitism and racism and the commitment to Germany's historic responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.
CDU party conference votes to ban full face coverings nationwide
The conservative Christian Democratic Union party conference voted on Saturday in favor of a nationwide ban on full face coverings in public spaces, explicitly mentioning clothing such as the burqa or niqab, which some Muslim women wear.
The resolution was adopted by the majority of delegates meeting in Stuttgart. The ban would apply to any "clothing or coverings that completely or largely cover the face."
The motion was put forth by the Women's Union, who argued such a ban would "strengthen the values of our free society and demonstrate our commitment to women's rights and dignity."
"An open face is the basis of an open society and mutual respect," their statement read.
Those in favor of the motion also referenced other European countries where such a ban is in place including France, which became the first European country to take the controversial decision in 2010, Belgium and Austria, which also banned headscarves for girls under 14 in schools.
The bans were approved by the European Court of Human Rights, though other human rights organizations are often critical of such bans, warning they could trigger anti-Muslim sentiments.
German dies in Austria while skiing with son
A 61-year-old German man died on Friday in Austria during a ski trip with his son in the Silvretta Montafon ski area.
The man and his son were skiing together when they separated and planned to meet at a designated point, police said on Saturday.
The father never arrived and could not be reached by phone, prompting a search for him by his 15-year-old son, which later involved the lift company and the police.
They then tracked his phone to reveal he was still in the ski area, ultimately locating him lifeless under a tree in the snow.
The exact cause of death is unclear. Police say he had fallen.
A spokesperson said off-piste skiing is permitted in the area where the incident occurred.
Austria was hit by heavy snowfall Thursday into Friday, which grounded many flights at Vienna's airport, caused many road accidents and closures and raised the avalanche risk to a level four out of five.
Berlinale finale comes amid political controversy
The 76th Berlin Film Festival comes to a close on Saturday after an edition that saw much controversy surrounding the role of politics in filmmaking.
During the opening ceremony of the Berlinale, 10 days ago, jury president Wim Wenders unleashed a storm of controversy when he responded to a question about the German government's support for Israel and by extension the festival's alleged bias by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."
Several artists pulled out of the festival following his statements, most notably award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy. Due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, Roy announced she was dropping out, denouncing Wender's words as "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping."
On Tuesday, dozens of film industry figures condemned in a letter the festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians.
The letter was drafted by the Film Workers for Palestine collective, with signatories including Javier Bardem, Tilda Switon and Adam McKay.
Director Tricia Tuttle, responsible for the festival's creative direction and management, firmly rejected the accusations, describing some of them as "misinformation" and "inaccurate."
CDU resumes federal party conference
The conservative Christian Democratic Union resumes on Saturday its federal party conference, after a first successful day which saw the reelection of Chancellor Friedrich Merz as party leader.
The conference is taking place in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, where state elections are scheduled on March 8.
The conference is due to discuss on Saturday several motions, following numerous political proposals discussed in preparation.
Markus Söder, the leader of CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is among those due to attend on Saturday.

But party members gathered in Stuttgart said the government must show that money from the initial easing had actually been invested — and not simply used for defense equipment purchases — before any new debt could be taken on by the states or the federal government.
CDU back call for no telephonic sick note
The CDU wants to end the option of getting a sick note by phone.
Delegates at the party's convention in Stuttgart backed the proposal from the party's business wing.
They argue that the easier it is to obtain a sick note, the more likely people are to make what they call a "bed-edge decision," choosing to call in sick without much hesitation. Replacing doctor visits with quick phone calls, they say, lowers the threshold even further.
CDU leader and Chancellor Friedrich Merz has previously criticized what he considers a high level of sick leave in Germany.
Health Minister Nina Warken, also from the CDU, now says the regulation will be reviewed.
Under current rules, patients who are already known to a practice and show only mild symptoms can receive a sick note by phone for up to five days. For any extension, they must see a doctor in person.
CDU backs social media limits for children
In its party conference on Saturday, the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) voted to introduce a minimum age for using social media platforms, as severalEuropean countries consider measures to restrict their use among children.
A party spokesperson was quoted by the German DPA news agency as saying that the party voted to "introduce a legal age limit of 14 for the use of social networks."
Australia last year enforced a law that blocks minors from having social media accounts on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook and Reddit nationwide for children under the age of 16 took effect on Wednesday.
Norway, Greece, the UK, Denmark, Italy and the Netherlands are among a host of European countries discussing a similar form of ban, while the EU has increasingly moved toward supporting the principle.
CDU votes to reverse current naturalization time period
The conservative CDU party voted in its federal party conference on Saturday in favor of restoring a longer duration of time for migrants to be eligible to apply for naturalization.
Until June 2024, migrants had to live in Germany for at least eight years before they could apply for citizenship, barring a few exceptions. But that duration has since been amended to now stand at five years.
However, the CDU resolution argued that five years are not enough and that during this time "many immigrants are not yet sufficiently integrated into German society." They voted in favor of going back to eight years.
The 2024 law also allowed a fast-track of three years for those who can prove "special integration" into German society. This was scrapped after the now-ruling coalition government came to power in May 2025.
The passed resolution also calls for vetting those applying for citizenship more strictly to make sure they "agree with the principles of the constitution and the core values of our society," including gender equality, freedom of religion and sexual identity, the rejection of all forms of anti-semitism and racism and the commitment to Germany's historic responsibility for the crimes of the Nazi regime.
CDU party conference votes to ban full face coverings nationwide
The conservative Christian Democratic Union party conference voted on Saturday in favor of a nationwide ban on full face coverings in public spaces, explicitly mentioning clothing such as the burqa or niqab, which some Muslim women wear.
The resolution was adopted by the majority of delegates meeting in Stuttgart. The ban would apply to any "clothing or coverings that completely or largely cover the face."
The motion was put forth by the Women's Union, who argued such a ban would "strengthen the values of our free society and demonstrate our commitment to women's rights and dignity."
"An open face is the basis of an open society and mutual respect," their statement read.
Those in favor of the motion also referenced other European countries where such a ban is in place including France, which became the first European country to take the controversial decision in 2010, Belgium and Austria, which also banned headscarves for girls under 14 in schools.
The bans were approved by the European Court of Human Rights, though other human rights organizations are often critical of such bans, warning they could trigger anti-Muslim sentiments.
German dies in Austria while skiing with son
A 61-year-old German man died on Friday in Austria during a ski trip with his son in the Silvretta Montafon ski area.
The man and his son were skiing together when they separated and planned to meet at a designated point, police said on Saturday.
The father never arrived and could not be reached by phone, prompting a search for him by his 15-year-old son, which later involved the lift company and the police.
They then tracked his phone to reveal he was still in the ski area, ultimately locating him lifeless under a tree in the snow.
The exact cause of death is unclear. Police say he had fallen.
A spokesperson said off-piste skiing is permitted in the area where the incident occurred.
Austria was hit by heavy snowfall Thursday into Friday, which grounded many flights at Vienna's airport, caused many road accidents and closures and raised the avalanche risk to a level four out of five.
Berlinale finale comes amid political controversy
The 76th Berlin Film Festival comes to a close on Saturday after an edition that saw much controversy surrounding the role of politics in filmmaking.
During the opening ceremony of the Berlinale, 10 days ago, jury president Wim Wenders unleashed a storm of controversy when he responded to a question about the German government's support for Israel and by extension the festival's alleged bias by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."
Several artists pulled out of the festival following his statements, most notably award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy. Due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, Roy announced she was dropping out, denouncing Wender's words as "unconscionable" and "jaw-dropping."
On Tuesday, dozens of film industry figures condemned in a letter the festival's "silence on the genocide of Palestinians.
The letter was drafted by the Film Workers for Palestine collective, with signatories including Javier Bardem, Tilda Switon and Adam McKay.
Director Tricia Tuttle, responsible for the festival's creative direction and management, firmly rejected the accusations, describing some of them as "misinformation" and "inaccurate."
CDU resumes federal party conference
The conservative Christian Democratic Union resumes on Saturday its federal party conference, after a first successful day which saw the reelection of Chancellor Friedrich Merz as party leader.
The conference is taking place in the southwestern city of Stuttgart, where state elections are scheduled on March 8.
The conference is due to discuss on Saturday several motions, following numerous political proposals discussed in preparation.
Markus Söder, the leader of CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is among those due to attend on Saturday.
Welcome to our coverage

Lebanon condemns deadly Israeli strikes on south and east
Lebanon's president on Saturday condemned deadly Israeli attacks on his country carried out a day prior, the latest despite a ceasefire with group Hezbollah.
In a statement, Joseph Aoun called the attacks "a blatant act of aggression aimed at thwarting diplomatic efforts" by the United States and other nations to establish stability.
A lawmaker from Hezbollah called on Beirut to suspend meetings of a multinational committee tasked with monitoring the truce.
Washington is one of five members on the committee overseeing the ceasefire implemented in November 2024, with the body scheduled to meet again next week.
Israel has repeatedly bombed Lebanon despite the ceasefire.
The Friday attacks on southern and eastern Lebanon killed 12 people, according to the health ministry, 10 of them in the east of the country.
Israel's military claimed it struck "several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres in the Baalbek area".
Hezbollah said a commander was killed in the raids. Its lawmaker Rami Abu Hamdan said on Saturday the group "will not accept the authorities acting as mere political analysts, dismissing these as Israeli strikes we have grown accustomed to before every meeting of the committee".
He called on Beirut to "suspend the committee's meetings until the enemy ceases its attacks".
Hezbollah, while weakened following war with Israel, remains a strong political force in Lebanon represented in parliament.
Lebanon's government last year committed to disarming the group, with the army saying last month it had completed the first phase of the plan covering the area near the Israeli border.
Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of rearming since the war, has called the Lebanese army's progress on disarming the group insufficient.

Women's rights documentary ‘River Dreams’ makes historic Berlinale premiere
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-21
10:04:48 UTC
19:04:48 KST

For the first time in its history, a Kazakh documentary has premiered at the Berlinale’s Forum section — one of the world’s most influential film festivals. ‘River Dreams’, the debut feature by director Kristina Mikhailova, gives voice to women imagining life beyond male dominance.
It was a celebratory day for the ‘River Dreams’ team, who seemed to enjoy every moment of their historic premiere. The first Kazakh documentary to screen at the Berlinale drew strong interest, with the screening sold out.
The audience reacted emotionally — at times laughing, at times visibly moved. Several of the film’s protagonists travelled to Berlin for the premiere, joining director Kristina Mikhailova to mark her feature debut.
The screening was followed by a Q&A session, though not everyone in the packed theatre had the chance to ask their questions or share their impressions.
Where the river begins
There is a river in Kazakhstan called Aksay. It begins in the glaciers of the Zailiyskiy Alatau mountains near Almaty and flows down to the Kapchagai reservoir.
Along its energetic waters, Mikhailova and her crew meet girls and young women who are asked to imagine themselves as a river.
Along this route, city dwellers, LGBT and gender-positivity activists, a headmistress, women in prison and students dreaming of emigration speak about their fears, desires and imagined futures.
What began as a poetic exploration of female voices through the metaphor of a river gradually evolved into a political portrait shaped by the violence and structural inequality many of these women have experienced.
With what the director describes as “radical tenderness,” the film invites viewers into a shared emotional landscape where the movement of water mirrors the instability many women face in Kazakhstan today.
For Mikhailova the Berlinale premiere is both exciting and validating.
“A debut film is always a statement of who you are as an author,” says Mikhailova. “After premiering at a major festival, the level of trust in you grows.”
‘River Dreams’ was selected for the Berlinale’s Forum Special — a section that runs alongside the main programme and is dedicated to formally bold and politically engaged cinema.
This year’s Forum Special carries the motto “Be Human Only, Dish Out the Truth,” a curatorial focus that resonates strongly with the film’s uncompromising tone.
For the film’s producer, Dana Sabitova, the selection carries symbolic weight. “Through their choices, the selectors make a statement about what they want the festival to stand for,” she says. “The fact that they chose a documentary from Kazakhstan means that our voices matter to them.”
From call to screen
Five years ago, an unusual call circulated online among girls and young women under the age of 30 living along the Aksay riverbank: “Come and give us an interview if you feel like a river.”
Nearly 100 young women responded. Twenty-five participated in in-depth interviews lasting up to three hours. Ultimately, 15 became the protagonists of the film.
Filming took place in two stages, in 2022 and 2024. Between these production periods, Kazakhstan was shaken by the killing of 31-year-old Saltanat Nukenova by her husband, former economy minister Kuandyk Bishimbayev — a case that sparked nationwide debate about domestic violence and women’s rights.
Many of the film’s participants described the event as a painful confirmation of the vulnerabilities women face in the country.
After witnessing such openness and vulnerability from her protagonists, Mikhailova says she felt compelled to place herself in the same position of exposure. She decided to appear in the film and give an interview herself.
“If I was asking them to share something deeply personal and trust me, I had to go through the same experience myself. I needed to step in front of the camera. Only then did it feel honest,” she says.
A fragile road to Berlin
The journey to Berlin was far from straightforward. When Mikhailova first learned about the selection, the film had not yet completed post-production. Due to limited funding, the team submitted a picture lock to the festival selectors while still searching for resources to finalise the film.
Their strategy was clear: selection by a major festival could help unlock finishing funds. The gamble paid off. Following the announcement, the team secured last-minute investment to complete post-production.
Yet financial challenges continued. As an independent production, ‘River Dreams’ had no institutional backing. Together with producer Dana Sabitova, Mikhailova sought support to cover travel and promotional expenses for the Berlinale premiere.
According to the director, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Culture declined to provide funding, reportedly stating that the film was not part of the main competition.
For Mikhailova, the situation reflects a broader reality faced by independent filmmakers in the country. Without consistent institutional support structures, many are forced to rely on personal networks and piecemeal financing.
In the case of ‘River Dreams’, financial support from Switzerland and the United Kingdom was limited due to the absence of formal co-production frameworks involving Kazakhstan.
Much of the production was sustained by the director’s and producer’s own resources, including years of unpaid labour.
Despite the obstacles, Mikhailova views the journey as proof that persistence matters. “Our example shows that if you truly believe in a project, it is possible,” she says. “It’s a form of inspiration and empowerment.”
Beyond Berlin
The team is expected to announce participation in two additional international festivals in the coming months. Yet for Mikhailova, the most meaningful milestone would be a premiere at home.
She says she would be especially honoured to screen ‘River Dreams’ at the Qyzqaras Festival, which celebrates films made by women.
Beyond the festival circuit, the director hopes for a theatrical release in Kazakhstan — a rare opportunity for documentary cinema in the country, where non-fiction films seldom reach the big screen.
“The most important step for us now is distribution in Kazakhstan,” she says. “This film is meant first and foremost to inspire Kazakh women, not only activists or people from the urban bubble, but every woman.”

HK$200 million Mark Six draw to be split across 5 winning bets
‘I hope there is good fortune in the new year,’ one resident says ahead of Saturday night’s draw
The first prize for the Year of the Horse’s Mark Six snowball draw on Saturday is set to be split across five winning bets, with each garnering a payout of about HK$42.2 million (US$5.4 million).
The total turnover for the draw reached HK$402.3 million – 6.45 times the total turnover of the HK$62.4 million recorded for the previous draw earlier this week. This lottery’s HK$200 million first prize fund is the highest in its history.
The winning numbers were 2, 18, 34, 35, 37 and 49, with 33 being the special number.
Five winning units shared the first prize, with each netting about HK$42.2 million. The second prize will be spread across 13.5 winning units, with each garnering around HK$1.1 million. The third prize had 641.5 winning units, with each to receive HK$63,650.
Earlier on Saturday, snaking queues formed at betting branches across Hong Kong as residents snapped up tickets for the draw.
Resident Wong Chun-hung, who works in sales and marketing, said he spent HK$20 on bets using numbers randomly generated by the system.
“I hope there is good fortune in the new year,” he said. “Good luck can come at any time.”

‘Belongs to everyone’: wheelchair dancers move beyond boundaries in Hong Kong
‘Beauty isn’t about how we execute difficult moves ... but about those moments when we immerse ourselves together,’ choreographer says
At a rehearsal studio in Hong Kong on an early February morning, a group of 12 dancers gathered around a table, hands on deck and eyes locked in intense glances.
They slammed the counter in unison. Then they twisted and turned their bodies with fierce precision, as a wave of energy swept through the room. Half stood, while the others moved in wheelchairs.
The dancers dispersed into the four corners of the room. Evina Wong Wai-king, a 65-year-old wheelchair dancer, lifted her hand. Tilting her head upwards, she closed her eyes.
The dancers were rehearsing for Wayfaring Beyond, a collaboration between the Hong Kong Dance Company (HKDance) and the China Hong Kong Para Dance Sport Association.
The barrier-free performance, which offers free admission, is one of 11 featured in inclusive arts festival No Limits. It will be held at Tai Kwun in Central on February 28 and March 1.
“Beauty isn’t about how we execute difficult moves ... but about those moments when we [dancers] immerse ourselves together in rehearsals, getting to know one another and paying full attention to each other’s bodies. These are the moments I find incredibly beautiful,” said Ong Tze-shen, choreographer of Wayfaring Beyond and HKDance principal dancer.

EU bans Chinese bodies from critical tech programmes, including AI and chips
Chinese space scientist Wu Ji doubts the policy will hurt China much and may instead ‘make Europe appear more isolated’
Researchers in China have been excluded from the European Union’s most advanced collaborative technology programmes.
However, specialists in the sectors affected say the impact of the ban may be limited because some areas of collaboration are already at a historic low.
The EU has barred organisations based in China from applying for its €93 billion (US$110 billion) Horizon Europe grants in “critical areas”, citing concerns over research security and potential military use. Effective this year, the ban covers areas including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technologies, semiconductors and biotechnology.
Researchers outside China applying in those fields must also prove that partner institutions are not directly owned or controlled by Chinese organisations.
The new rules, released in December, devoted five pages specifically to restrictions on China.

Switzerland, the country of four seas

Switzerland, the country of four seas
Switzerland is a landlocked country with no direct access to the sea. Yet it is connected to four seas. What sounds paradoxical is a geographical peculiarity in Europe: rain and meltwater from the Swiss Alps flow into four different seas.
A drop of rain that falls in the Swiss Alps can at some point later flow into the sea with millions of others in very different places: into the North Sea, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea or the Adriatic.
This is made possible by Switzerland’s special location in the heart of Europe. The Alps form one of the continent’s most important watersheds.
It is from their passes and peaks that the path of the water is decided – often over thousands of kilometres into one of these four seas.
The ‘water castle of Europe’
Since the 19th century, Switzerland has been known as the “water castle of Europe”. Although it stores only a small proportion of Europe’s fresh water, many large rivers originate in Switzerland or receive a significant amount of water from the country. The four most important are the Rhine, the Rhône, the Ticino and the Inn.
According to the Swiss Academy of Sciences (SCNAT)External link, around 65% of the country’s surface drains via the Aare, Reuss and Rhine through Germany, northern France and the Netherlands towards the North Sea.
Around a quarter of the runoff from Switzerland follows the route through southern France to the western Mediterranean via the Rhône and Lake Geneva.
The southern part of the Swiss water reaches the Adriatic Sea via the Ticino and the Po through Italy, while the Inn flows from the Engadine via the Danube into the Black Sea, through Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine.
The Gotthard massif, from which most of these rivers originate, plays a central role. From a hydrographic perspective, Switzerland is therefore considered a European hub in terms of various water parameters.
A special geographical feature is located at the Lunghin Pass in canton GraubündenExternal link, where the catchment areas of the North Sea, Adriatic and Black Sea meet.
Such so-called triple watersheds or triple points, where water can flow in three directions, are rare worldwide.
In North America, the Triple Divide Peak in Montana is well known, and in Australia there are similar points inland. However, unlike there, in Switzerland these are not remote places, but a densely populated, economically strongly networked area in the heart of Europe.
Water reserves of continental importance
With an average annual rainfall of around 1,500 millimetres and numerous natural reservoirs – the largest of which are Lake Geneva and Lake Constance – Switzerland has above-average water resources.
Because clouds accumulate in the Alps, it rains more here than in many other countries. According to MeteoSwissExternal link, the annual amount of precipitation that falls over the whole of Switzerland is roughly equivalent to the capacity of Lake Constance.
In addition to the drinking water supply and agriculture, these water resources play an important role in energy production in Switzerland.
Depending on the annual amount of rainfall, between 55% and 60% of domestic electricity is produced from hydropower.
This makes Switzerland one of the leading hydropower countries in Europe. The storage and pumped-storage power plants in the Alpine region with their reservoirs not only supply electricity for Switzerland’s own needs, but also contribute to grid stability in neighbouring countries.
Glacier shrinkage and contaminated groundwater
However, Switzerland’s “water castle” is also built on ice: Switzerland’s water resources have been dwindling for decades due to the increasing retreat of large glaciers in the Alps.
As a result, source areas are shifting, water runoff is becoming more irregular and new storage and protection strategies are becoming necessary because melting glaciers can also significantly increase natural hazards.
For example, on May 28, 2025, the Birch Glacier above the Valais village of Blatten broke off and buried almost the entire village. Blatten is to be rebuilt with a strict, risk-based safety concept.
Due to climate change, Switzerland has also been struggling with more drought recently. A new national monitoring and warning system is to secure the water supply for the future.
Glacier retreat and increasing drought are also causing a shortage of groundwater, which in the Central Plateau is often contaminated by pesticide residues and nitrate pollution.
However, experts say the groundwater in Switzerland can continue to supply the population with a very stable supply for many decades to come.
Responsibility downstream
As a water reservoir, Switzerland also has a great responsibility towards the countries in the lower reaches of its numerous rivers. As already mentioned, the waters connect Switzerland with over a dozen neighbouring and riparian countries.
Both the quantity and the quality of the water that flows out of Switzerland have an impact on millions of people and river animals outside the country’s borders.
This was demonstrated by the chemical accident at Schweizerhalle in 1986External link, when a warehouse containing chemicals at the Sandoz company burned down and the Rhine was poisoned. The pictures of the dead fish went around the world.
Or the dispute over the discharge volume of Lake Maggiore, the level of which is regulated at the end of the lake in Italy. Heavy rainfall can cause this lake to rise sharply within a short space of time.
This results in cross-border obligations: in flood protection, in the preservation of ecosystems and in water management in times of increasing drought.
This is why Switzerland is actively involved in international organisations such as the International Commission for the Protection of the RhineExternal link and the World Water CouncilExternal link to promote common standards and early warning systems. Although Switzerland does not touch any seas or oceans, it is closer to them than you might think.

Ukraine’s army liberates 300 square kilometers from invaders – Zelenskyy
Ukrainian defenders on the southern sector of the front managed to liberate a territory of 300 square kilometers from the Russian occupiers, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
"I won’t go into too many details," Zelensky said of the advances, "but today I can congratulate our army first and foremost – all the defence forces – because as of today, 300 (square) kilometres have been liberated," Zelenskyy said in an interview with AFP.
The president did not specify the time frame over which the releases took place.
He added that Ukrainian forces are advancing in the south.
Ukraine is taking advantage of the disruptions to Russian Starlink terminals, he said, though Ukrainian defenders have also experienced outages.
"There are problems, there are challenges," he said, acknowledging that the setbacks faced by Russia are "much more serious."

Iran’s top diplomat demands Trump prove 32,000 protest deaths claim

Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday rejected U.S. claims that 32,000 civilians were killed during unrest in Iran, saying Tehran has published its official figures and urging Washington to provide proof for any higher casualty estimates.
"You know, the people of Iran are a lot different than the leaders of Iran, and it's very, very, very sad situation," U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday, adding that 32,000 people were killed there over a "relatively short period of time."
In remarks through social media platform X, Araghchi said Tehran had already fulfilled its "pledge of full transparency" by publishing an official list documenting 3,117 victims of what he described as "recent terrorist operations," including around 200 security personnel.
He added that "if anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence."
Earlier Friday, Trump said he was "considering" a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal, without providing further details.
The latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, according to official figures.
Iranian authorities accused the U.S. and Israel of backing what they described as "rioting" and "terrorism."
Iran and the U.S. resumed nuclear negotiations earlier this month in the Omani capital Muscat, followed by another round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday under Oman's mediation.
The renewed diplomacy comes amid heightened regional tensions, fueled by a significant U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf, as well as Iranian military drills.
Trump, speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, warned that the U.S. would opt for military action against Iran "within 10 to 15 days" if negotiations fail.

Italian toddler dies after transplant with heart 'burned by frostbite'
A toddler in Italy who received a damaged donor heart has died, the family's lawyer has said.
Two-year-old Domenico died shortly before 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT) on Saturday, Francesco Petruzzi told reporters. Monaldi Hospital, where he was being treated, said he had suffered a "sudden and irreversible worsening of his clinical condition".
The heart given to Domenico during a transplant in late December was reportedly transported to the hospital in direct contact with dry ice, causing severe tissue damage.
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident and six medics have been placed under formal investigation in a case which has sparked outrage in Italy.
Petruzzi has said the organ arrived "burned by frostbite" after being transported over 800km (490 miles) from Bolzano to Naples in an unsuitable container alongside the ice, without a thermometer to alert the medical team to the low temperature.
The two-year-old had been on life support in Naples for almost two months. His mother Patrizia Mercolino had appealed to the Pope to help her son.
"It's over. Domenico is gone," Mercolino told reporters on Saturday.
She said a foundation would be established in his name.
The family's lawyer said the foundation would be for "all children who cannot have a transplant and to help all victims of malpractice and medical negligence".
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the "whole of Italy mourns the loss of little Domenico, a warrior who will never be forgotten".
She wrote on X: "On behalf of myself and the government, I offer my sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his mother Patrizia, his father Antonio and all his loved ones.
"I am certain that the competent authorities will shed full light on this terrible incident."
On Wednesday, a panel of paediatric specialists concluded Domenico's condition was "not compatible" with another transplant.
Doctors had warned a prolonged use of the life support system might have compromised his lungs, liver and kidneys.
Petruzzi said at the time the family wanted to see all the relevant medical records: "If the time for hope has ended, then the time for responsibility has begun."
Italy's Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said earlier this week that "we must absolutely clarify what happened".
"We owe it to the child, to the family, but also to all Italians."
"We have an excellent national health service, which has been able to handle and almost always resolve complex situations. So, I believe citizens should not lose faith."

Mikel Arteta’s men are in danger of blowing a commanding position in the title race after successive draws against Brentford and Wolves left them with just two wins in their last seven league matches.
The Gunners squandered the lead in both matches, with Wednesday’s 2-2 draw at bottom-of-the-table Wolves especially galling as they conceded a stoppage-time equaliser having led 2-0.
Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side will move two points behind Arsenal if they beat Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Meanwhile, Tottenham’s new coach, Igor Tudor, faces a baptism of fire in his first game in charge of the club as he is tasked with steering Spurs out of a relegation battle.
Thomas Frank was sacked as Tottenham manager following the defeat to Newcastle earlier in February, as a dire domestic campaign has left Spurs in 16th place going into the weekend, just five points above the relegation zone.
Saka urges Arsenal to ‘get over the line’
On February 7, Arsenal players walked off the field after a convincing 3-0 home win against Sunderland with their lead in the Premier League at nine points. Then things started to go wrong.
Defiant Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka is adamant his side will eventually “get over the line” and end their trophy drought.
After allowing City to overhaul them in the 2023 and 2024 title races, the north Londoners, who have not won silverware since the 2020 FA Cup, face pointed questions about their ability to handle the mounting tension.
Saka said Arsenal must silence the doubters by getting back on track at archrivals Tottenham on Sunday.
“I believe the next few years are going to be the years that we get over the line, and we’re able to win trophies and make history for this club,” Saka said. “We’re back where we belong, fighting for everything.”
Arteta dismisses ‘bottlers’ talk
Arsenal’s boss rejected the term “bottlers’ ahead of Sunday’s Premier League visit to Tottenham Hotspur.
“It’s not part of my vocabulary and I don’t see it like this because I don’t think anybody wants to do that as an intention,” Arteta told reporters on Friday, when asked about the term being used regarding their latest wobble in the title race.
“That’s individual opinion, perspective. You have to respect that. That’s what I said after in the press conference. You lose two points against Wolves in the manner that the game played out, you have to take it on the chin. It’s part of our role.”
“What I’m very interested in is the next one, what we are made of, what we love about this and how we write our own destiny from here.”
‘No time to find excuses’
Tottenham Hotspur’s new interim head coach Tudor says instilling the players with confidence is his most urgent task.
“First priority is to give everything the team needs in these moments. The team need, I believe, first of all, to get some confidence, to get some courage, but also, in same way, the concrete things in the pitch,” Tudor told Spursplay.
“Of course, I’m coming here knowing that situation is not easy. There is no time to find excuses. What I said from the first day here, each of us, need to give something more, something extra.”
He added: “The position of the club in this moment is one that nobody can accept. Every Tottenham fan cannot accept the situation. We are aware of that. But it’s not enough to just be aware of that.”
Tudor wants a team prepared to ‘suffer’
While Tudor is aware of the significance of a derby win over Arsenal, he is more concerned with building a strong team spirit to help fuel their survival bid.
“I understand the importance of this game. This is a derby, a north London derby,” he said.
“This is a team that is full of quality, full of talented players, with good motor engines. But my goal in these first training sessions is that we become a team, with a really right way of going to war.
“A team who want to suffer. To fight, to run, to have the right mentality. This is the start.”
Head-to-head
Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have locked horns on 212 occasions; Arsenal won 90 of the games, while Spurs won 67, and 55 were draws.
Arsenal are now unbeaten against Spurs in their last seven games. Earlier this season, Eberechi Eze scored a hat-trick in November as the Gunners thrashed Tottenham 4-1 at the Emirates.
Arteta’s side also did the double over their bitter local rivals in 2024-25, winning 1-0 at Tottenham and earning a 2-1 victory at home.
Tottenham’s team news
Spurs were dealt a big blow when promising young winger Wilson Odobert ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against Newcastle.
He joins a long injury list of players who will miss the derby, including James Maddison, Ben Davies, Dejan Kulusevski, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, Destiny Udogie, Kevin Danso and Lucas Bergvall.
Cristian Romero will serve the second of his four-game suspension after the Spurs captain was sent off in the defeat to Man United earlier this month.
Brazilian forward Richarlison is back in training after a knock and could be available for selection, while Pedro Porro faces a late fitness test as he looks to return from injury.
Predicted starting XI:
Vicario (GK); Palhinha, Dragusin, Van de Ven; Gray, Gallagher, Sarr, Spence; Kolo Muani, Simons; Solanke
Arsenal’s team news
Versatile midfielder Mikel Merino has undergone surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot, an injury sustained in January, and could miss the rest of the season.
Leandro Trossard is a serious doubt for the derby after he went off injured in stoppage time against the Wolves.
But Arteya has said he hopes to have captain Martin Odegaard and Kai Havertz available for selection after they were struggling with injuries, and youngster Max Dowman has returned to training after an ankle problem.
And while Saka also limped off against Wolves, he is expected to be declared fit for this match.
Predicted starting XI:
Raya (GK); Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Hincapie; Odegaard, Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Jesus, Martinelli

How U.S. Navy F-16 jets support adversary training
United Kingdom

The U.S. Navy operates a small fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons in a dedicated adversary role, using the aircraft to replicate current and emerging threat fighters during advanced training exercises.
Assigned primarily to the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at Naval Air Station Fallon, Nevada, the F-16s support high-end training for carrier air wings and other fleet units. In this role, the aircraft are used to simulate the tactics, performance characteristics and employment methods of potential adversaries, providing realistic opposition in complex air combat scenarios.
According to Naval Air Systems Command, the Navy’s F-16A and F-16B variants are single-engine, multi-role fighters capable of air-to-air and air-to-surface missions. In Navy service, however, their primary function is as adversary fighters. The aircraft enable dissimilar air combat training, helping frontline squadrons prepare for engagements against capable peer threats.
The Navy’s F-16s are equipped with fly-by-wire flight controls, inertial navigation systems and AN/APG-66 or -68 radar systems. The type’s agility and performance envelope make it well suited to replicate advanced fourth-generation fighters in training scenarios. Specifications published by NAVAIR list a maximum speed of approximately Mach 1.7 and a service ceiling of 50,000 feet.
The fleet includes both single-seat F-16A and two-seat F-16B aircraft, with the latter used to support training and familiarisation tasks. The aircraft entered Navy service in the early 2000s, with an initial operational capability date of 2002.
Some of the Navy’s F-16 airframes trace their origins to aircraft originally built for Pakistan in the early 1990s but placed in storage following a U.S. arms embargo. These low-hour aircraft were later transferred to U.S. service, where they were adapted for the adversary mission.
Beyond their operational flying, the Navy’s F-16s are supported through contractor logistics and sustainment arrangements to ensure continued availability for high-tempo training cycles. The aircraft form part of a broader adversary enterprise that includes other platforms used to replicate a range of air threats.

‘Europe is terribly afraid that the war will end!’ Expert shares his thoughts on Ukraine negotiations

News of the story
"On Point"
MINSK, 20 February (BelTA) - Europe is terribly afraid that the war in Ukraine will end, Sergei Karnaukhov, PhD in Law, expert on security services, said in a new episode of the V Teme [On Point] project on BelTA’s YouTube channel.
As was noted, February is associated with two events from different years: the Maidan took place in Ukraine 14 years ago and the special military operation began four years ago. Their interconnection is obvious.
The expert explained that this February has a completely new context for him. “We must see and assess the important events happening in the world. Difficult negotiations are underway involving Russia, Ukraine, and now also with an alliance of countries. Just the other day, when the negotiations were on, the British entered the hall where our delegation was. Then out of nowhere, Germans, French, and Italians showed up there. What does this mean? It means that Europe is terribly afraid that the war will end,” he emphasized.
Sergey Karnaukhov noted the importance of assessing what is happening in an objective way. “Let's be open and honest about what is going on. We think that there are countries around us that have retained common sense and humanitarian values, that someone is ready for a world that is understandable from our point of view. In reality it is a no,” he stated, referring to the context of the actions by the United States of America, particularly the U.S. steps against Iran.

Venezuela grants amnesty to 379 political prisoners
The move is in line with a new law, giving hope to throngs of others jailed over alleged plots to oust the government.
Venezuelan authorities have granted amnesty to 379 political prisoners, according to a lawmaker, after a new law was enacted by interim authorities following the United States’ abduction of President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuela’s National Assembly unanimously adopted the law on Thursday, providing hope that hundreds of political prisoners may soon be released.

National Assembly deputy Jorge Arreaza, the lawmaker overseeing the amnesty process, said in a televised interview on Friday that the 379 prisoners “must be released, granted amnesty, between tonight and tomorrow morning”.
“Requests have been submitted by the Public Prosecutor’s Office to the competent courts to grant amnesty measures,” he said.
Opposition figures have criticised the new legislation, which appears to include carve-outs for some offences previously used by authorities to target Maduro’s political opponents.
It explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for “promoting” or “facilitating … armed or forceful actions” against Venezuela’s sovereignty by foreign actors.
Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has levelled such accusations against opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who hopes to return to Venezuela at some point from the US.
The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of “terrorism”-related activities.
Arreaza said earlier that “the military justice system will handle” relevant cases for members of the armed forces, “and grant benefits where appropriate”.
Hundreds have already been granted conditional release by President Rodriguez’s government since the deadly US raid that seized Maduro.
‘Amnesty is not automatic’
The NGO Foro Penal had said before the announcement that about 650 were detained, a toll that has not been updated since.
Foro Penal director Alfredo Romero said on Friday that receiving “amnesty is not automatic”, but would require a process in the courts, viewed by many as an arm of Maduro’s repression.
Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a Machado ally, announced his release from detention shortly after the bill was passed.
Earlier this month, he had been freed from prison but then quickly re-detained and kept under house arrest.
“I am now completely free,” Guanipa wrote on social media. He called for all other political prisoners to be freed and exiles to be allowed to return.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Maduro – who was taken to New York to stand trial on drug trafficking and other charges.
Rodriguez was formerly Maduro’s vice president and took his place as the South American country’s leader with the consent of US President Donald Trump, if she toed Washington’s line.
The US has taken over control of Venezuela’s oil sales, with Trump promising a share for Washington in the profits.

Death toll from Israeli strike on eastern Lebanon rises to 10, over 30 injured
Israeli raids ‘represent new violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and clear breach of international obligations,’ says President Aoun
BEIRUT
The death toll from an Israeli airstrike that hit a building in the town of Riyaq in Baalbek district, eastern Lebanon, rose to 10, with more than 30 people injured, in a preliminary count, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency NNA.
NNA reported on Friday evening that 10 people were killed, and more than 30 injuries were recorded in a non-final toll following an Israeli strike on a building in Riyaq, adding that search and rescue operations were still ongoing beneath the rubble.
Meanwhile, the Lebanese group Hezbollah announced the death of one of its leaders, Hussein Mohammad Yaghi, following the Israeli strikes on Riyaq.
Earlier on Friday evening, Israeli warplanes carried out a series of airstrikes on several areas in the Baalbek district of eastern Lebanon. One of the strikes targeted a building in Riyaq, completely destroying it, according to the agency.
Israeli aircraft also carried out two strikes on the plains of the towns of Qasr Naba and Tamnine al-Tahta in Baalbek, as well as three strikes on the Shaara area along the foothills of the eastern Lebanon mountain range.
On Saturday, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun warned that the ongoing Israeli attacks “constitute a blatant hostile act aimed at undermining diplomatic efforts undertaken by Lebanon with sisterly and friendly countries, foremost among them the United States, to consolidate stability and halt Israeli hostilities against Lebanon.”
Aoun said the raids “represent a new violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty and a clear breach of international obligations,” adding that they reflect “a disregard for the will of the international community, particularly UN resolutions calling for full compliance with Resolution 1701 and its complete implementation.”
He renewed his call on countries sponsoring regional stability to “assume their responsibilities to immediately halt the attacks and exert pressure to ensure respect for international resolutions, in a manner that preserves Lebanon’s sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and spares the region further escalation and tension.”
The latest attacks came amid repeated Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024, killing and wounding hundreds of Lebanese. Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.

CIA retracts or revises 19 intelligence assessments over political bias concerns
Director John Ratcliffe says past decade reports failed to meet agency’s standards of impartiality
ISTANBUL
The US Central Intelligence Agency said Friday that Director John Ratcliffe has ordered the retraction or “substantive revision” of 19 intelligence assessments issued over the past decade after they were found to be politically biased.
In a statement, Ratcliffe said the intelligence products, produced before his tenure as director, “fall short of the high standards of impartiality that CIA must uphold” and do not reflect the agency’s analytic expertise, adding that there is “no room for bias” in the agency’s work.
The CIA said the assessments were identified by the US President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, following an independent review of hundreds of intelligence reports from the last decade.
According to the agency, the flagged products “did not meet CIA and IC (intelligence community) analytic tradecraft standards and failed to be independent of political consideration.”
The CIA released three redacted examples, including reports on women involved in racially motivated violent extremism, pressure on LGBT activists in the Middle East and North Africa, and COVID-19-related contraceptive shortages in developing countries.
According to The New York Times, citing a senior administration official, most of the other flagged reports concerned diversity, equity, and inclusion. Former officials questioned the decision to declassify the documents and the claim that the assessments were flawed, the newspaper reported.

The attack was carried out for no reason whatsoever!
We must state clearly: attacking military personnel is dangerous and irresponsible. These are trained, experienced assault fighters who have the full legal right to defend themselves in the event of a threat."

Students held protests at several Iranian universities at the start of a new semester on Saturday, some clashing with pro-government groups, according to local news agencies and posts on social media.
The protests coincided with ceremonies traditionally held after 40 days to mourn those killed by security forces during last month's anti-government demonstrations, which saw thousands lose their lives in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A video purportedly showed rows of marchers at Tehran's Sharif University of Technology condemning Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a "murderous leader", and calling for Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, to be a new monarch.
State-affiliated news agencies such as SNN carried videos of clashes, with protesters allegedly injuring volunteer student Basij militia by throwing rocks at Iran's top engineering university. Pro-government Basij members often assist security forces in quelling protests.
Protests were also held in Beheshti and Amir Kabir universities in the capital Tehran and Mashhad University in the northeast, according to videos published by rights group HAALVSH, which Reuters could not verify.
In the western town of Abdanan, a hotspot for protests, demonstrators chanted "Death to Khamenei" and "Death to the dictator" after the arrest of an activist teacher, according to rights group Hengaw and social media posts.

Giant tortoises make a comeback on Galapagos island
More than 150 giant tortoises have been reintroduced to Floreana Island in Ecuador's famed Galapagos archipelago where they disappeared more than a century ago, the environment ministry said Friday. Floreana was once home to some 20,000 giant tortoises, but whaling, a devastating fire, and relentless human exploitation led to their complete extinction on the island.
Nearly 150 years after the last giant tortoises were removed from Floreana Island in Ecuador’s Galápagos archipelago, the species made a comeback Friday, when dozens of juvenile hybrids were released to begin restoring the island’s depleted ecosystem.
The 158 newcomers, aged 8 to 13, have begun exploring the habitat they are destined to reshape over the coming years. Their release was perfectly timed with the arrival of the season’s first winter rains.
“They are large enough to be released and can defend themselves against introduced animals such as rats and cats,” said Fredy Villalba, director of the Galapagos National Park breeding centre on Santa Cruz Island, noting that the best specimens with the strongest lineage were selected specifically for Floreana.
These released juvenile specimens, out of a total of 700 planned for Floreana, will be introduced gradually. According to Christian Sevilla, director of ecosystems of the Galapagos National Park, they carry between 40% and 80% of the genetic makeup of the Chelonoidis niger – a species that has been extinct for 150 years.

The lineage of these hybrids traces back to Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island, a discovery that still puzzles scientists today. By selecting adults with the strongest genetic makeup, said Sevilla, the breeding program aims to gradually bring the extinct Floreana species back to its former purity.
Two centuries ago, Floreana was home to approximately 20,000 giant tortoises. However, whaling, a devastating fire, and relentless human exploitation eventually led to their complete extinction on the island.
“In genetic terms, reintroducing a species to that island with a significant genetic component of the original species is vital,” biologist Washington Tapia told The Associated Press.
Tapia, a researcher and director of Biodiversa-Consultores – a firm specializing in the Galápagos Islands — emphasized that this process is about more than just numbers; it is about restoring a lost lineage.
Flamingos, iguanas, penguins...
Floreana, an island spanning approximately 173 square kilometres (67 square miles), is a volcanic landmass and the southernmost point of the Galapagos archipelago. Situated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean — roughly 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) from the mainland coast — it remains a remote and vital ecological site.
The tortoises reintroduced to Floreana will share their territory with a diverse population of nearly 200 people alongside flamingos, iguanas, penguins, sea gulls and hawks. However, they must also contend with introduced plant species such as blackberry and guava, as well as animals like rats, cats, pigs and donkeys. These non-native species, introduced by human activity, represent potential threats to the island’s newest inhabitants.
Floreana resident Veronica Mora described the release of the turtles as a dream come true. “We are seeing the reality of a project that began several years ago,” she said, adding that the community feels immense pride in the return of the giant tortoises.

Macron urges calm after far-right activist killing shakes France

French President Emmanuel Macron appealed on Saturday for cooler heads to prevail ahead of a rally for a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge.
Macron also said his government would hold a meeting to discuss "violent action groups" in the wake of the fatal beating of Quentin Deranque, which has ignited tensions between the left and right ahead of the 2027 presidential vote.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in the southeastern city of Lyon last week.
Speaking at a farming trade fair in Paris, Macron urged "everyone to remain" calm ahead of the rally for Deranque in Lyon, which is set to go ahead under high security later on Saturday despite Lyon's left-wing green mayor asking the state to ban it.
The rally is expected to be attended by 2,000 to 3,000 people, and likely to see counter-protesters from the hard left.
"In the Republic, no violence is legitimate," said Macron, who will be unable to contest next year's election after hitting the two-term limit.
"There is no place for militias, no matter where they come from."
'Wound'
Having urged both the far right and hard left to clean up their acts, the president said his administration would hold a meeting next week "take stock of violent action groups which are active and have links with political parties of any description".
Deranque's death has provoked a reaction from US President Donald Trump's administration, with State Department official Sarah Rogers on Friday branding the killing "terrorism" and claiming that "violent radical leftism is on the rise".
Likewise, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday called Deranque's death "a wound for all Europe", prompting Macron to urge the far-right leader to stay out of French matters.
Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to a radical left-wing MP has also been charged with complicity.
A far-right collective called Nemesis, which claims to "defend Western women" from the violence allegedly wrought by immigrants, said Deranque had been at the protest in Lyon to protect its members when he was assaulted by "anti-fascist" activists.

World reacts as US top court limits Trump’s tariff powers
Some countries welcome the ruling, while others review trade deals and economic effect.
President Donald Trump has said he will raise global tariffs on imported goods to 15 percent after the United States Supreme Court struck down his previous trade measures.
The president announced his decision on Saturday, revising an earlier decision to impose a new 10 percent worldwide tariff after the Supreme Court ruling, which triggered immediate concern and responses from governments and markets.

The US top court’s ruling and Trump’s new tariffs have left countries grappling with the legal and economic fallout, raising questions about ongoing agreements, tariff reductions, and the legality of past duties.
Governments are now evaluating how the new levy will affect key industries, investment plans, and trade negotiations, while analysts warn that uncertainty could persist until legal and trade frameworks are clarified.
South Korea
In South Korea, one of the US’s closest allies, the presidential office, Blue House, has released a statement, saying the government will review the trade deal and make decisions in the national interest, casting a question mark over the agreement signed in November last year, which lowered tariffs from 25 to 15 percent in exchange for $350bn in cash and investments from South Korea in the US.
“For major South Korean companies in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, the Supreme Court ruling has been positive: Even if Trump introduces the new 10 percent tariffs under Section 122, they would still pay a lower rate,” said Jack Barton, an Al Jazeera correspondent in Seoul.
“However, exporters of automobiles, more than half of which go to the US, remain subject to the 25 percent tariff, and steel exports are still hit with 50 percent duties under Section 232, which was not affected by the ruling.”
The South Korean government is expected to move cautiously. Exports account for 85 percent of South Korea’s gross domestic product, with the US as the second-largest market.
“Officials have indicated that rapid changes could jeopardise major agreements, including a recent multibillion-dollar shipbuilding deal with the US and other investments,” said Barton.
“While no definitive policy statement has been made yet, the Blue House has said that the trade deal will be under careful review and changes are likely.”
India
India has faced some of the highest US tariffs under Trump’s previous use of emergency trade powers. The president first imposed a 25 percent levy on Indian imports and later added another 25 percent on the country’s purchases of Russian oil, bringing the total to 50 percent.
Earlier this month, the US and India reached a framework trade deal. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to stop buying Russian oil and that US tariffs would be lowered to 18 percent for India’s top exports to the US, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, precious stones, and textiles. Meanwhile, India said it will eliminate or reduce tariffs on all US industrial goods and a range of agricultural products.
According to political economist MK Venu, founding editor of Indian publication, The Wire, “Critics have argued New Delhi should have waited for the US Supreme Court decision before finalising the interim trade deal and even trade analysts previously connected with the government have maintained it would have been wiser to wait for the court verdict.”
Venu added that Trump was eager to finalise the trade deal, which includes a commitment to buy $500bn worth of new imports in defence, energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) from the US over the next five years.
While India, he said, welcomed the reduction of tariffs to 18 percent and the removal of penal duties on Russian imports, uncertainty remains over negotiations, as the Supreme Court ruling affects the legal basis of past tariffs.
“The Indian trade delegation is likely to wait for the final outcome of the Supreme Court verdict before proceeding with further negotiations, and countries around the world are expected to follow the court’s ruling rather than rush into trade agreements under legislation deemed unconstitutional,” he said.
China
China has reacted in a muted way to the Supreme Court ruling, with much of the country still on the Lunar New Year break.
Al Jazeera’s Rob McBride, reporting from Beijing, said, “The Chinese embassy in Washington has issued a blanket statement, noting that trade wars benefit nobody, and that the decision is likely to be broadly welcomed in China, which has long been a primary target of Trump’s tariff policies.”
Since last April, he said, China has faced multiple layers of tariffs, including 10 percent on chemicals used in fentanyl production exported to the US and 100 percent on electric vehicles.
Analysts have estimated that the overall tariff level, about 36 percent, could now fall to about 21 percent, providing some relief to an economy already under strain from the COVID-19 pandemic, a prolonged property market crisis, and declining exports.
Shipments from China to the US have reportedly fallen by roughly a fifth over the past year.
“Beijing has sought to offset losses in the US market by strengthening trade ties with Southeast Asian nations and pursuing agreements with the European Union,” McBride said.
“The Supreme Court ruling may also create a more favourable atmosphere ahead of a planned state visit by Trump in early April, when he is expected to meet President Xi Jinping, potentially opening space for a reset in relations between the world’s two largest economies.”
Canada
Canada has welcomed the US Supreme Court’s decision but has pointed out that there are still some challenges ahead.
Regional leaders across the country, including those of British Columbia and Ontario, have signalled that the ruling is a positive step, according to Al Jazeera’s Ian Wood, reporting from Toronto.
However, Minister for Canada-US trade Dominic LeBlanc has said that significant work remains, as Section 232 tariffs on steel, aluminium, softwood lumber, and automobiles have remained in place.
Meanwhile, Ontario’s Premier Doug Ford has added that while optimism has grown, tension has persisted over what Donald Trump will do next, Wood said.
Mexico
Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, said her government would be carefully reviewing the Supreme Court’s decision to assess its scope and the extent to which Mexico might be affected.
“The reality is that despite all we’ve heard over the last year about tariffs or the threat of tariffs, Mexico has actually ended up in quite a privileged, even competitive position, especially when compared to other countries,” said Al Jazeera’s Julia Gliano, reporting from Mexico City.
“We have to remember Mexico is the US’s largest trading partner, and the two countries, along with Canada, share a vast trading agreement that shields most products from the so-called reciprocal tariffs that President Trump announced.
“There were also punitive tariffs related to fentanyl and illegal immigration along the US border, which Mexico had managed to suspend while negotiations continued on those matters. Now the tariffs that Mexico has been subjected to on steel, aluminium, and car parts are not affected by today’s decision.”
So, the government here in Mexico, she said, is now standing by to see what the Trump administration comes up with next as it reels from today’s decision by the Supreme Court.
France
French President Emmanuel Macron hailed “the existence of checks and balances in democracies” after the Supreme Court’s decision, telling reporters at an event in the capital that his country wanted to continue exporting “under the fairest rules possible and not be subject to unilateral decisions”.
The country’s finance minister, Nicolas Forissier, told UK newspaper The Financial Times that the EU has the tools to hit back at the US over its tariff policy, suggesting a more combative approach.
Germany
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he expected the tariff burden on his country’s economy to be lower after the US Supreme Court ruling, raising the prospect of German companies recouping billions in refunds.
Flagging an upcoming visit to Washington, Merz told Germany’s ARD broadcaster that he would present a “coordinated European position” on the matter, pointing out that tariff policy is determined by the European Union rather than individual member states.
Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said Europe was strengthening its independence and sovereignty, building new trade relationships worldwide and concluding free trade agreements.
Limits of Trump’s tariff powers
A senior legal scholar told Al Jazeera that the US Supreme Court ruling marks a key moment in the legal battle over Trump’s tariffs, focusing on constitutional limits rather than economics.
Frank Bowman, professor emeritus at the University of Missouri School of Law, told Al Jazeera that the court has for the first time confronted what he called Trump’s broader challenge to the rule of law.
“This is a ruling that is important in several respects. The first, more broadly, is that this is the first time in the last year that the Supreme Court has stepped in and attempted to do something about Donald Trump’s generalised attack on the rule of law in the United States.
“And make no mistake, although tariffs certainly are about economics, what Trump has done over the last year is essentially to defy the law. And the Supreme Court happily decided that they had had enough and that they would say no. So, they’re not ruling on economic policy. They made a decision that the president simply exceeded his constitutional authority.”

John Swinney has visited Babcock’s Rosyth yard to see first hand how work on the Royal Navy’s Type 31 frigates is progressing and to underline the importance of naval shipbuilding to Scotland’s economy.
During the visit, the First Minister toured the Venturer Building, where five Inspiration-class frigates are taking shape for the Royal Navy. The programme is one of the centrepieces of the UK’s National Shipbuilding Strategy and is intended to replace the ageing Type 23 general purpose fleet while sustaining a steady drumbeat of warship construction.
Babcock says it supports more than 10,500 jobs across the UK and contributes over £500 million annually to Scotland’s GDP. At Rosyth, the Type 31 programme has driven investment in modernised facilities and advanced manufacturing processes, alongside apprenticeships and specialist engineering roles that feed into the wider defence supply chain.
Rosyth’s work on Type 31 sits alongside construction of the Type 26 anti-submarine frigates on the Clyde, together anchoring Scotland’s role in delivering the future surface fleet.
For Rosyth, the visit was an opportunity to showcase both the scale of the build programme and the long term industrial capability being developed on the Forth, positioning the yard as a key player in UK and NATO maritime manufacturing for decades to come.

Zelensky Says Ukraine ‘Not Losing’ War As WSJ Correspondent Reports Three-Year Planning Directive

President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted Friday that Ukraine is “definitely not losing” its war against Russia, while a Wall Street Journal correspondent recounted in a podcast interview that the Ukrainian leader had privately told his closest advisers to prepare for another three years of fighting.
Taken together, Zelensky’s public remarks and the journalist’s account of closed-door discussions suggest that Kyiv is preparing for a prolonged conflict, with negotiations still stalled over territory and security guarantees nearly four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion began.

“We’re definitely not losing it”
In an interview with AFP, Zelensky rejected suggestions that Ukraine is on the brink of defeat.
“You can’t say that we’re losing the war. Honestly, we’re definitely not losing it, definitely. The question is whether we will win,” he said. “That is the question – but it’s a very costly question.”
The 48-year-old president acknowledged the mounting strain of Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, as Russia intensifies strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure during a punishing winter.
He also described the diplomatic pressure surrounding the Donbas, the eastern region comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.
“Both the Americans and the Russians say that if you want the war to end tomorrow, get out of Donbas,” Zelensky said.
Algorithms of War are Shifting
At the same time, he pointed to battlefield resilience. “Today I can congratulate our army first and foremost – all the defense forces – because as of today, 300 square kilometres have been liberated,” he said of gains along the southern front. AFP noted it was unable to independently verify the claim.
On security guarantees, Zelensky reiterated that any post-ceasefire European troop deployment should be positioned close to the front line. “We would like to see the contingent closer to the front line,” he said, adding that Ukrainians would want partners “to stand with us on the front line.”
Zelensky, who was elected in 2019 and whose five-year term formally expired in May 2024, dismissed calls for wartime elections. “Let’s be honest – the Russians just want to replace me,” Zelensky said. “No one wants elections during a war. Everyone is afraid of its destructive effect.”
“The negotiations have basically failed”
While Zelensky projected determination publicly, Bojan Pancevski, chief European political correspondent of The Wall Street Journal, described a far bleaker message delivered behind closed doors.
Speaking on a German podcast hosted by journalist Paul Ronzheimer, Pancevski said Zelensky convened his “private cabinet” – his closest advisers inside the Presidential Office – a day before departing for the Munich Security Conference last week.
“At this meeting he told his closest people that the negotiations had basically failed and that they now need to work out a plan for another three years of war,” Pancevski said. “He said that explicitly.”
Citing three sources from Zelensky’s inner circle, Pancevski noted those present were “totally shocked,” adding that “no one wants three more years of war.”
Until that moment, he said, the team had been preparing for a different trajectory: organizing elections and potentially a referendum in late spring or early summer to present any negotiated settlement to voters.
“Now suddenly Zelensky turns 180 degrees internally and says: this is all nonsense and we have to prepare for a long war,” Pancevski said.
Guarantees, Congress and mistrust
Pancevski said Zelensky had indicated he might consider territorial compromise only if backed by strong, legally binding security guarantees – particularly from the United States.
He described US assurances so far as largely verbal. “He wants guarantees that pass through Congress,” Pancevski said, arguing that Zelensky seeks commitments with the force of law rather than political promises.
Inside Western coordination, Pancevski described what he called an unusual structure in which Washington was treated as a separate actor rather than folded into NATO alongside its European allies.
“In these tables, there were three columns: USA, NATO and Ukraine,” he said, adding that at least at one stage, American contributions had not been formally written down, only conveyed verbally.
From Moscow’s side, Pancevski said Russian officials have signaled they would reject any agreement permitting Western or NATO troops to be stationed on Ukrainian soil.
Pressure from Washington
Zelensky has publicly pushed back against what he sees as uneven pressure.
In remarks to Axios previously reported by Kyiv Post, he described it as “not fair” that US President Donald Trump had publicly urged Ukraine, rather than Russia, to make concessions. While acknowledging Trump’s peacemaking efforts, Zelensky warned against presenting Ukrainians with what they would view as an “unsuccessful story” of peace and stressed that lasting stability cannot be achieved by “giving victory” to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Pancevski also pointed to domestic US politics as a factor shaping the White House’s approach. He speculated that legally binding guarantees could expose Trump to criticism ahead of midterm elections, particularly given the president’s campaign pledges to avoid new foreign entanglements.
At the same time, he argued that US sanctions remain potent. Even a social media post threatening measures against major Russian energy firms such as Rosneft and Lukoil, he said, prompted immediate reactions from international companies seeking to avoid secondary sanctions.
Divisions in Kyiv
Pancevski also described what he said were internal divisions within Ukraine’s political leadership over how to approach the negotiations. According to him, one camp – associated with Kyrylo Budanov, the former intelligence chief now serving in a senior role within the Presidential Office – has been viewed as more open to exploring a deal under certain conditions. Another grouping, linked to Andriy Yermak, Zelensky’s former chief of staff, has been characterized as more skeptical of the current diplomatic track.
Although Yermak was formally dismissed, Pancevski said he remains influential within Zelensky’s inner circle and continues to shape discussions from behind the scenes. He added that several European officials had privately expressed relief at Yermak’s removal, describing him as a difficult interlocutor during earlier phases of the talks.
The internal dynamic, as Pancevski portrayed it, reflects broader uncertainty in Kyiv about whether the current negotiations offer a viable path to peace – or risk locking Ukraine into concessions without durable security guarantees.
A war of attrition
Militarily, Pancevski portrayed the front line as largely static despite heavy casualties on both sides. Russian forces, he said, have mobilized manpower and equipment but have struggled to achieve decisive breakthroughs.
The greater danger, in his view, lies in the escalating air war. Russia has ramped up production of ballistic missiles and drones, and Ukraine’s ability to intercept them depends heavily on systems such as the US-made Patriot – interceptors that remain in limited supply.
Whether Zelensky has indeed instructed his team to plan for a prolonged war remains unconfirmed publicly. With both sides, Kyiv and Moscow holding firm on core demands, the prospect of a swift diplomatic breakthrough appears increasingly distant.

Woman charged after dog allegedly abandoned at Las Vegas airport; adoption applications pour in

Not everything that happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, especially when it involves a confused goldendoodle abandoned at an airport.
A 26-year-old woman has been charged after she allegedly left her two-year-old dog at Las Vegas’ Harry Reid International Airport on Feb 2.
Police officers found the animal tied to a baggage sizer near a ticket counter after being alerted by other travellers, said the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department in a Facebook post on Feb 19.
The woman, identified by USA Today as Germiran Bryson, had been denied a boarding pass after failing to complete online documentation to travel with the dog as a service animal.
In a video released by Las Vegas police, she is seen speaking with airport staff at the ticket counter while holding onto her luggage and the dog on a leash.
When she was told that she had not submitted the paperwork, she was refused boarding.
The authorities alleged she then left the dog behind and proceeded through the airport to her departure gate.
CCTV footage shows her walking away from the ticket counter with only her luggage. Moments later, airport employees are seen approaching the dog as it starts wagging its tail.
When officers found her at the boarding gate and asked why she had abandoned the dog, she stated that the airline would not allow her to fly with it.
She also claimed that she went to the gate to “rebook my flight”, according to bodycam footage released by the police.
“(She) claimed the dog had a tracking device, implying it was acceptable to leave the animal behind, and it would return to her,’ the police added in a Facebook post.
The police said that she became “hostile and resisted officers’ attempts to detain her” as they escorted her back through the security checkpoint.
Court records show she faces misdemeanor counts of animal abandonment, resisting a public officer, providing false statements to obstruct a public officer and animal abuse, reported USA Today.
“We can’t believe we have to say this... but please don’t abandon your dog at the airport - or anywhere else,” the police said in the Facebook post.
The dog was placed in Animal Protective Services for 10 days to allow its owner to come back for it.
But after Bryson failed to return, charity Retriever Rescue of Las Vegas took the dog in and renamed him Jet Blue, after the airline ticket counter where he was found.
Jet Blue’s story quickly gained attention online, drawing hundreds of adoption applications and inquiries.
Founder Danielle Roth told USA Today on Feb 20 that it has received over 300 applications.
She said Jet Blue knew that he was out of danger when he was picked up by the charity.
“He licked our faces, wagged his tail and jumped up on us,” Ms Roth said. “There was no stress, like he knew he was safe. Like he knew he was never going to be stressed again.”
The rescue said a formal application process is required, as Jet Blue deserves “stability, security, commitment and a lifetime promise”.
“This sweet boy is incredible. Truly incredible. And after everything he’s been through, the thought of him ever experiencing abandonment again has us on very high alert. We will be extremely intentional in choosing his forever family,” the charity wrote on Facebook on Feb 19.
The group added that Jet Blue’s case has helped raise awareness about rescue efforts, abandonment laws and the reality that dogs are not disposable.
The charity wrote: “He isn’t just a headline. He isn’t just a cute face. He is a living, breathing soul who needs his needs met for the rest of his life.”

Hazardous driving throughout Finland during busy travel weekend
Finland
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-21
11:32:10 EET
18:32:10 KST

The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) warns of poor driving conditions on Saturday throughout the country, from the Åland Islands to northernmost Lapland. On Sunday, hazardous conditions continue in most southern, central and eastern areas.
The alert comes on a busy travel weekend, with many families driving to or from ski resorts or cabins.
On Monday, school holidays end in most of southern Finland and begin in central and western areas. The staggered winter break schedule continues with schools in eastern and northern Finland closed during the first week of March.
"Bad road conditions are expected because of snow, blowing snow and rising temperatures," the FMI says, pointing to a greater risk of accidents through the weekend.
According to Yle meteorologist Anne Borgström, snowfall will increase from the west on Saturday, mixed with freezing drizzle in some areas. In the evening and overnight, snowfall will become heavy in southern parts of the country.
On Sunday, the band of snow will move eastward, with 5-10 cm expected in eastern areas. The weather will clear up in the rest of the country, with temperatures remaining below freezing – as they have been in most of the country since the beginning of the year.
On Saturday afternoon, though, the temperature could rise to +2 degrees Celsius in the southwestern Finland and Åland, according to Foreca meteorologist Anna Latvala.
Generally, temperatures in the south and west will be between zero and –4, and elsewhere between -2 and -10, remaining colder than -20 in clear areas of Northern Lapland.
20cm of new snow possible
Latvala predicts that nearly all parts of the country will get new snow on Saturday, with accumulations of 2–10 centimetres. Some southern and eastern areas could receive a further 2–10 centimetres on Sunday morning before the precipitation moves off to the east.
After weeks of very light winds, southern and central parts of the country will experience moderate winds from the southwest. That wind may stir up snow, hampering visibility.
Overnight lows range between -2 in the south and east to -30 in parts of central and northern Lapland.
Sunday night will be blustery and cold, dropping to between -10 and -20 degrees in southern and central parts of the country and to around -30 locally in Lapland.
The forecast for next week is still variable, but it looks like another high pressure system will strengthen over Finland, according to Latvala. That would mean only light local snow and partly sunny skies, with temperatures remaining below the freezing point as February draws to a close.
Classes resume on Monday in capital region, Turku and Pori
Pupils in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, as well as those in Pori and Turku, are generally due back at their desks on 23 February.
During week 9 (23–27 February), schools in Hämeenlinna, Kotka, Mikkeli, Tampere and other south-central municipalities are on vacation.
Youngsters in northern and eastern cities and municipalities such as Oulu, Rovaniemi and Kuopio are on holiday during week 10 (2–6 March).
The next school holidays are around Easter, which falls on 3–6 April this year.

5 European nations to make drones by tapping Ukraine’s war experience
The initiative by France, Poland, Germany, the UK and Italy comes after a spate of violations of Europe’s airspace involving rogue drones
Both Moscow and Kyiv have cutting-edge drone warfare capabilities forged in the grim laboratory of war where battlefield innovations have rewritten modern battle tactics. Poland is already working with Ukraine on drone technology in joint military training programmes and manufacturing projects.
Those efforts were sparked by a spate of incidents in which Europe’s borders and airports have been tested by rogue drones. Russia has been blamed for some of them but denies that anything was done on purpose or that it played a role.
“We have some of the best kit on the entire planet for shooting down air threats. The problem is to be effective at shooting down relatively low-cost missiles, drones and other threats facing us,” he said. “We need to make sure that we’re matching the cost of the threats with the cost of defence.”

Swiss filmmaking duo follow Kurt Cobain’s afterlife to cheers in Rotterdam
With First Days, Kim Allamand and Michael Karrer achieved the rare goal of creating a highly conceptual experimental film that also seduces a general audience. They spoke to Swissinfo right after the premiere at Rotterdam Film Festival.
At the end of Gus Van Sant’s Last Days (2005), the Kurt Cobain look-alike character leaves this mortal coil. After a self-inflicted death, the spirit of the legendary rock star seems to escape his body, drifting away into a dimension the camera can’t capture anymore.
This haunting depiction of the grunge icon venturing into the beyond inspired Swiss filmmakers Kim Allamand and Michael Karrer to team up and co-direct their experimental feature film First Days, which is coming hot off the heels of a successful world premiere at International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR).
“We thought the ending of Last Days could be a good departure point for ours,” Allamand, joined by Karrer over Zoom, recalls as IFFR draws to an end. “We wanted to show the first days of spirits in the netherworld, so recalling Van Sant made sense for the premise of our movie. While watching his film, we were left wondering: where is this spirit going?”
Metamorphosis
But before Nirvana diehards rush out in droves to see their favourite rock star on the big screen again, it should be stressed that they won’t find any physical likeness to Kurt Cobain in First Days at all. Instead, they will encounter two spirits — women of colour played by dancers and movement artists Nasheeka Nedsreal and Jia-Yu Corti — who wordlessly navigate a remote manor and its lush, green surroundings.
Within the metaphysical universe of the film, this inexplicable metamorphosis makes total sense, as the aim of this artistic duo was to depict life after death as a transitory space, where our rules of existence don’t apply anymore. The gentle imagery and layered sounds of First Days make it feel like the viewer is taking in an abstract audiovisual poem, one that doesn’t contain any spoken dialogue.
Unlike a lot of experimental cinema made in a similar vein, First Days deserves praise for never punishing its audience with impenetrable levels of abstraction. It attentively captures tiny movements in faces, bodies, places and spaces with a zen-like, almost Taoist gaze.
“This was actually the main tension we carried in ourselves throughout the entire process of making this film,” Karrer admits when asked about finding a middle ground between experimentation and accessibility. “We like the idea of pushing the boundaries in an audiovisual sense as far as possible, while simultaneously always keeping in mind that we want to invite every member of the audience to be part of this journey.”
Allamand says that, up to the very last moments of the IFFR premiere they weren’t quite sure if they had succeeded in making a film that was both experimental and that would resonate with a broader audience.
“The screening of the film was the moment for us to find out if our ideas worked and our doubts were unjustified. Luckily, the premiere was fantastic. We received a lot of warm and emotional feedback. A filmmaker who also had a film playing at the festival actually said that he was still crying about First Days while he was already in a screening room watching the next film on his schedule! We could have never dreamed of somebody coming up to us like this.”
Bonds of cinephilia
Fittingly, this creative collaboration between Allamand and Karrer all started with a shared dream. The duo first met over a decade ago when they were doing their bachelor and masters degrees at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK). They bonded over gems of world cinema and rinsed through the filmographies of global auteurs like Apichatpong Weerasethakul and the late Béla Tarr — initiated cinephiles will surely spot First Days’ cheeky reference to The Turin Horse (2011) in the form of a piping hot potato.
Both Allamand and Karrer emerged as rising directors in their own right before they hatched a plan to “find a combined vision” says Karrer, “based off of all the films we watched and talked about amongst the two of us.”
Allamand adds that the initial conceit of First Days was “to make a film together, and to do it quickly. To not wait for funding, to never be bogged down, and just take a tiny crew, jump on a set and shoot a movie.” Ironically, money did unexpectedly come through via the Fast Track Competition launched by the Zurich Film Fund, which supports emerging talents who aspire to films with high artistic merit.
The technical side of spirits
In a gorgeous, somewhat dilapidated-looking house in the remote countryside of France, they found the physical location that would symbolise the spirit realm of First Days. During the twenty or so shooting days, the directors also stayed in the manor, alongside their modest crew and two actresses.
“It was kind of a shock,” Allamand recalls about suddenly standing on set, having to glean as much usable material for the editing process that would soon follow. “All these conceptual notions about spirits and afterlife suddenly turned very technical and practical. It meant we had to remind ourselves to keep looking deeper and find the right imagery that could transport actual deeper feelings and emotions.”
Lead actresses Nedsreal and Corti didn’t have a background in traditional film or theatre acting, meaning they were even better equipped for the conceptual and non-verbal approach Allamand and Karrer had in mind. “It was incredibly fun for us to watch them work with tiny gestures that conveyed much deeper ideas,” Allamand emphasises.
“For us it was a kind of beautiful mystery, because we don’t even know how they prepare or what they are doing.” Karrer adds that “in hindsight, we were surprised how fast they adapted to our process and had trust in our vision. It was a big gift for us.”
Journey into another dimension
Speaking of gifts: the only actual language used in the film is a mysterious opening title that feels like a present to the viewer. It goes:
An ancient tale said: In the first days after death you must enter a house where no words remain. Awaited by a soul and guided to a whole, you wander into the light only to be left behind. Thus the house is never empty and the waiting never ends.
When asked where this intriguing quote actually comes from, Karrer and Allamand slyly suggest that it simply came to them. “We’re pretty sure it existed before us,” they say, speaking almost in riddles. Maybe that’s also what makes this such a distinctive film within Swiss cinema, “as our culture is not one of ancient tales about death or the afterlife,” Allamand agrees.
Using just images, they have managed to convey what spoken words — or simply put, human language — could not. While highly specific, First Days is a universal tale of time, space, movement and loss. On a meta level, it’s a pure reflection on the power of cinema itself, which Karrer and Allamand feel very strongly about. “We always said this to each other,” concludes Karrer, “that cinema itself is a small journey into another dimension.”

How to open yourself to feedback and personal growth

Remember back to COVID days? I would never have anticipated that the world would endure such a difficult pandemic. Yet in many ways, it now feels as if it were long ago. At the time, my beloved husband/editor said as I was about to work on a column, “You’re going to write about COVID again? How much can you write about it?”
After that we had an 843-day war, and with all that we went through, we are still very much on edge, not knowing what tomorrow will bring. During the war, my beloved husband/editor said, “You’re going to write about the war again? How much can you write about the war?”
I responded, “Well, it’s still going on, so that’s what my readers are thinking about. Each week brings about different issues for them, and each needs to be addressed.”
So, he looked me in the eye and said, “Maybe it’s time to write about something else.” I said, “Okay, what should I write about?” He not so helpfully said, “I don’t know, maybe pick something benign like enuresis.” “Enuresis – bed wetting! Are you serious? Someone could simply Google that,” I responded.
Then along came AI. I am the most technically challenged person on Earth, but a friend installed ChatGPT on my cellphone. Once or twice, when I’ve asked certain questions, I found myself politely thanking AI for “her” thoughtful response.
It is all a bit – if not a lot– scary, but I’ll save that for another time. AI, along with Google and Siri, have kindly enabled me to not write about enuresis because my readers could easily access this information.
I want my columns to address a different aspect of psychology. After 26 years of writing for The Jerusalem Post, I believe the articles should reflect something deeper than simply presenting facts.
As such, my most recent columns, which openly explored aspects of my husband’s sudden death and my grandson’s brain tumor – and even the two columns I wrote back in 2014 about my own cancer – are not topics most people are comfortable chatting about.
What has been my impetus for continuing this column, as we move forward, is the hope that I can help provide some strategies for coping with whatever life throws at us. Readers, your recent feedback has been incredible and makes me feel that I am on the right track. I always welcome your thoughts.
You're right, I'm wrong
Recently, on a busy Friday afternoon, I dropped off an important envelope with a friend who was flying abroad. Using a walker, she met me at the front door of her apartment building and invited me to sit in the lobby with her for a few minutes.
With no place to park in the immediate area, she suggested that I park directly in front of her building. When I stated that it looked like someone’s parking spot, she said she had never seen anyone park there and we’d literally sit for a few minutes.
Wrong on both accounts. We started chatting, and time flew by. When I left, I discovered that my car was blocked by the owner of the spot I was parked in. As I was debating what to do with Shabbat quickly approaching, an angry man suddenly appeared, rebuking me and shouting that he had considered keeping his car blocking mine until Shabbat ended.
Yelling at me that I had no right to take his spot, he seemed surprised when I looked him in the eye and said, “Yes, you are absolutely right. What I did was wrong.” He continued his rant for several minutes, and I calmly said again that he was indeed correct and that I should not have taken his spot, and that what I did was wrong.
Coming physically closer to me, he realized that I was religious and said that what I did was a hillul Hashem, “a desecration of God’s name.” In other words, he was suggesting that what I did was even worse because I was religious. Again, I said to him that of course he was right and that I should not have parked in his spot.
My friend, who had been listening in silence and in shock until then, began to explain that she was taking an important envelope back to Canada because my husband had recently died. At that point, the man looked to me for confirmation and, upon receiving it, said he was sorry.
I wasn’t sure just what he was sorry for – my loss or that he had yelled at me – but the conversation ended, and with the clock ticking away, I wished him Shabbat shalom and drove home. While my friend was upset at this man’s behavior, again I said to her that I should not have taken a spot that was not mine to take.
What if everybody did that?
When I first began to cover my head, my daughter said to me, “Ima [Mom], if you wear a hat, you cannot just ‘be’ religious, but you must also ‘act’ religious. People will have higher expectations for your behavior, and you will now be representing all who are religious. You must always think before you speak or act because you will be judged.”
My daughter was right with respect to my parking, and this was a perfect example. It shouldn’t matter if we are religious or not: We all must be held accountable for our actions. I have referred in the past to a book our children loved when they were younger, What If Everybody Did That? (Ellen Javernick, 1990), which talks about throwing garbage out the window, splashing in the pool, feeding animals at the zoo, and more.
We each have to work on ourselves every day. Our actions have an impact on those around us. I was reminded once again that I have no right to park in someone else’s spot, even for just five minutes. I apologized so quickly because I had been in this man’s situation, which, of course, made it all much worse.
We used to live next door to a famous young Israeli movie star/singer, and her father constantly blocked my driveway. When I got angry with his behavior and confronted him, he looked me in the eye and said, “Just come knock on my door, and I’ll move my car.” I was in shock.
I told him I would not ring his doorbell to ask permission when I want to leave my house. Furthermore, I reminded him that I was on call with the Hatzalah emergency service, so if I had to leave, time was of the essence. When he continued to ignore me, I threatened to call the police. He finally heard me and stopped parking there.
Just let it flow
As a psychologist, I try to look at most situations with curiosity and ask what I can learn from these incidents. We may not want feedback from others – be it a driver, our family, or our friends – but when it is given appropriately, it is important for our personal growth.
We have an enormous capacity to enrich our lives when we can step back and appreciate the world around us. Sometimes we fail to hear or to listen, or we simply don’t see what is right in front of our eyes. We sadly remain untouched by the caring of others and all that we are blessed with, and we get caught up with and preoccupied by things that are truly unimportant.
The past several months have reminded me that once again, my life is not totally within my control (as much as I would like it to be) and that some days I need to take life one hour at a time because one day at a time may feel too long. And that, too, is a gift – if we can appreciate the small things and allow ourselves to just zorem, “to flow.”
I am very grateful as always to you, my readers, for your feedback – and I ask everyone to please include Yishai ben Shayna Miriam in your prayers. Together, we all can and will make a difference.■

Glow Glamping: Healing trauma and finding peace in the Galilee - review
Unknown

Recently, a friend stopped by to say hello. “How are you?” I asked, introducing her to two acquaintances sitting at my side. “Good!” she replied, with a happy smile. “Very good!”
And we all pounced. “Good?!?” we retorted, in indignant unison. “Good?!? How?”
My friend was mortified. “In the micro,” she elaborated. “In the macro I’m disintegrating, too.”
It was a sobering moment. Something is very rotten when you’re attacked for feeling okay.
Relentless public trauma is clobbering us all with overwhelming anxiety and despair. How refreshing it is, and how crucial, to take time off in a peaceful space and regroup. Glow Glamping on Rom Farm, 10 minutes from Karmiel in the Galilee, is restorative.
The magic begins before reaching the glamorous tents, before viewing the goats and their tiny kids, before oohing over the farm-to-table breakfast. The drive up Mount Kamon mellows the shakiest mood – the farm nestles far away from hooting horns and scooting around daily chores; the air is clear, and the living feels easy.
Nature walks, bonfires under starry skies, yummy local food, and a massage in a tent after a steaming sauna all recall memories of simpler days when we were young, and the world seemed sane.
But there is much, much more to the farm than a fun holiday in the sun. Started by Amit Rom almost 40 years ago, the land from the get-go was a vision realized.
“I grew up on a pig farm,” recalls Rom, “but that was not my dream. My mom was a Holocaust survivor and a social worker for all the Bedouin in the South; I wanted to work with the values she’d inculcated.”
The government desired a deer farm in the Galilee; Rom convinced it that goats were the way to go. In 1986, he off-loaded a herd of 50 onto the fertile terraces of his newly acquired land, unpacked a shipping container, which became his home, and started selling milk to Tnuva.
His entire herd was stolen once, then the replacements were stolen, too, but Rom and his growing family (he and his wife have three daughters and a son) simply started again.
Rom Farm: Sustainable dairy, crafts & wellness in Israel
Today, the thriving 2.6 hectares (6.5 acres) of built area and 140 hectares of pastures boast an internationally award-winning dairy; yoga, pottery, and carpentry workshops; a restaurant; crafts shop, and more. The spices, vegetables, and herbs are grown using sustainable methods of irrigation from compost created on-site.
But the enchantment does not stop there. Rom Farm is literally a healing space, where wounded souls can rest and mend.
Almost 20 years ago, Rom established a center for patients with mental challenges, tailoring treatment to individuals and teaching productive skills to enable them to work with dignity. Many ultimately find general employment; those who can’t remain to work on-site.
Ten years ago, the farm was functioning, the goats giving good yields, the 14 patients gainfully employed, and things were chugging along, when Ron Propper, one of the heirs to the Osem foods dynasty, “fell out of the sky and onto my property!” exclaims Rom.
Ron met Rom, and dreams ignited. Propper, a real estate tycoon, had been looking for a return-to-nature, sustainable tourism opportunity. He came in as a partner, and how goodly became thy tents, and thy tabernacles, O Israel.
Glow Glamping, with 19 luxury tents and one brick-and-mortar suite, is the perfect place for a wedding or to mellow with your kids. Prettily appointed spacious tents with en suite bathrooms, staff members who feel like friends, mountain views, and pin-drop quiet are reasons enough to head for the hills.
BUT THAT is only one aspect of the enterprise.
In addition to tourism, the farm is a safe haven for 150 trauma patients: soldiers with PTSD from the recent war; reservists in between call-ups; parents of children murdered at the Supernova music festival; siblings of fallen soldiers; and older soldiers who were not treated properly years ago.
“Post-trauma wounds your soul,” explains Albert Anconina, 57, a reservist who volunteered on Oct. 7 and spent 455 days in uniform over the past two years. The married father of three came home at last, got into bed, pulled a blanket over his head, and could not get up. Any little noise jolts a fractured mind back into battle: a plate breaking, a child crying, a door being slammed. Battlefield memories bring back the trauma – bombs exploding, friends being hit, yourself being hit.
Defense Ministry figures show that of the 22,000 wounded from the ongoing war, 58% are coping with psychological injury. Estimates expect an additional 10,000 among the wounded to join this sad statistic, most of them dealing with mental health challenges.
Racheli Stern, head of the Social Services Division for Post-Trauma at the Defense Ministry Rehabilitation Department, says the goal is to heal the deep fractures caused by psychological wounds and enable renewed growth and a good life alongside the wound and pain. The ministry understood the value of open spaces, connectivity to the land, nature, and animal-assisted therapy. Nine rehab farms were established for this purpose; Rom Farm is one.
“The cream of Israel comes to us,” says Edan Shir, CEO of the farm. “They are broken, can’t sleep, can’t function; every plane that flies over is a trigger. We are aware of this and pick our therapists with precision; we provide a safe space where healing can begin.”
Anconina agrees. “Religious soldiers like me weren’t sure if we could eat there,” he recalls. “Eating and cooking together is a big part of the process. We shared this with our mostly secular staff, who bent over backwards to ensure the highest level of kashrut. That’s symbolic of the enormous caring we have felt consistently.”
Secular, religious, Arabs, Jews – the whole mosaic of Israeli society is working and healing together in the secluded space. Morning meetings focus on patient well-being; the emphasis is not to dwell on terrible memories, which often are shared later, during daily activities.
Yoga, acupuncture, sound healing, pottery, carpentry, working in the forest and in the herb garden, simple mingling in the coffee shop. Step by step, the farm erases the survivor guilt that some of the wounded feel and “changes reality for us, by giving us back a future,” says Anconina.
There are challenges ahead. Although the Defense Ministry has expanded its medical and psychological support infrastructure by a 53% budget increase (to NIS 8.3 billion), wounded soldiers still face financial hurdles. Even if treatment is covered, many face loss of earnings and other war-related problems.
The country is not yet in healing mode itself; while we glamped and gramped (taking grandchildren on holiday), F-16 fighter jets streaked endlessly across the starry skies over the snuggly bonfire as we wondered whether US President Donald Trump or Iran would attack.
We will take it step by step. Propper’s social impact enterprise vision – successful, providing employment to every sector of society, boosting local agriculture and products, and, most importantly, healing the damaged – is a beautiful model for the country as a whole.
May we soon know less fraught and fractured times, when we never feel bad about feeling good.

US immigration agency arrests migrants convicted of sexual offenses, drug trafficking
US Homeland Security Department says nearly 70% of immigration enforcement arrests involve individuals convicted or charged with crimes
ISTANBUL
The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers have arrested several migrants with prior convictions for violent and sexual crimes, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Friday.
The arrests, carried out Thursday in multiple states, targeted individuals previously convicted of offenses, including sexual crimes against minors, drug trafficking, and aggravated assault, according to the DHS.
In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said ICE personnel continue enforcement operations despite a sharp rise in threats and assaults against officers.
“Nearly 70% of all ICE arrests are of illegal aliens convicted or charged with a crime in the US,” McLaughlin said. “If you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US.”
Among those arrested was Michelle Rodriguez-Berrio, a Colombian national convicted in Salt Lake City, Utah, of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, DHS said.
Rene Lopez-Balbuena, a Mexican national convicted in Monmouth County, New Jersey, of endangering the welfare of a child and sexually assaulting a child, was also taken into custody.
In Boone County, Missouri, ICE officers arrested Luis Elias-Santos, a Mexican national convicted of second-degree statutory rape.
Jeovanny Porras-Rodriguez, another Mexican national, was arrested following a conviction in Buncombe County, North Carolina, for trafficking methamphetamine, the department added.
Authorities also detained Leonardo Garcia-Meza, a Mexican national convicted in Collin County, Texas, of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.
The DHS said earlier this month that ICE officers are facing what it called a coordinated campaign of violence. The department reported that assaults against ICE personnel have increased by more than 1,300%, death threats by 8,000%, and vehicle attacks by 3,200%.

Tomb more than 1,000 years old found in Panama

PANAMA CITY - Archaeologists have discovered a tomb more than a thousand years old in Panama containing human remains alongside gold and ceramic artifacts, the lead researcher told AFP on Feb 20.
The discovery was made at the El Cano site in the Nata district about 200km southwest of Panama City.
Scientists and archaeologists have already unearthed other remains of pre-Hispanic cultures in the region that has been excavated for two decades.
The skeletal remains were found surrounded by gold objects and pottery decorated with traditional motifs, pointing to these being “high-ranking” individuals, archaeologist Julia Mayo told AFP, adding that the tomb was built between 800AD and 1000AD.
“The individual with the gold was the one with the highest social status in the group,” she said.
That body was found with two bracelets, two earrings, and pectoral jewelry that featured bats and crocodiles, she added.
The El Cano archaeological site is linked to the societies that inhabited the central provinces of Panama between the 8th and 11th centuries.
“This is where they buried their dead for 200 years,” said Ms Mayo.
Nine other tombs “similar” to the one found on Feb 20 had already been found at the site, she added.
Panama’s Ministry of Culture said the discovery was “of great importance for Panamanian archaeology and the study of pre-Hispanic societies of the Central American isthmus”, referring to the land that connects North and South America.
According to experts, these excavations demonstrate that death did not represent an end for these societies, but a transition to another phase where social status remained important. AFP

Evacuation orders as suspicious bushfire spreads
- Residents in Victoria, Australia, were instructed to evacuate on Saturday due to an out-of-control bushfire near Gaffneys Creek, northeast of Melbourne.
- Victorian emergency services issued the state's highest alert for areas around the A1 Mine Settlement as the fire rapidly spread across ridgelines.
- Police are investigating the bushfire as suspicious, with initial responders finding three separate ignition points, suggesting it may have been deliberately started.
- The blaze has consumed over 600 hectares in remote, mountainous terrain, making ground access difficult for the approximately 35 responding vehicles.
- Authorities are concerned about upcoming weather, including high temperatures, gusty winds, and thunderstorms, which could exacerbate the fire or cause flash flooding.

Flamingo cruise missiles hit Iskander and Oreshnik missile production plant in Udmurtia
Flamingo cruise missiles hit the strategic Votkinsk Plant, which produces Iskander, Topol-M and Oreshnik ballistic missiles, the enterprise is located approximately 1,300 km from the Ukrainian border, Militarnyi reports.
Military analysts at the portal reviewed footage of the aftermath, geolocated the blast site and confirmed that production facilities at the plant were damaged as a result of the Ukrainian strike, according to reports. They said Ukrainian Flamingo cruise missiles were used in the attack.
Local residents also published video showing a large fire on the plant’s grounds, the reports said. Additional photos released by residents showed blown-out windows in nearby residential buildings, suggesting the explosion was of significant force.
The outlet Militarnyi also reported, citing the Telegram channel Astra, that workshops No. 22 and No. 36 — where final assembly of missile systems takes place — were damaged in the strike.
Local authorities confirmed the attack as well. The head of the Udmurt Republic acknowledged damage and casualties "at one of the facilities," the outlet reported.
The Votkinsk Plant is one of Russia’s key manufacturers of solid-fuel ballistic missiles. The facility serially produces RS-24 Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles, previously manufactured and continues to service missiles of the Topol family, and also produces RSM-56 Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
Meanwhile, a representative of FirePoint published video on X showing missile launches, writing: "Here’s a short video. No context. Context — to follow."

Bitcoin causes 114 million tonnes of CO2 per year
The bitcoin network generates 114 million tonnes of CO2 per year. That is roughly the same as the Czech Republic, according to figures from the crypto portal Digiconomist.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
In addition, the network of the popular cryptocurrency consumes 3,222 gigalitres of drinking water. This is comparable to the total water consumption of Switzerland.
According to Digiconomist, a single bitcoin transaction currently generates as much CO2 as watching around 117,000 hours of YouTube videos, or processing 1.5 million Visa transactions.
The bitcoin network is based on blockchain technology. The challenge is to validate transactions on the blockchain in a forgery-proof manner.
+ Swiss central bank chief rejects holding bitcoin in reserves
So far, the “proof of work” method has been used for these systems. This involves solving complicated cryptographic puzzles, which ultimately generate bitcoins. This process is also known as “mining”.
In mining, many players compete with each other, but only one ultimately wins. This consumes a lot of electricity. This often comes from fossil fuel sources, which leads to high CO2 emissions.

Iranian foreign minister demands evidence from Trump regarding 32,000 alleged deaths during protests
US president says 32,000 people were killed in Iran over 'relatively short period of time'
ISTANBUL
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday dismissed US claims that 32,000 civilians were killed during protests in Iran, saying Tehran has already released official figures and calling for evidence to substantiate higher estimates.
"You know, the people of Iran are a lot different than the leaders of Iran, and it's very, very, very sad situation," US President Donald Trump said Friday, adding that 32,000 people were killed there over a "relatively short period of time."
In remarks through US social media company X, Araghchi said Tehran had already fulfilled its “pledge of full transparency” by publishing an official list documenting 3,117 victims of what he described as “recent terrorist operations,” including around 200 security personnel.
He added that “if anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence.”
Earlier Friday, Trump said he was "considering" a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal, without providing further details.
The latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, according to official figures.
Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of backing what they described as “rioting” and “terrorism.”
Iran and the US resumed nuclear negotiations earlier this month in the Omani capital Muscat, followed by another round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday under Oman's mediation.
The renewed diplomacy comes amid heightened regional tensions, fueled by a significant US military buildup in the Persian Gulf, as well as Iranian military drills.
Trump, speaking at the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, DC, on Thursday, warned that the US would opt for military action against Iran “within 10 to 15 days” if negotiations fail.

Putin Signs New Measure Tightening FSB Control Over Russian Internet

President Vladimir Putin signed into law a new measure giving Russia's main domestic intelligence agency new power to shut down the Internet inside the country.
The legislation, signed into law on February 20, was the latest in a series of regulations drastically tightening authorities' ability to restrict news and information inside of Russia.
The new measure, which was passed earlier this week by lawmakers, gives the Federal Security Service, known as the FSB, the power to demand that Internet service providers -- cellular or landline -- turn off or restrict access in cases "established by regulatory legal acts of the President of the Russian Federation."
The move allows Putin to personally decide when online communications in the country or a specific region should be turned off, without having to give a reason. It also removes any liability for the providers for doing so.
"Only the president can impose restrictions," Sarkis Darbinyan, a lawyer and longtime Internet activist, was quoted as saying. And presidential decrees are "even simpler than government decrees."
In recent months, Russian authorities have grappled with ways to stop Ukrainian drones from entering Russian airspace. In many cases, the drones use Russian data signals to fly at targets, in some cases over great distance.
Authorities have also clamped down on popular Internet tools, in particular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. Both apps have been throttled drastically amid a government push to get Russians to use a state-backed app called Max. One report said Telegram would be blocked entirely as of April 1.
Tech regulator Roskomnadzor accused Telegram, created by a now-exiled entrepreneur Pavel Durov, of creating a market for leaked personal information of Russian citizens.
The restrictions on Telegram have prompted pushback from bloggers who closely follow Russia's battlefield movements in Ukraine and raise money for Russian units. Telegram is also widely used by deployed Russian soldiers.
In an unusual warning, the FSB released a statement on February 21, asserting Ukrainian intelligence was able to access information posted on Telegram by Russian soldiers, and that "has repeatedly resulted in threats to the lives of service members" over the past three months.

Trial helps accelerate next gen atomic clock for UK military
United Kingdom

18:11:31 KST

A trial led by the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) has supported the development of next-generation atomic clock technology intended to strengthen the UK’s future military navigation and timing resilience.
Dstl said the work is aimed at improving Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) capabilities, which are currently heavily reliant on satellite systems such as GPS. The laboratory warned that satellite-based services can be denied or disrupted, potentially affecting operations across multiple environments.
Matthew Aldous, formerly Dstl’s theme lead for Quantum Sensing, said the next generation of atomic clocks would provide “new capabilities, better performance and improved resilience”.
“Timing plays a massive role in society, such as navigation for emergency services to banks dispensing cash from machines,” he said.
“We are building the next generation of atomic clocks which will provide new capabilities, better performance and improved resilience.”
Dstl explained that atomic clocks operate by using waves of light to energise atoms in a way that produces an extremely consistent frequency, allowing them to measure time with far greater accuracy than traditional systems.
The trial enabled manufacturers to test both individual components and complete devices over extended periods of unattended operation, providing what Dstl described as a more realistic deployment environment than standard laboratory testing.
The Royal Navy said the work has particular relevance for underwater navigation. Commander Matt Steele, Future Technology Officer for the Royal Navy’s Office of the Chief Technical Officer, said precise and persistent navigation is critical for both crewed submarines and uncrewed platforms.
“Having a navigation system that is precise, accurate and persistent to provide safe navigation underwater, whether for a crewed submarine or uncrewed vessel is critical for the Royal Navy,” he said.
He added that the experience gained from the trial has strengthened the UK’s position in the development of emerging navigation technologies.
Dstl also said the work could create commercial opportunities for UK industry. One of the participants, Far Field Exploits, a small enterprise founded by former military personnel, said the trial helped provide access to specialist test equipment and expertise.
Director Simon Merrett said: “We make a wireless time and frequency transfer system for atomic clocks. We didn’t have the test and measurement expertise in house or the specialist equipment. Dstl provided both of those which was a great collaboration.”
Dstl said a further trial is planned for 2027, expanding beyond atomic clocks and focusing on specific military challenges. The laboratory stated that its goal is for the UK to have deployed quantum navigation systems, including atomic clocks, on an aircraft by 2030.

Paris agricultural fair opens without famed cows as French farmers face multiple crises

This year, there will be no prize cow, no Charolais bulls, Tarentaise heifers, nor even a single calf. The complete absence of cattle in the popular Hall 1 of the Paris International Agricultural Show, on the opening day, Saturday, February 21, will leavea strong impression.
Even though President Emmanuel Macron expressed concern over the unprecedented situation and explicitly requested that the animals be present at the show, livestock farmers have stood firm. They refused to risk their animals' health for the sake of parading them in the capital. Politicians will, therefore, miss out on the traditional photo opportunities granted by the show: arriving at milking time, posing with cattle, strolling the aisles, surrounded by magnificent prize-winning animals.
The lack of cattle sends a powerful signal about the fear and shock generated by the latest livestock health crisis, the lumpy skin disease epidemic that has severely rocked the cattle sector since the summer of 2025, when it first appeared in the Alps.
As for poultry, they have been absent from the show since 2019, when the first major bird flu outbreak struck the country. Even though this year's wave was less severe, thanks to a country-wide duck vaccination campaign, the epidemic is still very much present. France declared a "high risk" for avian influenza at the end of October 2025, and the Agriculture Ministry had recorded 118 outbreaks by mid-February. As a result, bringing hens, roosters, ducks or guinea fowl to Paris was out of the question.

Hong Kong government offers to buy apartment ownerships from fire victims
Hong Kong’s government is offering to buy back homeownership rights from residents displaced by last year’s deadly Wang Fuk Court fire
- Bookmark
Hong Kong officials on Saturday unveiled resettlement plans for thousands of people who were displaced by the deadliest blaze in decades last November, proposing to buy back the homeownership rights from the fire victims.
Almost three months after the massive blaze spread across seven apartment buildings in Wang Fuk Court, its former occupants have been living in uncertainty about when they would find somewhere they could call home again.
Many of them are adjusting to new lives in their temporary homes scattered across various districts, with the government offering rental grants to help homeowners pay for the short-term accommodation.
Officials said in a news conference on Saturday that homeowners of the seven buildings can sell their ownership rights for cash to secure accommodation of their choice or buy an apartment under a designated government policy. Residents who prefer not to deal with a large amount of cash can directly exchange an apartment under the policy.
The government estimated that buying back the rights of some 1,700 units would cost about 6.8 billion Hong Kong dollars ($870 million), with about 4 billion Hong Kong dollars ($512 million) of that sum to be from public funds and the rest to be covered by a relief fund.
Michael Wong, the city’s Deputy Financial Secretary, said the administration was inclined to dismantle the seven buildings and would not redevelop residential homes on the fire site. It could be transformed into a park or community facilities instead.
Wong said there's no reasonable or cost-effective way to repair the damaged buildings, and if the government doesn't intervene, it will be hard for homeowners to find buyers in the market.
“In other words, the funds they have invested in these units over the years could turn to nothing," he said.
The government aims to contact the homeowners in March and hopes to pay the owners in the third quarter of this year, he said.
The proposals came after affected residents were surveyed about their preferences. Wong said 74% of the respondents were willing to consider selling their ownership rights to the government. Some 9% of those who answered the survey said they would only accept redevelopment at the fire site, which the government expected to take about a decade, he said.
The blaze killed 168 people on Nov. 26, 2025, and has shattered a close-knit community in the suburban district of Tai Po. Authorities blamed substandard scaffold netting and foam boards used in a maintenance project for rapidly spreading the fire. Although some arrests were made, an independent committee is still investigating the cause.

Trump’s tariff defeat creates a new wave of uncertainty for businesses and exporters

From European wine makers to chemical companies and distillers, the US Supreme Court ruling knocking down a large part of President Donald Trump's trade tariffs comes with a sting in the tail: an even more uncertain trade outlook.
In a decision that will ripple through the global economy, the top US court struck down Trump's sweeping tariffs imposed under a law meant for use in national emergencies, handing a stinging defeat to the Republican president.
But while many businesses cheered after lengthy legal battles against tariffs, European trade groups, companies, and analysts worried that the ruling may make trade relations even messier after hard-struck trade deals last year.
"This ruling ... risks creating a boomerang effect, producing further uncertainty and a freeze on orders while operators wait for a clearer regulatory framework," said Paolo Castelletti, secretary general of Italian wine association UIV.
The US is the top market for Italian wines, with some 1.9 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in exports in 2024, making up almost a quarter of Italy's total wine shipments globally.
Many firms cautioned that Trump would likely look to other avenues to impose similar tariffs, dulling the benefit of lower levies, while the move could stoke tensions between the US and major trade partners. Tariff refunds will also be hard to get.
Responding to the ruling, Trump announced new global tariffs of 10% for an initial 150-day period and acknowledged it was not clear if or when there would be any refunds.
A new wave of uncertainty
Steve Ovara, chair of the International Trade Practice Group at law firm King & Spalding, said that companies his firm advises, from large US manufacturers to consumer and technology groups, mostly expected any relief from tariffs to be short-lived.
"The major issue everybody's going to be dealing with for at least the short term is some additional uncertainty," he said.
Wolfgang Grosse Entrup, managing director of German chemicals and pharmaceutical lobby VCI, which represents firms like BASF, Bayer, and Evonik, agreed.
"For our firms, this isn't the start of a phase of stability, but a new round of uncertainty. Anyone who believes this means the tariff conflict is over is mistaken," he said. "New tariffs based on a different legal basis are possible at any time."
Peter Sand, chief analyst at freight pricing platform Xeneta, said political risk remained for shippers, with trends to de-risk supply chains an "irreversible trend."
"The damage to many shippers' supply chains is largely done and probably won't be undone," he said.
French cosmetics association FEBEA, which has firms like L'Oreal as members, said it was "very cautious" on the ruling and would watch how the US government responded, including with potential new tariffs.
'Just another complication'
"We are all used to the twists and turns on this subject of customs duties," said FEBEA secretary general Emmanuel Guichard.
Massimiliano Giansanti, president of Italian farmers' group Confagricoltura, said the US ruling "dismantles the entire legal basis" for Trump's tariffs, but warned it complicated things for exporters just as they were adapting to US tariffs.
"All this generates deep instability at a time when we need certainty and have begun a process together with our US importers," he said.
In Ireland, whiskey exporters are waiting to see what happens next before taking action, said Eoin Ó Catháin, Director of the Irish Whiskey Association, adding political negotiations and de-escalation were more likely to resolve tariff challenges.
"This isn't a silver bullet to get rid of tariffs," he said. "This is just another complication, it's another twist in the story."

Food for friends: Thai food finds a home in Doha’s multicultural dining scene

In Doha’s vibrant dining scene, international cuisines bring people together, offering moments of shared culture, hospitality and everyday connection across communities.
In Doha’s cosmopolitan food culture, cuisines from around the world are part of daily life. Thai food has become one of them reflecting the relationship between Thailand and Qatar.
Across the city, Thai restaurants are part of everyday dining, whether for quick lunches, family meals or social gatherings. Their presence mirrors the steady movement of people between the two countries through tourism, work and cultural exchange.
For many in Qatar, food remains one of the most familiar ways cultures are shared.
Mohannad Ibrahim Bitar, a Qatari-based influencer and entrepreneur, says meals naturally bring people together.
“Just the sheer activity of food gathers people,” he says. “When you meet up with someone, you go like, let’s have a coffee. When you want to catch up with somebody, let’s go for dinner, go for lunch. It’s never, let’s just go and talk.”
He adds that eating together is something universal.
“Food is, by default, a connecting activity. It’s something that everyone needs to do at least two times a day. So anywhere you go in the world, food, food, food.”
Thai food as culture
Thai cuisine also carries cultural meaning beyond taste.
H.E. Mr. Sira Swangsilpa, Thailand’s outgoing ambassador to Qatar, says preparing Thai food reflects hospitality and care.
“Modern Thai food is Thai hospitality as well,” he says. “You prepare one Thai dish, it takes your time and your intention and everything you have to do it from the inner.”
He explains that this effort is part of how Thai culture is shared abroad.
“That represents our effort and our hospitality through the food. So many people visit Thailand and they love our 'Thainess' and Thai hospitality and Thai food is one of our Thai hospitality extend to our foreign guests worldwide.”
Hospitality across cultures
In Qatar, hospitality has long been expressed through meals as well.
Jamal AlShebani, a Qatari influencer and co-founder of Bisht Magazine, says welcoming guests with food is deeply rooted in local culture.
“Food has always been, even in our culture in Qatar, when we have a guest, we usually feed him, whether it be rice, or the coffees, or dates,” he says.
He adds that food can also communicate culture itself. “Food is a very unique tool that we can use to spread our culture, share our culture.”
As Thai cuisine becomes part of daily dining in Doha, it reflects how cultural exchange often happens in ordinary settings rather than formal ones.
Meals, restaurants and shared tables continue to shape how people from different backgrounds experience one another’s traditions.
In a city built on global connections, Thai food has found a natural place, not only on menus, but in the everyday encounters that bring cultures closer.

On the day the staggering scale of Assaf Rappaport and his three partners' exit from Wiz became clear – the Israeli startup was sold to Google in March 2025 for $32 billion – some dared to hope that part of the vast windfall might be directed toward the public struggle against the coalition of destruction and dictatorship that's dragging the country downward. A Tel Aviv liberal, involved from the outset in the battle over Israel's democratic character, was involved in that whole mind-boggling deal? There could hardly have been better news for the exhausted masses protesting in the streets for over two years and in dire need of a shot in the arm.

Iran has strongly condemned recent Israeli attacks on Lebanon, including strikes targeting the Bekaa region and the Palestinian refugee camp of Ain al-Hilweh in Sidon, which resulted in more than 40 civilians killed and injured.
Condemning the Israeli aggression, the spokesperson of Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Esmaeil Baghaei, said that the attacks represent a serious violation of Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the November 2024 ceasefire agreement.
Baghaei stressed that the United States and France, as guarantors of the ceasefire, bear direct responsibility for preventing continued violations.
He further called on the United Nations and the UN Security Council to fulfill their legal obligations and take immediate action to halt further military escalation.
Concluding his remarks, Baghaei reiterated that repeated breaches of Lebanon’s sovereignty undermine regional stability and require decisive international accountability measures.

US Supreme Court tariff decision triggers new uncertainties in trade
Ruling that International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant president tariff authority fuels debates about fate of billions of dollars in customs duties collected by Trump administration
- Uncertainties regarding trade agreement negotiations expected to increase as Trump states he will continue to implement tariffs through other methods
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON
A US Supreme Court ruling that said President Donald Trump's "emergency" tariffs are illegal, increased uncertainties about the future of the customs duties collected and trade agreements Washington made with other countries.
The court ruled Friday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), on which the tariffs put into effect by President Donald Trump were based, did not grant the president the authority to impose tariffs.
The 6-3 decision emphasized that the authority to impose customs duties belongs to Congress.
Trump imposed "reciprocal" customs duties on almost all US trade partners last year under the IEEPA, and introduced tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, citing the flow of fentanyl into the country.
Noting that the government interpreted the IEEPA as a law granting the president the authority to "unilaterally impose unbounded tariffs and change them at will," the court’s decision pointed out that in the half-century history of the law, no president had used the act even to impose any customs duty, let alone tariffs of the size and scope Trump imposed.
The ruling stated that the phrase "regulating" in the law did not sweep Congress's power to "set tariff policy," and the power to “regulate … importation” does not fill that void.
Stating that the IEEPA gives the president the authority to regulate imports on various issues, such as investigating, preventing and prohibiting, the decision noted that customs duties or fees were never mentioned in the long list of special powers.
Uncertainty for collected tariffs
While the decision puts a legal block on the Trump administration's trade policies, it created a massive cloud of uncertainty regarding the fate of billions of dollars in customs duties recently collected under the IEEPA and the US foreign trade commitments.
According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the amount collected for tariffs under the IEEPA that might need to be refunded was estimated to be more than $175 billion.
The decision did not present a concrete roadmap for the refund of the customs duties collected, but the court's release included the opinion of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who dissented, that the US may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers and refunds of billions of dollars would have significant consequences for the US Treasury Department.
Trump announces 10% global tariff
Trump, in a news conference held after the ruling, said it was "deeply disappointing" and he was ashamed of some members of the court.
"The good news is that there are methods, practices, statutes and authorities, as recognized by the entire court in this terrible decision — and also as recognized by Congress," said Trump.
Arguing that the Supreme Court's decision made a president's authority to regulate trade and impose customs duties stronger and clearer, Trump explained that he thought the tariffs would generate more revenue than before.
Trump announced that he would sign a decision to implement a 10% global tariff in addition to the currently applied tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, adding that they would launch various investigations under Section 301 and other articles to protect the US from the unfair trade practices of other countries and companies.
Criticizing the absence of a provision regarding the refund of tariffs in the decision, Trump stated that the situation would be the subject of litigation for years.
Regarding the trade agreements negotiated using IEEPA tariffs, Trump said many deals are valid, some will not be valid and will be replaced by "other alternatives."
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said that using alternative legal authorities for customs duties would leave tariff revenues "virtually unchanged" in 2026.
Bessent pointed out that the court did not rule against the tariffs, but only that the IEEPA could not be used for that purpose.
What happens next?
Import companies are expected to file class-action lawsuits for the refund of the taxes they already paid by citing the court’s decision as a precedent.
Reports in the US media indicate that importers have already filed more than 1,000 lawsuits at the Court of International Trade to demand refunds, and a new influx of lawsuits is expected to begin.
Some small importers might give up the potential refund instead of paying thousands of dollars in legal and court fees to file a lawsuit, it was reported.
While experts warn that the process could technically turn into chaos, it is expressed that legal regulations regarding which product group, in which date range, and how much refund the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) unit will make could take months or even years.
As Kavanaugh expressed in his opinion, it is reported that the ruling did not completely eliminate the president's authority to impose tariffs, but only ruled that he chose the wrong legal option by imposing customs duties under the IEEPA.
As Trump also stated, it is noted that the US administration can use other federal laws in the upcoming period, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, citing national security, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, authorizing action against unfair trade practices of foreign countries, or Section 122 targeting foreign trade deficits.
However, unlike the IEEPA, those laws require more complex bureaucratic and procedural steps, such as additional investigations, public comments and reports from specific institutions.
Are trade agreements in danger?
While the Trump administration used IEEPA tariffs as a bargaining chip in trade diplomacy with many countries, the Supreme Court's decision also creates uncertainty for the fate of trade agreements worth trillions of dollars that have already been signed or are under negotiation.
Experts state that trade partners will now increasingly price in the risk that "agreements made with the US President can be overturned by the judiciary.”
It is also noteworthy that Kavanaugh included the statement in his dissenting opinion: "The IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars—including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more.
"The Court’s decision could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements."
Spokespersons for the EU and the UK governments stated that they would be in contact with the US to gain more clarity about the effects of the decision.
Another bout of trade policy uncertainty
Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, told Anadolu that the ruling immediately lowers the effective tariff rate sharply, from 12.8% to 8.3%.
Sweet noted that any boost to the economy from lowering tariffs in the near-term is likely to be partly offset by a prolonged period of uncertainty, and with the administration likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable means, the overall tariff rate may yet end up settling close to current levels.
Sweet stated that the 6-3 ruling was unambiguous in striking down the emergency declaration underpinning much of the reciprocal by-country tariffs put in place last year.
He added that the Supreme Court did not rule on whether the administration must refund the more than $130 billion in tariffs already paid under the declarations, which will likely trigger a prolonged legal battle.
Sweet highlighted that the administration has frequently emphasized other powers it could use to rebuild much of the tariff regime struck down by the decision.
The White House may turn to Section 122 to immediately implement an up to 15% tariff on all imports for as many as 150 days before requiring congressional approval for an extension, he said.
That could serve as a bridge while the administration pursues other trade authorities, which require investigations but are more legally durable, he stated.
"Even if the administration is able to replicate the overall level of tariffs using other means, the by-sector and by-country implications could end up looking very different, which will create another bout of trade policy uncertainty for business, investors, and households," said Sweet.
He warned that the uncertainty is a key downside risk that could ding, rather than derail, growth this year.
Decision puts trade agreements at risk
Olu Sonola, head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, stated that the 10% tariff may ultimately help reduce uncertainty once the dust finally settles.
Sonola noted, howeverm that at this point, it is still unknown whether the 10% blanket tariff is truly a blanket -- whether it will spare consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, and the many other sectors previously exempted under the IEEPA.
Pointing out that the refund process is likely to be vigorously litigated in the months ahead, Sonola said the Supreme Court’s decision gives companies and consumers a clear legal basis to demand their money back.
The ruling also puts trade agreements with tariff rates above 10% at real risk, Sonola mentioned.
Emphasizing that countries negotiating the deals are not the ones paying the bill but rather corporations and consumers are, he stated that if the tariff is deemed illegal, there is no legal justification for continuing to charge rates higher than the 10% allowed under Section 122.
Noting that global markets will probably shrug it off for now, Sonola said that may change as there is greater clarity on how it plays out.
"In fact, the decision could ultimately benefit many Asian and European countries that currently face IEEPA tariff rates in excess of 10%," he added.

Farmers in Gaza risk Israeli bullets to bring their fields back to life
Gaza farmers face risks as Israeli buffer zones expand into their agricultural lands under heavy military control.
The Gaza Strip – As soon as the “ceasefire” in Gaza began in October, Palestinian farmer Mohammed al-Slakhy and his family headed straight for their farms in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City.
After more than two years of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza – and despite ongoing Israeli attacks – it was finally safe enough to return, and attempt to rebuild and restore.

Mohammed and his family spent months clearing rubble from the ground and whatever was left of their greenhouses, which were flattened during the fighting, like many of the buildings in Gaza.
With very limited resources, they prepared the soil and planted the first courgette crop, hoping it would be ready to harvest by early spring.
But even this limited attempt to bring the family’s land back to life is not without risk. As Mohammed explains, every time he goes to tend to his field, he is risking his life. A few hundred metres away sit Israeli tanks, and the sound of bullets flying by is common.
Before the war, Mohammed’s farm produced large quantities of vegetables.
“I learned farming from my father and grandfather,” he told Al Jazeera. “Our farm used to produce abundant, high-quality crops for the local market and for export to the [occupied] West Bank and abroad. Now, everything we had has been destroyed in the war.”
Levelled to the ground
More than three hectares (7.5 acres) of Mohammed’s greenhouses were levelled to the ground. The destruction also included his entire irrigation network, all nine of his wells, two solar power systems, and two desalination plants.
Mohammed’s losses reflect the wider extent of the damage to the agricultural sector in Gaza. According to a July 2025 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), more than 80 percent of cropland was damaged, and less than 5 percent remained available for cultivation.
And even with the “ceasefire”, the losses have not stopped for Gaza’s farmers, as Israel expands a so-called buffer zone, within which its forces are based.
In fact, many Palestinians fear that Gaza’s agricultural lands will be forcibly taken by Israel if the buffer zone becomes a permanent fixture. Blueprints released as part of United States President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” plan for Gaza show many agricultural areas erased.
Expanding buffer zones
Israel still controls about 58 percent of the Gaza Strip, calling it a security buffer zone in the east, north, and south of the Gaza Strip. The majority of that buffer zone is Palestinian agricultural land.
Mohammed has only been able to return to one hectare (2.5 acres) of the more than 22 hectares (54 acres) of farmland his family had cultivated in Gaza City before the war. The other 21 hectares lie within the Israeli buffer zone, and he cannot access them.
The solitary hectare is only about 200 metres (650 feet) from the “yellow line”, which marks the border between the buffer zone and the rest of Gaza. Mohammed says that Israeli tanks frequently approach and fire randomly.
One such incident occurred on February 12, when Israeli tanks advanced into Salah al-Din Street and opened fire. Two Palestinians were killed, and at least four others were reported wounded. Mohammed was in his farmland, close to the Israeli tanks.
“We were working in the field when suddenly a tank approached and opened fire towards us. I had to take cover behind a destroyed building and waited there for more than an hour and a half before I could escape west,” Mohammed said.
The dangers to Mohammed’s farm are mirrored in central Gaza, where 75-year-old Eid al-Taaban is increasingly worried.
His land in Deir el-Balah lies only about 300 metres (980 feet) from the yellow line and the Israeli areas of control.
“We planted eggplants in an open field after the ceasefire. Now, we can’t reach it and harvest the crop because of the expansion of the buffer zone,” Eid told Al Jazeera.
“The sounds of Israeli heavy machineguns are heard every day in our area. Every time my sons go to irrigate the crops in the greenhouses, I just pray that they come back alive,” he added.
On February 6, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the Israeli army killed Palestinian farmer Khaled Baraka while he was working on his land in eastern Deir el-Balah. Khaled was Eid’s neighbour and friend.
“Khaled Baraka was a great farmer,” Eid said. “He dedicated his life to cultivating his land and teaching his sons and daughters about farming.”
Israeli blockade
According to Palestinian farmers, the Israeli blockade of Gaza is one of the biggest challenges they face in their efforts to reclaim agricultural land.
Since October 7, 2023, Israel has largely prevented the entry of any agricultural equipment or supplies, such as seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, irrigation networks, or tractors.
That has led to a huge shortage, with what is available still liable to being damaged in bombing, or in the case of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers, reaching expiry. The prices of what little is available have also skyrocketed due to the Israeli restrictions.
And even when the materials can be obtained, they do not guarantee a return.
Eid said that he had planted tomatoes in his greenhouses to harvest in the spring, paying an exorbitant amount to acquire the seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides.
After 90 days of costly care for the plants, and when it was time to start harvesting, the entire crop was ruined because the pesticides and fertilisers he had bought turned out to be ineffective. He was forced to replant the crop.
Market difficulties
Eid noted that the current economic conditions in Gaza mean that it is hard to find customers for the produce.
“Even when we manage to keep the plants alive and harvest the crop, we don’t know if we’ll be able to sell it,” Eid said.
The instability of the market in Gaza is causing heavy losses for local farmers.
Waleed Miqdad, an agricultural produce wholesaler, explained that Israeli authorities sometimes close the crossings and at other times flood the market with various goods, causing significant losses for Palestinian farmers.
He added that Israeli goods are usually of a lower quality and are priced more cheaply.
“Our local produce, although much fewer in quantity than before the war, still has a distinctive quality and taste. Many of our customers prefer local produce,” Waleed told Al Jazeera.
But many residents of Gaza, whose economy has been devastated as a result of the war, do not have the money to be able to choose the higher-priced items.
The competition from Israeli produce is therefore making it difficult for Palestinian farmers to market their produce and make a profit.
“I was recently forced to sell large quantities of my produce for less than the cost of production because of the competition from imported goods that are widely available in the market,” said Mohammed, the farmer from northern Gaza. “I had to sell and lose or watch my produce rot. And of course, we haven’t received any compensation or support.”
Despite the challenges facing the farmers in Gaza, they remain determined to reclaim agricultural fields across the Gaza Strip. These areas have always been adored by Palestinians in Gaza, where most had lived in the built-up cities. The farms provided a respite from Israel’s control over the territory and its constant wars.
“Agriculture is our life and our livelihood,” said Mohammed. “It is an important part of our Palestinian identity. Despite the destruction and danger, we will remain steadfast on our land and will replant all the land we can reach. Our children will continue after us.”
For Eid, farming is a continuation of the work of his ancestors – in towns that are now in Israel, and where he can never set foot.
“I’m 75 years old, and I still work in the fields every day,” Eid said. “My grandfather was a farmer in our hometown of Beersheba before the [1948] Nakba.”
“He taught my father, my father taught me, and today I’m passing on my agricultural expertise to my grandchildren,” Eid added. “The love of the land and agriculture is passed down from generation to generation in our family, and it can never be taken away from us.”

Inside Sweden: How a Swedish pizzeria in London unexpectedly reminded me of home

I spent a few days in London this week visiting family, where I unexpectedly stumbled upon a Swedish-style pizzeria, complete with blue-and-yellow signage and a menu featuring the most Swedish of pizzas, kebabpizza (extra fries on top for just a pound).
My reaction was surprising – I instantly felt more at home, which is odd considering that I’m from the UK. I’ve had a similar reaction in Sweden seeing restaurant menus featuring British food like bangers and mash or afternoon tea, but this was the first time I’d responded like this to something Swedish.
I had a similar reaction watching the Winter Olympics, where I found myself cheering for both Swedish and British athletes, despite the fact that I only hold UK citizenship.
The truth is, I’ve spent more than eight years away from my home country. I still consider myself British and still have friends and family there, but things have also changed a lot since I left. I find myself more and more behind when it comes to things like popular TV shows or trends back home, with my tastes and habits becoming increasingly Swedish over time.
In my first few years outside the UK, a menu advertising British fish and chips would excite me, and I often visited supermarkets and shops stocking my favourite chocolate and salt and vinegar crisps from back home.
Now, however, I get the same reaction when I see a blue-and-yellow restaurant selling kebabpizza in a UK city, and my Swedish husband is more excited about British food than I am.
I wonder if it will ever get easier, or if I will constantly find myself missing British things in Sweden or Swedish things on trips back to the UK.
Most of all, though, I’m happy that I have two countries I can call home.

Saudi Arabia raises concerns with UAE over Sudan war and Yemen policy: report

Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has sent a lengthy letter to a senior Emirati official outlining Riyadh’s grievances over the UAE’s role in Sudan and Yemen, according to a report published on Friday by the news outlet Middle East Eye.
Citing multiple US and Western officials, the outlet reported that the Saudi crown prince recently wrote to Tahnoon bin Zayed, the UAE’s national security adviser, raising concerns about Abu Dhabi’s policies in the two conflict zones and seeking mediation.
The letter, sent several weeks ago, included a detailed list of Saudi complaints regarding Emirati activities in Sudan’s ongoing civil war and in neighbouring Yemen. It also proposed mediation through the crown prince’s brother and defence minister, Khalid bin Salman.
According to the report, the message said Riyadh could no longer "tolerate" the continuation of Sudan’s civil war while the UAE was backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.
The letter justified Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen as necessary for national security and reaffirmed that the kingdom sees Yemen as its sphere of influence, planning to take “responsibility” for the war-torn country on its southern border.
Officials cited in the report said Saudi Arabia shared the letter with the US. Neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE has publicly commented on the reported correspondence.

Views of corruption in Philippines worsen as ‘grease money’ dents confidence
A global index on corruption perceptions shows the Philippines posting its lowest ranking since 2012
Berlin-based watchdog Transparency International said the Philippines ranked 120th out of 182 countries and territories in its 2025 Corruption Perceptions Index, down six places from the previous year.
The country received a score of 32 on a scale of zero as “highly corrupt” to 100 being “very clean”, one point less than its score in 2024 and the lowest it has received since 2012.
The index released on February 10 aggregates expert and business assessments of perceived public-sector corruption, including risks of bribery, diversion of public funds, abuse of office, the strength of accountability and whistle-blower protections. It draws on data collected over several years up to late 2025.
The ranking comes against the backdrop of an ongoing controversy in the Philippines over alleged irregularities in government-funded flood-control projects that first surfaced in July last year. Investigations and fraud audits have uncovered billions of pesos lost to purportedly substandard or “ghost” flood-control works, with multiple anti-corruption protests held across the country following the revelations.

Starmer 2.0: could a more authentic PM revive Labour’s appeal?

Two days after Keir Starmer had been disowned by the Scottish Labour leader last week, and as a row raged over another controversial peerage, the prime minister decided to pick a fight with a billionaire.
It was a dark week for the prime minister, with the departure of his longtime chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, who had become a deeply divisive figure and who took the hit for the appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassador, despite his links to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
But last Thursday morning had – for a change – been dominated by a different story. Top of the bulletins were comments from Jim Ratcliffe, the Monaco-based Manchester United owner, who said the UK had been “colonised by immigrants”, citing wildly inaccurate figures.
The previous afternoon, when the comments were first broadcast, Starmer tweeted to proactively condemn them as “offensive and wrong”. Britain, he said “is a proud, tolerant and diverse country” and he called on Ratcliffe to apologise.
It is small scale in the scheme of things. But it was gesture that aides say will be a symbol of a much bigger shift.
“A few months ago we would not have done that,” said one adviser. “There would have been an internal row over whether it would look soft on immigration. But we know what the prime minister thinks, we know what he would want to say, so why are we hesitating?”
Starmer’s premiership is assumed to be doomed given the widespread anger at the last 18 months among MPs and the public. But there is a growing consensus in the cabinet that the lack of a plausible successor, and of one with the guts to challenge Starmer, means he may survive for much longer than predicted.
“Everyone is chastened by the coup that never was,” one cabinet minister said, referring to Anas Sarwar’s call for Starmer to resign, which did not see anyone else follow.
Strategists also do not believe the electoral position is terminal, despite some polls putting Labour in third or fourth. In most, the gap is about five to eight points with Reform UK, but a series of polls show voters are motivated to vote tactically to stop Nigel Farage, mostly to Labour’s benefit.
The exception, however, is that most voters say they would back the Greens in seats that are a straight fight between them and Labour.
The shift from Labour to Greens will be tested on Thursday at the Gorton and Denton byelection, where Labour, the Greens and Reform are fighting over a once-safe Labour seat.
Labour sources say they are increasingly optimistic about their chances of winning, having seen a record number of volunteers sign up to help, with about 500 activists campaigning on recent weekends.
They believe warnings to progressive voters about the divisiveness of Reform, coupled with attacks on the Greens’ liberal approach to drug laws, will help them to victory. Labour sources this week highlighted a Green party policy to legalise GHB, a drug that has been used in date rapes, for recreational purposes.
But party figures admit that for their strategy to work, they must work harder to avoid angering progressives.
“The one thing we must absolutely change is gratuitously pissing off our own voters,” said one senior minister. “It became somehow pervasive in the operation that we should not defend our values when it came to racism or gender or diversity, lest it anger Reform-curious voters.
“I tell you who we did anger: we angered our own core voters by just letting this evil stuff slide.”
McSweeney was often blamed as the blocker – though he was an advocate of a more ferocious approach to attacking Farage, he preferred a strategy that would have emphasised a different kind of patriotism.
Senior figures close to the prime minister who remain in the operation believe Starmer should show he is prepared to vocally defend Labour values – like his tweet to Ratcliffe did.
They include the chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, and the acting co-chief of staff, Vidhya Alakeson.
No 10 sources also pointed to the robust way that Starmer and the government responded to X’s AI tool Grok when it was used to create non-consensual images of women in bikinis and compromising positions.
When Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, criticised Starmer and Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, in grotesque terms last summer, the official response was far more muted. There have been other examples, too, including on Thursday attacking Reform’s plan to scrap the Equality Act, saying the legislation was British at its core and represented “basic values”.
There have been many egregious failures on this front over the past year. One that sparked an internal row came over how No 10 and Labour should respond to the Conservative shadow minister Katie Lam calling for the deportation of legally settled people until the UK was mostly “culturally coherent”.
Initially, the formal response from the party criticised only the practicality of such a policy and reiterated Labour’s commitment to tackling illegal immigration. There was private fury among Labour MPs. “I actually could not believe that was our line,” one minister recalled.
Starmer was not even asked for his own view until preparation for prime minister’s questions four days later, where he told aides he thought it was a moral outrage and said he would respond very robustly if asked about it in the Commons – which he wasn’t.
One ally said it was “a farce” that the prime minister himself had not been given the opportunity to give his own view – even internally – until he brought it up himself during a broadcast interview on the Friday, almost a week after the comments were first made.
This was a strategy that would please no one, several aides admitted. “There are areas where there are real issues that need to be tackled like crime and border security, which we can show in our policies,” a senior aide said. “But we do not need to be aping Reform on cultural issues. That’s not who we are.
“I think a lot of that got blamed on Morgan and his team unfairly. They pushed the hardline immigration stuff, but they did not believe we should be holding back on attacking Farage. But being afraid to defend or say anything progressive became the centre of gravity in No 10 in a way that was almost inexplicable.”
There are other new approaches forming. Among the newer staff in Labour HQ and No 10, there is now an acceptance that the “hero voter”, which the party chased in opposition – working-class, white, older and pro-Brexit voters – were not those that delivered the 2024 election victory.
Much of this is borne out in post-election research. The voters Labour won were overwhelmingly younger working people and often graduates; more liberal, and pro-Remain.
The large but shallow majority was built on stretched professionals in aspirational areas such as Altrincham, Kettering or Corby, struggling with costs of childcare, mortgages and reliance on public services.
“There’s sometimes a bit of a debate about stereotypes and whether ex-factory workers or young urban grads are our core vote – both kind of miss the point,” one government source said.
“It’s people aged 30-65: families, potentially with kids or adult children still living at home, maybe an elderly parent in need of occasional support. These people tend to be towards the peak of their lifetime earnings, but also have significant cost pressures: housing, maybe childcare, or if they’re a bit older, starting to think about retirement or helping an older child get on with a career.”
For those voters, there are key fights Labour can pick beyond the economy that resonate, which is why Starmer has signalled he is prepared to consider a ban on social media for under-16s – a highly popular policy with parents, but one he had previously rejected as anti-growth and a fringe issue.
But relentless controversies have meant that any real change of strategy has been haphazard at best.
Since Christmas, Starmer had intended to do a major speech on his own values versus those of Reform – one that would hark back to his conference speech, where he railed against the “politics of division”.
The plan for the speech was to use the announcement about £800m Pride in Place funding. Departmental sources said it had been held for some time to allow the prime minister to use it as a moment to define himself against Reform.
But the speech was totally overshadowed by the Mandelson scandal, and barely made a single headline. Insiders blamed the failure to delay that speech on the now-departed communications chief, Tim Allan.
That role and chief of staff remain unfilled in No 10, leaving Starmer without crucial senior aides who could help turn a tentative new approach into something that feels like a more meaningful story to tell the nation.
To redefine Starmer for the post-McSweeney era is an unenviable task, and one many will suspect has a shelf life – the prime minister will almost certainly face renewed leadership threats in the coming months.
There is also a pervading view that Starmer is not loyal to those who serve him and rarely shows any appreciation for the toll it takes.
Almost all of the architects of that campaign are now gone, either out of frustration or scandal – most notably McSweeney. Starmer, who finds it hard to build trust, has just one remaining adviser who has stayed the course: his policy adviser Stuart Ingham – though Jill Cuthbertson, now acting as co-chief of staff, and Sophie Nazemi, who is interim comms chief, are long-serving Labour figures.
Each communications chief has tried different tactics. Allan, for instance, attempted to get the prime minister’s authentic voice to show through longer-form interviews and podcasts.
But barring one or two where Starmer talked with authentic passion about classical music, or his anguish at the death of his brother, he has often lapsed quickly back into robotic talking points.
“I think sometimes our communications geniuses have confused the idea that voters need to have more personal empathy with the prime minister with him showing empathy with voters,” one recently departed adviser said.
But almost all the staff who spoke to the Guardian agreed it was in his angry reactions to Reform that Starmer sounded at his most authentic. If Labour wins in Gorton and Denton on Thursday, he will be more empowered to continue in this vein.
“I think he has decided he is up for having this fight – he actually decided it before his conference speech in September,” one friend of the prime minister said. “Often the operation has been behind where he is himself on this.”

Dan was killed at Bondi. His friends want him remembered for so much more
Krystal Troyano couldn’t shake a niggling fear in the days after her husband, Dan Elkayam, was killed in the Bondi shooting.
“What I really didn’t want to happen was for Dan to be remembered for the last five minutes of his life. This was bothering me a lot, to see him [described] in the news as Dan, the guy who died,” Troyano said.
“It was just five minutes of 27 years of living life so f---ng fully.”
Troyano said the idea for a tournament to pay tribute to Elkayam, a French citizen, engineer and semi-professional footballer, materialised in the days after the December 14 terror attack, when she was “grieving and so, so sad”.
Dozens of Elkayam’s friends and former teammates joined seven teams for the inaugural Dan’s Legacy Cup tournament to remember his life – rather than the way he died – at Barracluff Park in North Bondi on Saturday.
“We started having this fire in our hearts to make this meaningful somehow. Everything related to Dan is related to football as well. All his dreams were related to football, the memories of people and the deep love he had for it,” she said.
“This is why he went to Bondi that day – to play football. Football for him represented being around friends, laughing, at the beach, and just having a good time. He was such a great guy.”
Elkayam was at Bondi Beach, kicking a football with mates in the sun, and preparing to celebrate his Jewish faith by watching the lighting of the menorah at the Chanukah by the Sea event in the hours before he was shot.
The eastern suburbs resident has been remembered as a passionate footballer who played for Rockdale Ilinden FC’s Premier League side, and represented France and the Jewish community at the 2022 Maccabiah Games in Israel.
Players from the Rockdale side were among those who played in the Dan’s Legacy Cup on Saturday, stopping briefly for a minute’s silence before they all clapped and shouted, “One, two, three, for Dan” and ran back onto the field.
Elkayam’s former teammate Gaetan Faraci said the Frenchmen met in Australia and bonded over football.
Faraci said he had woken on Saturday, ready to head to Bondi to play football, and thought: “I’m going to see Dan today.”
“This is Dan’s area, he was always around Bondi, always wanting to go to the beach just to kick the ball.
“It’s very hard for me, personally, to go to Bondi Beach still.”
Faraci had last played alongside Elkayam the weekend before the shooting, when their team of French players, Casanowra City, had won the Project Volta Super League football tournament.
Faraci said members of the team were competing in Saturday’s event to help keep Elkayam’s memory alive.
“Every day we talk to Dan, and we feel like he’s still with us. He was such a good guy, such a treasure. This kind of person marked your life because of his kindness. We’re still waiting for him to come back.”
Troyano, who is from Brazil, met Elkayam at a Sydney hostel soon after each arrived in Australia in 2022. She said the pair had quietly married in Australia nearly two years ago, but had only told their friends at the time.
“We wanted to do everything fast,” she said. “With Dan I was rushing to live. Maybe somehow he felt …” she trails off. “I don’t know, it’s just a weird feeling that I had because we were running against the clock to do everything so fast.
“When everything happened, I was like, we really didn’t have time. I think we lived a lot in a very short period. Despite only being 27, he lived more than some people who die at 90.”
An IT engineer at NBCUniversal and avid traveller, Elkayam was born and raised in Le Bourget in Paris, where his family still resides.
Troyano said football was the way he connected to people.
“That’s why today is very much ‘Dan’ – you have people of all colours and religions. One of the meanings of this event is to bring all kinds of people together. In the environment where Dan grew up, he used to say ‘football saves’. He was travelling the world, he had a master’s degree, he was an engineer, he was playing football, making friends.
“This would be his dream I think, to have people playing football and talking about him, not about what happened.”

‘Worse than lockouts’: Outcry over police plan to crack down on Sydney hotspot

‘Worse than lockouts’: Outcry over police plan to crack down on Sydney hotspot
Police are pushing to introduce facial recognition cameras, alcohol restrictions and dance floor limits on a popular pub in Sydney’s inner west, in a proposed crackdown that local councillors have blasted as heavy-handed and at odds with the city’s night-life resurgence.
Weeks after the Minns government ditched the last of Sydney’s infamous lockout laws, NSW Police are proposing tougher conditions for The Marlborough Hotel on King Street in Newtown, citing dozens of reports of alcohol-related incidents in the past few years.
City of Sydney deputy mayor Jess Miller, who will oppose the changes with the support of most councillors at a meeting on Monday, said the proposed rules were “worse than the lockouts”.
“This signifies a major step backwards in reviving the 24-hour economy and undermines the work of the City and the state to balance vibrancy and safety in a way that is reasonable,” Miller said.
The state government’s “vibrancy” reforms have aimed to resurrect Sydney’s night-life by slashing restrictions on live music, hospitality and entertainment at NSW venues.
The Marlborough, also known as The Marly, has operated since 1860 and is owned by hospitality group Solotel. As many as 1500 patrons can pass through on a busy night.
Police from the Inner West local area command wrote to the NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority in September, requesting changes to the hotel’s liquor licence due to “ongoing compliance issues” that they said had caused a “significant risk to public safety”.
The submission said there had been more than 90 reported incidents of assault, offensive behaviour, sexual touching, drink-spiking, sexual assault and resisting, hindering or assaulting police, at or near the pub, by patrons or revellers who had recently left the venue, in the past five years.
Police acknowledged that the venue had introduced measures – including body-worn cameras for some security staff, and shifting the main entrance – to improve safety and compliance, but they were concerned this “has had minimal impact on reducing the frequency of alcohol-related incidents”.
They are seeking to impose conditions including a facial recognition system that would operate daily across the venue after 9pm; uniformed security guards monitoring the dance floor and beer garden after 10pm; extra RSA (responsible service of alcohol) marshals; alcohol restrictions after midnight; and limiting capacity on the venue’s dance floors to one person per square-metre.
Solotel was contacted for comment.
A draft submission from City of Sydney councillors opposing the changes suggested the figures police used in the submission were “misleading”, and the licensee’s own analysis showed 40 of the 93 reported incidents were withdrawn, or the matters did not proceed.
The submission said the analysis showed that the number of police-reported incidents at the venue had fallen from 25 matters in 2023 to seven incidents in 2025, a 72 per cent drop in two years. Staff at the hotel had also refused entry to more than 1800 hopeful patrons in the year to August 2025.
Miller said: “The number of incidents that the police have highlighted alone does not reflect the proactive measures that the venue takes in preventing and managing the patrons.
“It also does not take into account the size of the venue, the key location on King Street or the fact that it is usually the latest trading venue in the precinct with entertainment and dancing.”
The draft submission urged the authority to reject the conditions in their current form, arguing that the Marlborough was a cultural institution they considered to be a “safe, well-managed venue”.
It said that requiring facial recognition technology represented an “extraordinary intrusion into personal privacy” which would have a “chilling effect on patronage and cultural participation”. It also argued that the “cumulative impact of the proposed conditions would render the hotel commercially unviable for late-night entertainment”.
“The proposed conditions [are] disproportionate, privacy-invasive, and directly contrary to the NSW government’s clearly stated policy direction toward targeted, risk-based regulation and a thriving 24-hour economy,” the draft submission said. Councillors will debate the matter on Monday night.
Music and Night-time Economy Minister John Graham said he hoped all the parties could reach a solution to the matters that balanced “safety, vibrancy and cost to the business”.
“Any progress we make unlocking the night-time economy cannot come at the expense of safety,” he said.
“Compared to the lockout era, we have less of a blanket approach and better processes for resolving issues at individual venues.”
The liquor authority will consider the submissions before deciding on any changes to conditions.
Liberal councillor Lyndon Gannon said: “Policing is a hard enough job, but no one is suggesting our collective ambition for Sydney is to go back to pre-lockout law days. That’s not going to happen.”

Even after Supreme Court ruling, Trump insists he can do as he wishes
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump’s furious response on Feb 20 to the Supreme Court’s tariffs decision underscored his insistence that he should be granted expansive powers to carry out his agenda as he wishes.
Lashing out after the court decided that he had exceeded his authority in imposing an array of tariffs
“I’m ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” the president said. He suggested that Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom he nominated during his first term, were “an embarrassment to their families”
The Trump administration has consistently criticised and sometimes defied lower court rulings that it does not like. Mr Trump’s bitingly personal attacks on the highest court in the land on Feb 20 appeared intended to undercut the authority of the justices to rein him in and highlighted his lack of deference to the constitutional separation of powers.
At the same time, Mr Trump gave no indication that he would defy the court’s ruling, pivoting quickly to impose new tariffs using other, more constrained, mechanisms that are still available to him.
He said one set of trade powers, known as Section 122, would be used to impose an across-the-board 10 per cent tariff, starting on Feb 24. And he said he would use another set of powers, Section 301, to open investigations into unfair trade practices, which could yield additional tariffs.
The president’s remarks on Feb 20 were revealing about how he views Supreme Court justices, not as independent legal thinkers appointed for their expertise or as a constitutional check on his administration, but as appointees who should be loyal to him.
Until now, the court had been remarkably deferential to him, repeatedly allowing policies that have been challenged in court to go into effect while litigation proceeds. Feb 20 was the first time the court has issued a final ruling on the legality of a piece of Mr Trump’s agenda.
“Before the entire world, it was the president’s most spectacular display yet of his utter disrespect for the Constitution and his contempt for the Supreme Court of the United States,” conservative retired federal appeals court judge J. Michael Luttig said in an interview.
And while the president ripped into the justices who opposed him, he lavished praise on those who sided with his administration.
“I’m so proud of him,” Mr Trump said of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whom he referred to as a “genius”.
Mr Trump said the three justices who ruled in his favour were “happily invited” to his State of the Union address next week.
The others?
“They’re barely invited,” he said. “Honestly, I couldn’t care less if they come.”
He said members of the court who were appointed by Democratic presidents were reflexively against him.
“I can assure you, the Democrats on the court are thrilled, but they will automatically vote no,” Mr Trump said of the justices who ruled against him.“They also are a frankly, a disgrace to our nation, those justices. They’re an automatic no, no matter how good a case you have. No, you can’t knock their loyalty. It’s one thing you can do with some of our people.”
But Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, in particular, seemed to get under his skin.
In his concurring opinion, Justice Gorsuch wrote that Mr Trump had illegally gone around Congress in ordering his sweeping tariffs. He said the legislative process is a “bulwark of liberty” and warned that if Mr Trump subverts the constitutional process, a Democratic president could be justified in doing the same.
“They’re just being fools and lap dogs” for political opponents, Mr Trump said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution. It’s my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think.”
Later, of Justices Gorsuch and Barrett, he said: “I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, the two of them.”
Mr Trump said he had tried mightily not to offend the justices before the ruling.
“I wanted to be very well behaved, because I didn’t want to do anything that would affect the decision of the court,” the president said. “Because I understand the court. I understand how they’re very easily swayed. I want to be a good boy.”
Legal experts said Mr Trump’s broadside against the court was remarkable.
“In my professional career, I don’t remember any president attacking judges in quite so personal way,” said retired federal judge Jeremy Fogel, who is also a former executive director of the Federal Judicial Center. “Presidents of both parties have been unhappy with major decisions. That’s not unusual and sometimes they’ll express pretty extreme disappointment about what the court did, but the name-calling in my experience is unprecedented.”
And even though Mr Trump gave no indication that he would defy the court, his rhetoric was damaging nonetheless, legal experts said.
“The larger problem is that in the long term, the more that government actors – and the president’s obviously the most visible one – are stirring up public clamor over the legitimacy of the court, the more that has the effect of potentially weakening the court,” said Dr Stephen I. Vladeck, a Georgetown University law professor. NYTIMES

Factory producing Iskander and Oreshnik missiles attacked at night in Udmurtia, Russia
According to Ukrinform, the ASTRA Telegram channel reported this.
According to ASTRA, which analyzed eyewitness footage, the Votkinsk Machine Building Plant was hit during the night attack. This plant manufactures Iskander-M, Topol-M, and Oreshnik missiles.
This strategic defense enterprise is subject to sanctions by the US, the UK, the EU, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, and Ukraine.
Locals in chat rooms claim that workshops No. 22 and No. 36 were damaged during the attack.
It is not specified what caused the strike. According to Ukrainian sources cited by the media outlet, the strike was not carried out by UAVs but by Flamingo missiles, though this has not yet been confirmed. The distance from Votkinsk to the border with Ukraine is almost 1,500 kilometers.
In turn, the head of the Udmurt Republic, Aleksandr Brechalov, confirmed the attack on the region, stating that the Armed Forces of Ukraine had struck “one of the facilities” of the republic. According to him, the strike was carried out by drones. A total of 11 people were injured.
There are also reports of an attack by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on “two industrial sites” in the Samara region of the Russian Federation. “Last night, the enemy struck two industrial sites in the region. There were no casualties. Emergency services are working at the sites,” said Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, governor of the region.
The media outlet notes that Ukrainian Telegram channels reported that the Neftegorsk Gas Processing Plant JSC was attacked. There is no confirmation of this information yet.
The Neftegorsk Gas Processing Plant is an industrial enterprise that processes associated petroleum gas, located in the city of Neftegorsk, Samara region. The plant plays an important role in the utilization and processing of hydrocarbon raw materials in the region and is part of the Rosneft Oil Company.
In total, the Russian Ministry of Defense reported that 77 drones were shot down overnight over eight Russian regions, the waters of the Sea of Azov, and the temporarily occupied Crimea.
As reported by Ukrinform, in the Pskov region of the Russian Federation, after a drone attack on a local oil depot on the night of February 19, a tank containing petroleum products caught fire.

“It is not bad to have a Supreme Court and, therefore, the rule of law,” he said at the annual agricultural salon in Paris, in response to a question about US Supreme Court’s ruling on Feb 20 that tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump under an economic emergency law were illegal.
“It is good to have power and counterweights to power in democracies,” Mr Macron said.
He added that France would consider the consequences of Mr Trump’s new 10 per cent global tariff
He said that a calm mindset was needed and that the fairest rule was “reciprocity” and not to “be subjected to unilateral decisions”. REUTERS

‘Leave immediately’: Residents in Australia’s Victoria state urged to flee out-of-control bushfire
Police are investigating if the bushfire was deliberately lit

Residents in Australia’s Victoria state were told to flee on Saturday after an out-of-control bushfire tore through steep, forested country.
The blaze began on Thursday night near Gaffneys Creek, located about 50 km northeast of state capital Melbourne.
Victorian emergency services issued the state’s highest alert for residents around the A1 Mine Settlement after the fire moved rapidly along ridgelines, leading to road closures.
“Leaving immediately is the safest option, before conditions become too dangerous,” Victoria Emergency said on its website.
State response controller Alistair Drayton told ABC News that the bushfire was burning in “remote mountainous terrain which is difficult for crews to access from the ground”.
Firefighters had managed to contain the fire’s western edge, but they were still working round-the-clock to bring it under control.
“The fire is burning in complex and steep terrain, with crews working around the clock. They are using heavy machinery to build containment lines on the ground and aircraft to directly attack the blaze,” officials said, according to Sky News.
Police are also investigating whether the bushfire was deliberately lit. A local volunteer told ABC News that crews who initially responded believed it may have been deliberately ignited after they found three separate ignition points.
Victoria Police said detectives from the Benalla Crime Investigation Unit were leading the inquiry. “While the cause of the blaze remains under investigation, the fire is being treated as suspicious until known otherwise,” police said.
About 35 vehicles were responding to the blaze, which authorities said had burnt through more than 600 hectares.
Drayton also flagged that weather expectations added to the urgency of the warning. “There is a significant amount of rain coming across Victoria [tomorrow] which is very welcome but the way in which it will be coming, unfortunately, with thunderstorms, people do need to be quite cautious in relation to their travel,” he told the outlet.
Authorities have said that temperatures across Victoria are set to hit 38C in the north, 32C in the south, and high 20s near the coast on Saturday. Sunday will see “gusty winds and moderate to locally heavy rainfall,” which has a danger of fanning the fire and flash flooding respectively.
Daryl Bashmore, owner of the Kevington Hotel and a volunteer firefighter, said that the fire’s direction was a concern, even if it wasn’t moving too quickly.
“It just depends if that wind does pick up and pushes it further this way or turns around,” he said.
Victoria Emergency said that three other active fires in the state were at the “Watch and Act” level, the second-highest alert tier used when conditions remain dangerous but immediate evacuation is not yet ordered.
This bushfire follows a severe outbreak in January, when thousands of firefighters were mobilised across south-eastern Australia to combat dozens of blazes that collectively razed homes, cut power to large numbers of properties, and charred vast tracts of bushland. They were the worst fires to hit the southeast since the Black Summer blazes of 2019-2020 that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.

Russia injures at least 15 in missile and drone attacks across Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson
Russia injured at least fifteen people in overnight and morning attacks across Ukraine after launching missiles and drones at civilian targets, as peace talks between the two sides go nowhere.
The main target was Odesa Oblast, where two people were injured after drones tore into houses and a four-storey apartment block, the emergency services reported on Feb. 21. The attack also damaged energy infrastructure and a warehouse, as well as the second floor of a school.
The press service for DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy firm, told the Kyiv Independent that the strike hit one of their substations. The damage is "significant," and repairs will take a "long time," the company wrote on social media.
The relentless attacks have left parts of Odesa without heating, water, and electricity. Over 16,000 locals have used assistance points set up by the emergency services to warm up and charge devices.
Closer to the frontline, Russian troops launched a series of strikes on Zaporizhzhia city and the surrounding area, injuring seven overnight, Ivan Fedorov, head of the regional administration, reported.
Another airstrike on Sumy, near the Russian border, injured two children and an elderly woman with the explosion destroying two buildings and damaging ten houses, the Sumy Oblast police reported. The victims are receiving medical care, the police noted.
In Kherson, a stone's throw away from the frontline, Russian troops targeted a civilian minibus with a drone, injuring at least three people, including the 71-year-old driver, on the morning of Feb. 21, the region’s state administration reported.
In total, Russia launched a ballistic missile and 120 drones overnight, targeting 19 locations, Ukraine’s air force reported. Ukraine managed to fend off 106 drones, but the remainder hit their targets.
Despite Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. engaging in peace talk negotiations in Geneva earlier this week, Russia continued to wage terror across the country nonstop.
The talks ended without any guarantees on Feb. 18, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying he was dissatisfied with the outcome.

Utah’s Supreme Court rejects appeal to overturn congressional map with Democratic-leaning district

Utah’s Supreme Court rejects appeal to overturn congressional map with Democratic-leaning district
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah’s Supreme Court rejected on Friday an appeal by Republican lawmakers and left in place a congressional map that gives Democrats a high chance of picking up one of the state’s four Republican-held U.S. House seats in the fall.
In the order signed by Chief Justice Matthew B. Durrant, the court explained that they do not have “jurisdiction over Legislative Defendants’ appeal.”
The lawmakers had appealed a decision in November in which a Utah judge adopted a congressional map creating a Democratic-leaning district over one poised to protect all four of the state’s U.S. House seats held by Republicans.
The map keeps Salt Lake County almost entirely within one district, instead of dividing the heavily Democratic population center among all four districts, as was previously the case.
Republicans have argued the court does not have legal authority to enact a map that wasn’t approved by the Legislature.
Utah’s Republican Senate President Stuart Adams pushed back on the ruling, saying the “chaos continues.”
“We will keep defending a process that respects the Constitution and ensures Utah voters across our state have their voices respected,” he said in a statement.
Katharine Biele, president of the League of Women Voters of Utah, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, applauded the ruling.
“We are encouraged that the court dismissed this improper appeal and allowed the process to move forward without disruption to voters or election administrators,” she said in a statement.
The redistricting stems from an August decision in which Judge Dianna Gibson struck down the Utah congressional map adopted after the 2020 census because the Legislature had circumvented anti-gerrymandering standards passed by voters.
The ruling pushed the state into a national redistricting battle as President Donald Trump urged Republican-led states to take up mid-decade redistricting to try to help the GOP retain control of the House in 2026.
The approved map gives Democrats a much stronger chance to flip a seat in a state that last had a Democrat in Congress in early 2021.
Emma Petty Addams, co-executive director of Mormon Women for Ethical Government, another plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement Friday that “the courts have provided an important check on the Legislature, affirming the people’s constitutional right to alter and reform their government.”
The ruling comes weeks before the deadline to file for reelection.
There is another appeal pending in federal court that was spearheaded by two of the state’s Republican members of Congress. The lawsuit filed in February argues the state judge violated the U.S. Constitution by rejecting the congressional districts drawn by the Republican-led state Legislature.

The bishop of Lincoln has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault, according to police.
Lincolnshire police confirmed that a 68-year-old man was arrested as part of an “ongoing investigation following an allegation that a man was sexually assaulted between 2018 and 2025”.
This comes after The Church of England said the Right Rev Stephen Conway was suspended from ministry while a “safeguarding complaint” was being investigated. The bishop has been released on conditional bail, and the Guardian has attempted to reach him for a comment.
Earlier, the diocese of Lincoln confirmed that the bishop had been suspended from his duties. It said in a statement: “The bishop of Lincoln, the Right Rev Stephen Conway, has been suspended from ministry while a complaint made to the national safeguarding team is responded to according to House of Bishops code of practice. This includes referral to the appropriate statutory authorities.”
No details of the complaint were given.
According to the statement, while proceedings take place the bishop of Grantham, the Right Rev Dr Nicholas Chamberlain, will take over diocesan duties during the suspension.
The diocese added: “Support is in place for those affected and there will be no further comment while the process is ongoing. We understand that this will be a deeply unsettling time. The diocesan safeguarding team is available for anyone who wishes to contact them.”
Conway was installed as bishop of Lincoln in 2023, previously having served as bishop of Ramsbury and bishop of Ely. He has been a member of the House of Lords since 2014.

Trump imposes 10 pct global tariff after stinging court rebuke

President Donald Trump imposed Friday an additional 10 percent tariff on imports into the United States after the Supreme Court struck down many of his sweeping and often arbitrary duties, delivering a stinging rebuke on his signature economic policy.
Trump signed the tariff order in the Oval Office — saying on social media it was "effective almost immediately" — after spending the past year imposing various rates to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.
The new duty is slated to take effect February 24 for 150 days, with exemptions remaining for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the U.S. under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, according to a White House factsheet.
U.S. trading partners that reached tariff deals with Trump's administration will now also face a 10 percent duty, despite higher levels they may have agreed on previously, the White House said.
But a White House official told AFP that the Trump administration would seek ways to "implement more appropriate or pre-negotiated tariff rates" down the line.
Earlier Friday, the conservative-majority high court ruled six to three that a 1977 law Trump has relied on to slap sudden rates on individual countries, upending global trade, "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."
Trump, who had nominated two of the justices who repudiated him, responded furiously, alleging without evidence that the court was influenced by foreign interests.
"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump told reporters.
"In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past," Trump said, insisting that the ruling left him "more powerful."
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, addressing the Economic Club of Dallas, said the alternative method "will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026."
Major setback
The ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel, aluminum and various other goods. Government probes still underway could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.
Still, it marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House 13 months ago. The court has generally expanded his power.
The justices ruled Friday that "had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs" through the 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, "it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes."
"IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties," Chief Justice John Roberts said in his opinion.
Wall Street saw share prices rise modestly after the decision, which had been expected.
Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.
The Trump administration in court arguments said companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the ruling did not address the issue.
Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the one Trump nominee to side with him, noted the refund process could be a "mess."
The University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model projected that the court decision on tariffs would generate up to $175 billion in refunds.
California Governor Gavin Newsom, who is widely expected to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028, said Americans deserved refunds from the "illegal cash grab."
"Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately - with interest. Cough up!"
But Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, cautioned that there remained "no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid."
The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates consumers face an average effective tariff rate of 9.1 percent with Friday's decision, down from 16.9 percent.
The rate "remains the highest since 1946," excluding 2025, it said.
Close U.S. trading partners including the European Union and Britain said they were studying the decision.
Canada, which has faced repeated tariff threats as Trump questioned the sovereignty of the northern neighbor, said the Supreme Court showed the levies were "unjustified," but the country braced for more turbulence.
"Canada should prepare for new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects," said Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.

Why the world no longer sees the US as a reliable partner?

In past decades, the United States consistently sought to portray itself as the architect and guarantor of a “rules-based order”; an order that took shape after World War II around institutions such as the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. For years, Washington used this position to consolidate its global influence and build its international legitimacy on the basis of defending shared rules. However, what has unfolded in recent years—especially during the presidency of Donald Trump—indicates that a deep gap has emerged between claim and practice; a gap that, if not repaired, could accelerate America’s decline.
One of the most prominent manifestations of this gap has been a return to policies that, rather than evoking modern diplomacy, recall the logic of the “law of the jungle”; a logic in which power replaces rules and pressure becomes the primary tool of interaction with others. Trump came to power with the slogan “America First,” but in practice, this slogan translated into an approach that did not spare even Washington’s closest allies from threats and sanctions.
The imposition of heavy tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Europe, Canada, and even Japan was a clear example of this behavior. Countries that for decades had partnered with the United States in Western security and economic structures suddenly received the message that even strategic relations would not shield them from punitive measures. When Washington, citing “national security,” imposes tariffs on the products of its own allies, the question arises in their minds as to how expansively America’s national security can be interpreted. Such actions not only created economic rifts but also eroded political trust.
The episode of the proposal to purchase Greenland from Denmark likewise became a symbol of an instrumental and transactional view of international relations. Proposing such an idea—concerning a territory that is part of an allied NATO member state—reminded many observers of the colonial era, when major powers traded territories like commodities. The negative reaction in Copenhagen and among European public opinion showed that today’s world no longer accepts such language. But the more important message was that even America’s closest partners may be exposed to unexpected and humiliating decisions.
Moreover, Trump’s approach to resolving international disputes was often based on maximum pressure and threats of the use of force. From verbal threats against various countries to unilateral withdrawals from multilateral agreements, all of these reinforced the perception that Washington relies more on coercive instruments than on legal and diplomatic mechanisms. Withdrawal from international agreements and the reimposition of sweeping sanctions sent a signal to the world that America’s signature could become invalid with a change of administration. Under such circumstances, what incentive remains for long-term trust in Washington’s commitments?
Economic sanctions also shifted from being an exceptional tool to a permanent policy. The scope of these sanctions expanded to such an extent that not only target countries, but also third-party companies and banks were exposed to punishment. These extraterritorial sanctions effectively disregard the sovereignty of other states and compel them to align their policies with domestic decisions of the United States. The natural result of such an approach is an effort to reduce dependence on the dollar-dominated financial system—an effort that has accelerated in recent years.
Within this framework, emerging powers and even some traditional US allies have moved toward strengthening independent mechanisms. The expanding role of groups such as BRICS can be seen as part of this trend; an attempt to create balance against Western financial and political dominance. The more the United States resorts to instruments of pressure, the greater the incentive for others to converge within alternative frameworks.
Trump’s harsh and at times absurd behavior toward allies has also had significant psychological consequences. European leaders have explicitly spoken of the necessity of “strategic autonomy.” In Asia as well, countries—while maintaining security relations with the United States—are seeking to deepen economic ties with China so as not to remain vulnerable in the event of sudden shifts in Washington’s policies. This growing caution indicates that America is no longer viewed as a stable and predictable partner.
From a historical perspective, the decline of great powers often begins when the gap between their claims and their conduct becomes excessive. The United States still occupies a distinguished position in military and technological terms, but hard power without moral legitimacy and international trust is not sustainable. If a country claims to defend international law but in practice applies rules selectively or treats its allies as commercial rivals, this contradiction will sooner or later lead to a reduction in influence.
The global economy has also responded to the instability of US policies. Major companies are reviewing their supply chains to reduce the risks of sanctions and sudden tariffs. Countries are seeking to diversify their foreign exchange reserves and create independent payment systems. These trends may be gradual, but taken together, they lead to a gradual erosion of America’s leverage.
The continued reliance on force or threats to resolve issues will not be effective in a world moving toward multipolarity. The more Washington relies on the logic of imposition, the more others will turn to balancing strategies. In such an environment, the United States may find itself facing a world that distances itself from it not out of hostility, but out of distrust.
Ultimately, the greatest threat to America’s position is not the rise of others, but its own strategic choices. If behaviors reminiscent of the law of the jungle continue, if allies are treated as competitors, and if international rules are respected only when aligned with Washington’s short-term interests, the process of decline will accelerate. Today’s world is more interconnected than ever, and power no longer derives solely from the barrel of a gun or the size of an economy; it flows from trust, stability, and adherence to commitments. A country that loses this capital—even if it is the most powerful—will sooner or later lose its position in the international system.

Avalanches kill five in Austrian Alps, officials say
Five people were killed in a series of avalanches in the Austrian Alps as heavy snowfall hit the region on Friday.
A 42-year-old German man, caught in an avalanche with his 16-year-old son, was among the victims, police said. The teenager was airlifted to hospital from the slope in Nauders near the Swiss-Italian border.
Three other skiers were killed in an avalanche near the popular St Anton resort, while a snowboarder died after being buried in the neighbouring Vorarlberg region.
Austria has now seen at least 21 avalanche-related deaths this winter, while dozens of fatalities have been recorded across the Alps.
The avalanche risk remains high in parts of Tyrol - meaning avalanches can be expected - where two fatal avalanches occurred on Friday in off-piste areas.
Police told Austrian media the avalanche near St Anton am Arlberg, which killed three men, appeared to have been triggered by the skiers themselves.
Two were American and Polish nationals, public broadcaster ORF reported, while the third was a 21-year-old Austrian who died in hospital.
Two other men were recovered from the scene with injuries after a major operation involving four mountain rescue teams, three helicopters, as well as emergency services.
Elsewhere, a 53-year-old man died after being crushed by a snow plough in the northern city of Linz.
The vehicle slid down a set of stairs where the man had been clearing snow, ORF reported. He died at the scene.
The significant snowfall in the region also caused power outages and transport chaos on Friday, particularly in the south-east.
The Red Cross was deployed to help those stuck in traffic jams in the state of Styria, where a motoring organisation described the roads as "virtually inaccessible to private vehicles".
Vienna International Airport temporarily closed in the morning, and afternoon services were "disrupted".
The avalanche death toll in the Alps has been higher than usual this year, and includes three Britons killed in France's La Grave earlier this month.

The Bishop of Lincoln has been arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. Lincolnshire Police said that a 68-year-old man was arrested as part of an “ongoing investigation following an allegation that a man was sexually assaulted between 2018 and 2025”.
The Rt Rev Stephen Conway has been released on conditional bail. Earlier, the Diocese of Lincoln confirmed that the Bishop had been suspended from his duties.
It said in a statement: “The Bishop of Lincoln, the Right Rev Stephen Conway, has been suspended from ministry while a complaint made to the National Safeguarding Team is responded to according to House of Bishops Code of Practice. This includes referral to the appropriate statutory authorities.”
The Diocese did not give any details of the complaint. The Bishop of Grantham, the Rt Rev Dr Nicholas Chamberlain, would take over diocesan duties during the suspension, the statement said.
The Diocese added: “Support is in place for those affected and there will be no further comment while the process is ongoing. We understand that this will be a deeply unsettling time. The Diocesan Safeguarding Team is available for anyone who wishes to contact them.”
Rt Rev Conway was installed as Bishop of Lincoln in 2023, having previously served as Bishop of Ramsbury and Bishop of Ely. He has been a member of the House of Lords since 2014.

Russians try to strengthen communications for controlling drones in Myrnohrad
According to Ukrinform, the 79th Air Assault Brigade Tavria reported this on Telegram.
“The occupiers are focusing their efforts on taking the positions of the Tavria paratroopers in the ‘clamp, ’” the report says.
At the same time, the Russians are continuing their attempts to push Ukrainian defenders out of the northern part of Myrnohrad and its surroundings.
"The enemy is not changing its approach to combat operations, using small group tactics. In some places, the occupiers are trying to use small vehicles, such as motorcycles and buggies, to advance deep into the defense line quickly. In reality, there has been no clear front line for a long time," the military said.
In the central part of Myrnohrad, the Russians are trying to install as many antennas and signal amplifiers as possible to strengthen their unmanned aerial vehicles.
The 79th Air Assault Brigade Tavria emphasized that, despite the enemy's numerical superiority in manpower and equipment, the paratroopers continue to eliminate Russian invaders and carry out their missions.
As reported by Ukrinform, 175 combat clashes between the Ukrainian Defense Forces and Russian invaders were recorded on the front line over the past day.

IDF says it killed numerous Hezbollah terrorists accelerating missile launch plans in Baalbek

The Israel Defense Forces confirmed Saturday morning reports from Lebanon of fatalities in strikes carried out deep inside the country, in the Baalbek area, saying it killed “a large number” of terrorists belonging to Hezbollah’s missile array in three separate command centers.
Lebanese media reported at least 10 people were killed in the Baalbek strikes, of whom six were allegedly Hezbollah members.
“The terrorists were recently identified operating to accelerate processes of preparedness and force buildup, while planning fire toward the State of Israel and advancing terror attack frameworks that endanger IDF troops and Israeli civilians,” the military said in a statement.
“Hezbollah’s missile array is responsible for the launch of missiles and rockets toward the State of Israel and is currently engaged in planning such fire toward our territory,” the statement added.
The strikes come amid concerns that Hezbollah could join Iran in attacking Israel if the United States strikes the Iranian regime.
Military correspondent Yossi Yehoshua reported that the IDF has already prepared a plan to significantly damage Hezbollah in response to the group’s rehabilitation efforts over the past year. At the same time, Israel’s defensive capabilities against Hezbollah’s missiles and rockets are described as strong, with proven and improving interception rates. In the next confrontation, the laser defense system is expected to be fully operational, a factor Israeli officials say should deter Hezbollah from entering another round of fighting.
Israel has also formulated an offensive plan against the group and continues to strike targets in Lebanon on a regular basis. However, Hezbollah’s rate of recovery has been described as faster than the IDF’s ongoing efforts to degrade its capabilities.
Following the Baalbek strike, the IDF said the terrorists’ activity constituted a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.
“The IDF will continue to act against attempts by the Hezbollah terrorist organization to rehabilitate and rearm, and will operate with force to remove any threat to Israeli civilians,” the statement said. “The IDF remains committed to the understandings between Israel and Lebanon.”
According to Lebanese reports, at least 10 people were killed in the Baalbek area and dozens were wounded. One report said three Hezbollah commanders were among the dead: Ali Zeid al-Moussawi, Muhammad Ibrahim al-Moussawi and Hussein Yaghi.
Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar reported that Hussein Yaghi was the son of former Hezbollah parliament member Muhammad Hassan Yaghi, considered one of the founders of the terrorist organization and a former aide to Hassan Nasrallah. In an obituary published by Hezbollah-affiliated media, Yaghi was described as a “jihad commander” who was killed “defending Lebanon and the people.”
In addition to the strikes in the Bekaa Valley, the IDF carried out another strike in Lebanon on Friday, targeting a command center where Hamas terrorists were operating in the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near Sidon in southern Lebanon.
According to the IDF, the command center had recently been used to prepare terror attacks against IDF forces in Lebanon and to conduct training aimed at advancing various attack plans against Israeli forces and the State of Israel. In an unusual move, the strike was carried out by a Navy missile boat.
Lebanese reports said three people were killed in that strike and 12 were wounded.

Australian sprinting sensation Gout Gout has come perilously close to breaking the 10-second barrier, with another eye-catching run in Brisbane.
The Queenslander ran a 10.00 (+0.9m/s) on Saturday at the Dane Bird-Smith Shield Meet at the Queensland State Athletic Centre.
Gout's time set a new Australian under-20s record for the men's 100m, beating Jake Doran's 10.15, which has stood since 2018.
The 18-year-old unofficially broke the 10-second barrier twice in one day last April, but neither time was listed as a personal best due to wind assistance.
Gout has opted not to compete in this year's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, instead choosing to prioritise the World Athletics Under 20 Championships.
His run in Brisbane on Saturday was his first qualifying performance for this year's championships.
The 10-second barrier has only been broken by two Australians.
Patrick Johnson ran a 9.93 in 2003, which remains an Australian record.
Last year, Lachlan Kennedy ran a 9.98 at a meet in Kenya.

Suspect with loaded gun in rucksack runs into crowded nightclub
London police who stopped a man on suspicion of drink-driving found that he was armed with a loaded gun in his rucksack after he tried to flee through a crowded nightclub.
Nathan Ingram, 29, of Ridley Road in Hackney, east London, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment at Wood Green Crown Court, having previously pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm, ammunition, and possession of a class A drug, Scotland Yard said.
Footage shows police chasing Ingram into the club and the moment an officer discovers the firearm - a loaded Bernardelli 69 self-loading pistol.
The bag also contained a small amount of cocaine.
Police said Ingram was sentenced on 27 January.

Sweden to introduce cellphone air raid alert system

Sweden currently has an outdoor alarm system consisting of around 4,500 horns on rooftops and other tall buildings throughout the country.
"Based on the experiences we've seen in Ukraine, we've seen that the enemy, in this case Russia, would shoot down our outdoor warning system," Henrik Larsson, head of the population protection department at the Swedish Civil Defence and Resilience Agency, told AFP.
"So this would complement that," he said of the new system, dubbed SE Alert.
In the event of an air raid, cellphones connected to the Swedish telecoms network would automatically emit voice message warnings, sirens and begin vibrating, he said.
The system, to be rolled out within six months, could also be used to send alerts in case of major crises during peacetime, such as nuclear or chemical accidents.
Larsson said the agency was also working with the Swedish armed forces to develop an app that lets people easily photograph airborne drones and report them to authorities.
Sweden has been beefing up its civil preparedness and so-called "total defence" measures since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The idea is to mobilise all of society, from authorities to citizens and businesses, to collectively resist armed aggression while maintaining essential functions.

Russian intelligence accuses Telegram of providing information to Ukrainian intelligence, military
FSB says use of Telegram by Russian servicemen in combat zone over past 3 months led to threats to their lives
MOSCOW
The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) on Saturday accused Telegram of providing information to Ukraine’s military and intelligence.
The FSB claimed in a statement that it has evidence that Ukraine’s intelligence had access to communications of the Russian military and used it against them.
"The Federal Security Service has reliable data indicating that the armed forces and special services of Ukraine are capable of quickly obtaining information posted on the Telegram messenger and using it for military purposes," the statement read.
The FSB further said that the use of Telegram by Russian servicemen in the area of the combat zone over the past three months has led to threats to their lives.
"As a result of analyzing the work of the Telegram messenger, numerous reliable data were obtained showing that its use by servicemen of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in the area of the special military operation during the last three months repeatedly resulted in creating life-threatening situations for soldiers," it said.
The Russian authorities started slowing down the work of Telegram in December. In early February, they shortly limited access to the app on Russia’s territory, but following many complaints from the military, lifted restrictions.
Since 2019, Russia banned access to several social media platforms and apps on its territory, including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and WhatsApp.

South Korea protests US over jet standoff with China

South Korea protested with the US Forces Korea early this week over its rare standoff with Chinese fighter jets during a training aircraft drill over the Yellow Sea, local media reported on Saturday.
Defence Minister Ahn Gyu-back lodged the complaint in a call with Gen. Xavier Brunson, the commander of the Combined Forces Command and the US Forces Korea, immediately after he received a report of the incident on Wednesday, the Seoul-based Yonhap News reported, citing unnamed military sources.
South Korea's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Jin Young-sung, also lodged a complaint in a call with Gen. Brunson.
US and Chinese fighter jets engaged in a brief standoff over the Yellow Sea on Wednesday during an air exercise of the US Air Force, which involved 10 F-16 fighter jets.
The F-16 jets reportedly flew to an area between the respective air defence identification zones of South Korea and China.
The move prompted the Chinese military to dispatch its own fighter jets to the scene, but no clash occurred.
The US Forces Korea, a subordinate unified command of the US Indo-Pacific Command, had informed Seoul's military of its plan ahead of the training operation but apparently did not elaborate on the details, including the purpose of the drills, according to the South Korean officials.
South Korea is one of the US’s oldest and closest allies, hosting around 28,500 American soldiers on the Korean Peninsula under a mutual defence treaty between Washington and Seoul.

Macron urges 'calm' ahead of march for slain far-right activist

French President Emmanuel Macron appealed on Saturday, February 21, for cooler heads to prevail ahead of a march for a far-right activist whose killing, blamed on the hard left, has put the country on edge. Macron also said his government would hold a meeting to discuss "violent action groups" in the wake of the fatal beating of Quentin Deranque, which has ignited tensions between the left and right ahead of the 2027 presidential vote.
The 23-year-old died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing La France Insoumise (LFI) party in Lyon last week.
Speaking at a farming trade fair in Paris, Macron urged "everyone to remain" calm ahead of the rally for Deranque in Lyon, which is set to go ahead under high security later on Saturday despite Lyon's left-wing Green mayor asking the state to ban it.
"In the Republic, no violence is legitimate," said Macron, who will be unable to contest next year's presidential election after hitting the two-term limit. "There is no place for militias, no matter where they come from."
The rally is expected to be attended by 2,000 to 3,000 people, and likely to see counter-protesters from the hard left.
'Wound'
Having urged both the far right and hard left to clean up their acts, the president said his administration would hold a meeting next week "take stock of violent action groups which are active and have links with political parties of any description."
Deranque's death has provoked a reaction from US President Donald Trump's administration, with State Department official Sarah Rogers on Friday branding the killing "terrorism" and claiming that "violent radical leftism is on the rise."
Likewise, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday called Deranque's death "a wound for all Europe," prompting Macron to urge the far-right leader to stay out of French matters.
Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to a radical left-wing MP has also been charged with complicity.
A far-right group called Némésis, which claims to "defend Western women" from the violence allegedly wrought by immigrants, said Deranque had been at the protest in Lyon to protect its members when he was assaulted by "anti-fascist" activists.

Live: More than 3000 march in Lyon for slain far-right activist Quentin Deranque
Around 3,200 people on Saturday participated in tribute rally in Lyon for slain far-right activist Quentin Deranque, who was fatally beaten in a street brawl between ultranationalist and anti-fascist militants, according to the Rhône prefecture. French President Emmanuel Macron earlier earlier called for calm at the rally, where authorities have deployed a large police presence amid security concerns.

Rally arrives at Rue Victor Lagrange, paying tribute to Quentin Deranque at the spot where he was killed
Demanstrators reached the end of their route, on rue Victor Lagrange, in the 7th arrondissement of Lyon, where the young far-right activist Quentin Deranque was fatally beaten.
The crowd paid tribute to him, some protesters lit torches and stood in silence before a banner that read "Farewell comrade".
'Heavy', 'sad' and 'increasingly intense' atmosphere at rally for killed far-right activist
Several hundreds joined a march organised by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
Reporting from Lyon, FRANCE 24's Olivia Bizot said the atmosphere was "heavy, sad and increasingly intense", adding that "several young men carrying wooden sticks" were present at the rally.
3,200 participants to the march in Lyon according to the Préfecture

Around 3,200 people marched in France's southeastern city of Lyon on Saturday in memory of a far-right activist whose killing has been blamed on the hard left, according to estimates by the prefecture for the region.
The rally, widely publicised online by ultra-nationalist and far-right groups, had been expected to draw thousands of people and was held under heavy security, with authorities fearing clashes with left-wing protesters.

Many political slogans chanted
“The far left kills,” “LFI accomplices, anti-fascist assassins,” and “Young guard in prison, free the city of Lyon.”

Several far-right fringe groups present at the march
The call to join the march was widely shared on social media by far-right fringe groups including the “national-revolutionary” Allobroges Bourgoin, the feminist collective Némésis, the “national-identitarian” group Audace Lyon, and the monarchist, nationalist and anti-republican movement Action française.
Before the procession set off, a tribute to Quentin Deranque was held at the traditionalist Church of Saint-Georges, where services are conducted in Latin and which the young man attended.
Hundreds march in Lyon to protest far-right activist's killing
Several hundreds joined a march organised by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of the tribute to Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers next week to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate,” he said. “There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising.”
The main tribute to Deranque took place in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Their fighting often takes the form of organised street battles in the city, sometimes involving groups of several dozen people.
Lyon’s far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque’s parents also called for calm and did not take part in the tribute, which was not banned by French authorities.

Heavy police presence at rally for killed far-right activist in Lyon
Heavy police presence is expected at a rally Saturday for a far-right activist who was killed last week in Lyon according to the French interior minister. FRANCE 24's Oliva Bizot reports.

'I don't want Lyon to be the capital of the far right,' says Mayor Grégory Doucet
"I don't want Lyon to be the capital of the far right," declared Lyon Green Party mayor Grégory Doucet on Saturday before a march in tribute to radical far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
"First and foremost, it is the city of Jean Moulin, the capital of the Resistance," he said to the press, adding that national and municipal police will ensure vigilance in his city.
Watch: France on edge ahead of far-right rally
Some two to three thousand people are expected to attend a march Saturday in Lyon for a far-right activist killed last week. With ultra-right groups expected to attend the march, tensions are high with President Emmanuel Macron urging calm. FRANCE 24's Olivia Bizot reports from Lyon.
France's radical right uses Deranque’s death to target far-left
Quentin Deranque’s death has triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming the far-left France Unbowed party and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a France Unbowed lawmaker who set up the anti-fascist group The Young Guard.
France Unbowed’s opponents accuse it of fomenting violence and tensions with its combative far-left politics.
Mélenchon has condemned the violence and insisted that his party bore no blame for the tragedy.
The France Unbowed leader stood for the presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022, but failed to advance to the decisive runoff round. He is preparing for another expected run next year, when Macron’s second and last term ends.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonise France Unbowed. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party.
The National Rally has worked for years to shed its reputation as being racist and anti-Semitic and to present itself as a bulwark of institutional credibility.
In a message to party officials before Saturday's march, Bardella urged them to avoid the nationwide rallies, where potential confrontations could reinforce the negative image it is trying to shed.
"The far left's desire for confrontation with these gatherings appears undiminished. Some organisers, undeniably linked to the ultra-right and whom we refuse to associate with... are also seeking confrontation," he wrote.
"We have paid a dignified tribute to Quentin and are fully assuming the political role that the French people - shocked and outraged by this tragedy - expect from us."
He said the killing allows the National Rally to say: "'We respect institutions. There are people who are afraid of us coming to power; they kill our supporters.'"
Rhone authorities will not tolerate 'any incidents' during the march, prefect says
The prefect of Rhone, the east-central French administrative department of which Lyon is capital, has said authorities will not tolerate “any incidents” during the rally for far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of the march, Rhone Prefect Fabienne Buccio said authorities “will not tolerate any incidents within the procession” nor “on the fringes of this march”.
Security measures, which have been stepped up for the march, include additional personnel and two drones, said Buccio which “will remain in place, including in the evening,” she added.

Gold medal up for grabs in the men's curling
We are underway in the men's curling gold medal match.
It's Great Britain vs Canada in Cortina, with this Olympics' pantomime villain, Marc Kennedy, lining up for the Canadians.
For those of you in need of a refresher, Kennedy was the athlete who responded hotly to accusations of cheating during his country's preliminary round clash with Sweden, setting in motion what is surely curling's greatest and most publicised controversy.
Canada is 1-0 up after the first end.

'It means everything': Woods honoured by flagbearer nod
Mogul skier Cooper Woods says it "means everything" to be named as one of Australia's flag bearers for the Closing Ceremony.
Woods claimed gold in the opening week of the Games, becoming Australia's seventh Winter Olympic champion and setting in motion his country's most successful Games off all-time.
"It means everything," Woods said.
"I said this yesterday, it means more than the medals, all the glory, the fame.
"This is one of the best things you can do in sport, wave the flag for your country, so super excited."
He will share the honour with silver medallist Danielle Scott, who achieved a maiden Olympic podium finish in the women's aerial skiing.
Polish speed skater recovering from nasty cut
Polish short track speed skater Kamila Sellier says she is "doing quite okay" after suffering a bad cut to her face in a crash.
Sellier appeared to be hit by a skate close to her eye in a fall during a quarter-final of the women's 1,500 metres on Saturday morning AEDT.
She needed lengthy treatment before being taken away on a stretcher from the Milano Ice Skating Arena.
A white sheet was held up when she was being treated on the ice to prevent the silent crowd from seeing the extent of her injury.
She was later admitted to hospital for further treatment.
"I know that one day I'll look at this picture and remember that I'm stronger than I ever believed," the 25-year-old posted on Instagram.
"Thank you for all your words of support, just wanted to let you know that I'm doing quite okay," she added.
In the picture she appeared to be wearing a hospital gown and did not display the side of her face where she sustained the injury.

Freeski halfpipe final rescheduled
Australia's Indra Brown will have to wait to compete for her first Olympic medal, with the final of the women's freeski halfpipe being delayed due to heavy snowfall in Livigno.
Organisers say they have been unable to "prepare the pipe in a safe and fair condition".
Originally scheduled for 5:30am AEDT, the event is now slated to take place this evening Australian time.
16-year-old Brown was the fourth best qualifier for the final, ahead of defending champion Eileen Gu.
We'll keep you updated with any further developments.
Canada beats US to snare curling bronze
Canada defeated the United States 10-7 to claim women's curling bronze, as skip Rachel Homan ended her long wait for a Games medal.
Homan punched the air and embraced teammate Tracy Fleury after her counterpart Tabitha Peterson conceded with one throw remaining.
For Canada, the bronze was their first medal in the women's event since the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Switzerland and Sweden face off for the gold on Sunday evening AEDT.

40yo Dutchman wins speed skating gold
Jorrit Bergsma of the Netherlands won the men's mass start title, securing the second Olympic gold medal of his career.
The 40-year-old joined Dane Viktor Hald Thorup in a two-man breakaway early in the final, before launching an audacious sprint with two laps to go.
The ploy paid off, with the mullet-wearing Bergsma winning his first Olympic gold since claiming the 10,000m crown at the 2014 Sochi Games.
He even had time to slow down in the final straightaway, as he celebrated his victory with the crowd cheering on.
Hald Thorup held on for silver, with Italy's Andrea Giovannini leading home the chasing pack to scoop the bronze.
Germany's bobsleigh dominance
The Germans seem to have a super strong bobsled culture. Has it always been this way? Ch 9 commentator brought up how the technology in their bobsleds is better than most other teams, but I would’ve thought that all Bobsleds would have to meet the same specifications as to avoid unfair advantages. What does this mean.
- German bobsleds
Germany's strength in bobsleigh goes back decades.
Before the German reunification in 1990, East and West were among the giants of the sport.
At recent Olympics, Germany won three of the four gold medals on offer in 2022, in addition to three silver and a bronze.
In 2018, Germany shared the two-man gold, and won the four-man and two-woman events.
Technology dominates the two and four-person events, but the monobob uses standardised sleds.
The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation's website explains this as follows:
As the only Olympic bobsleigh discipline featuring standardised sleds, monobob reduces the technical barriers, making elite competition more accessible to emerging nations and first-time participants.
Canada yet to reveal if Crosby will play final
Canada has not decided whether injured captain Sidney Crosby will play in the gold-medal game at the Olympics against the United States.
Crosby skated in practice, which was closed to reporters to maintain a shroud of secrecy around the status of the 38-year-old centre who is the most decorated player on the team with two Olympic gold medals and three Stanley Cup rings.
"Obviously we'd love to have him," Canada coach Jon Cooper said.
"He won't put himself in harm's way and he's not going to put the team in harm's way."
Crosby left the quarterfinal against Czechia with an apparent right knee injury and did not play against Finland in the semis.

'Absolute joke': Canadian freestyle skier on today's conditions
Conditions have been tough in Livigno today, with the snow really coming down.
In the men's ski cross, any athletes from Canada failed to reach the big final.
One of the country's stars, Reece Howden, couldn't hide his frustration at the event not being rescheduled.
“Honestly, the weather is ridiculous. I don’t know what the times are but it’s gotta be like 10 to 15 seconds slower. It’s a completely different course," he told Canadian Olympic broadcaster, CBC, not mincing his words.
“It’s snowing so hard and the track is dead slow. At this point I’m happy I’m not involved in this (final) race because … this is not ski cross. This is terrible.
“Olympics is supposed to be the best of the best. The peak of our sport. I’ll wait four more years because this is an absolute joke.”
Aus to be well represented in two-woman bobsleigh (up later)
If you're taking a nap between the Aussies in action, make sure to set your alarms for 5am AEDT. That's when Australia will be well represented in the two-woman bobsleigh.
The country has two teams in Bree Walker/Kiara Reddingius and Desi Johnson/Sarah Blizzard (heat three 5am, heat four 7:05am).
It's the first time Australia as fielded two 2-woman bobsleigh teams at the same Games.
After heats one and two, Walker and Reddingius finished in 10th place, while Blizzard and Johnson in 19th.
In the final heats, run three will be contested in current place order, while only the top 20 sleds will advance to the fourth and deciding heat, which will run from slowest to fastest.
France claims biathlon gold and silver
France's Océane Michelon stormed through the last lap to win gold in a spine-tingling women's mass start race, as the final biathlon event delivered a blockbuster ending in the snow.
Michelon's compatriot Julia Simon employed every ounce of her physical and mental strength over the last few hundred metres to take silver ahead of Czech Tereza Voborníková, who claimed a well-deserved bronze.
However, no-one looked more stunned than 23-year-old Michelon when she crossed the finish line to win by a margin of 6.6 seconds after a brilliant final lap in which she ground down Voborníková before obliterating her over the last kilometre.
The gold was her second of the Games after victory in the mixed relay — and she also picked up a silver in the sprint — but the victory was entirely of her own making as she staked her claim to be the next dominant name in the sport.

Bobsleigh marred by three crashes
It's been a relatively crash-free Olympics in all three sliding sports — skeleton, luge and bobsled.
That was until day 15, when the second heat of the four-man bobsleigh was marred by three crashes.
The second heat was delayed for about 20 minutes after Austrian pilot Jakob Mandlbauer lost control of his sled and crashed around the midpoint of the track.
Mandlbauer was taken off the track on a stretcher and brought by ambulance to a nearby hospital for evaluation.
There was no immediate word on the severity of his injuries. Austrian officials said he had movement in his extremities.
Also crashing were the French, driven by Romain Heinrich, and Trinidad and Tobago, whose sled is piloted by Axel Brown.
Because their sleds didn't cross the finish line, they won't be racing when the event resumes Sunday.
The three German teams hold down the provisional podium spots after the second heat.

Snow is really coming down
The athletes had their work cut out for them in the men's ski cross finals today, battling not just each other but a solid blanket of snow.
The weather is not letting up across Livigno in Italy, which could create some issues with events later today.
There have already been some events moved earlier in the Games due to the weather. We'll keep you across any updates!
Freestyle skiing men's ski cross results
🥇Simone Deromedis from Italy
🥈Federico Tomasoni from Italy
🥉Alex Fiva from Switzerland
Cooper Woods and Danielle Scott named as flag-bearers for Closing Ceremony
Olympic moguls champion Cooper Woods and aerial skiing silver medallist Danielle Scott will be Australia's flag bearers for the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony!
Woods won gold in week one of the games, becoming Australia's seventh Winter Olympic Champion in history.
Four-time Olympian Scott secured her first Olympic podium finish earlier this week, following a career high top score of 117.19 in the women's aerial skiing final.
The Closing Ceremony takes place in Verona in the early hours of Monday morning Australian time.
What are Aussies Indra Brown's chances in the halfpipe?
Does Cassie Sharpe being unable to compete in the event perhaps strengthen Indra’s chances a bit more for a medal? Don’t get me wrong, I’m obviously more concerned about her being healthy above all else. The woman is a 2 time medalist and a world champion though. She’s a very strong snowboarder.
- Anton
Australian teen freeski sensation Indra Brown may only be 16, but she's already catching the eye of some big names in her sport.
Earlier this week, the halfpipe defending champion Eileen Gu said the young Aussie was 'the real deal'.
If she has the ski of her life later in the final, she could very well be leaving Milano Cortina with a medal.
That, of course, is made easier with Canada's Cassie Sharpe out of contention after a nasty crash in the qualifications.
Sharpe, as you rightly point out Anton, is a quality freeskier. The 33-year-old is one of the sport's greats, having won gold in PyeongChang in 2018 and silver in 2022.
Results in for ski mountaineering mixed relay
Unfortunately Lara Hamilton and Phillip Bellingham of Team Australia have come in 12th out of 12.
🥇Emily Harrop and Thibault Anselmet of France
🥈Marianne Fatton and Jon Kistler of Switzerland

Technology dominates the two and four-person events, but the monobob uses standardised sleds.
The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation's website explains this as follows:
As the only Olympic bobsleigh discipline featuring standardised sleds, monobob reduces the technical barriers, making elite competition more accessible to emerging nations and first-time participants.
Canada yet to reveal if Crosby will play final
Canada has not decided whether injured captain Sidney Crosby will play in the gold-medal game at the Olympics against the United States.
Crosby skated in practice, which was closed to reporters to maintain a shroud of secrecy around the status of the 38-year-old centre who is the most decorated player on the team with two Olympic gold medals and three Stanley Cup rings.
"Obviously we'd love to have him," Canada coach Jon Cooper said.
"He won't put himself in harm's way and he's not going to put the team in harm's way."
Crosby left the quarterfinal against Czechia with an apparent right knee injury and did not play against Finland in the semis.

'Absolute joke': Canadian freestyle skier on today's conditions
Conditions have been tough in Livigno today, with the snow really coming down.
In the men's ski cross, any athletes from Canada failed to reach the big final.
One of the country's stars, Reece Howden, couldn't hide his frustration at the event not being rescheduled.
“Honestly, the weather is ridiculous. I don’t know what the times are but it’s gotta be like 10 to 15 seconds slower. It’s a completely different course," he told Canadian Olympic broadcaster, CBC, not mincing his words.
“It’s snowing so hard and the track is dead slow. At this point I’m happy I’m not involved in this (final) race because … this is not ski cross. This is terrible.
“Olympics is supposed to be the best of the best. The peak of our sport. I’ll wait four more years because this is an absolute joke.”
Aus to be well represented in two-woman bobsleigh (up later)
If you're taking a nap between the Aussies in action, make sure to set your alarms for 5am AEDT. That's when Australia will be well represented in the two-woman bobsleigh.
The country has two teams in Bree Walker/Kiara Reddingius and Desi Johnson/Sarah Blizzard (heat three 5am, heat four 7:05am).
It's the first time Australia as fielded two 2-woman bobsleigh teams at the same Games.
After heats one and two, Walker and Reddingius finished in 10th place, while Blizzard and Johnson in 19th.
In the final heats, run three will be contested in current place order, while only the top 20 sleds will advance to the fourth and deciding heat, which will run from slowest to fastest.
France claims biathlon gold and silver
France's Océane Michelon stormed through the last lap to win gold in a spine-tingling women's mass start race, as the final biathlon event delivered a blockbuster ending in the snow.
Michelon's compatriot Julia Simon employed every ounce of her physical and mental strength over the last few hundred metres to take silver ahead of Czech Tereza Voborníková, who claimed a well-deserved bronze.
However, no-one looked more stunned than 23-year-old Michelon when she crossed the finish line to win by a margin of 6.6 seconds after a brilliant final lap in which she ground down Voborníková before obliterating her over the last kilometre.
The gold was her second of the Games after victory in the mixed relay — and she also picked up a silver in the sprint — but the victory was entirely of her own making as she staked her claim to be the next dominant name in the sport.

Bobsleigh marred by three crashes
It's been a relatively crash-free Olympics in all three sliding sports — skeleton, luge and bobsled.
That was until day 15, when the second heat of the four-man bobsleigh was marred by three crashes.
The second heat was delayed for about 20 minutes after Austrian pilot Jakob Mandlbauer lost control of his sled and crashed around the midpoint of the track.
Mandlbauer was taken off the track on a stretcher and brought by ambulance to a nearby hospital for evaluation.
There was no immediate word on the severity of his injuries. Austrian officials said he had movement in his extremities.
Also crashing were the French, driven by Romain Heinrich, and Trinidad and Tobago, whose sled is piloted by Axel Brown.
Because their sleds didn't cross the finish line, they won't be racing when the event resumes Sunday.
The three German teams hold down the provisional podium spots after the second heat.

Snow is really coming down
The athletes had their work cut out for them in the men's ski cross finals today, battling not just each other but a solid blanket of snow.
The weather is not letting up across Livigno in Italy, which could create some issues with events later today.
There have already been some events moved earlier in the Games due to the weather. We'll keep you across any updates!

Cooper Woods and Danielle Scott named as flag-bearers for Closing Ceremony
Olympic moguls champion Cooper Woods and aerial skiing silver medallist Danielle Scott will be Australia's flag bearers for the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony!
Woods won gold in week one of the games, becoming Australia's seventh Winter Olympic Champion in history.
Four-time Olympian Scott secured her first Olympic podium finish earlier this week, following a career high top score of 117.19 in the women's aerial skiing final.
The Closing Ceremony takes place in Verona in the early hours of Monday morning Australian time.
What are Aussies Indra Brown's chances in the halfpipe?
Does Cassie Sharpe being unable to compete in the event perhaps strengthen Indra’s chances a bit more for a medal? Don’t get me wrong, I’m obviously more concerned about her being healthy above all else. The woman is a 2 time medalist and a world champion though. She’s a very strong snowboarder.
- Anton
Australian teen freeski sensation Indra Brown may only be 16, but she's already catching the eye of some big names in her sport.
Earlier this week, the halfpipe defending champion Eileen Gu said the young Aussie was 'the real deal'.
If she has the ski of her life later in the final, she could very well be leaving Milano Cortina with a medal.
That, of course, is made easier with Canada's Cassie Sharpe out of contention after a nasty crash in the qualifications.
Sharpe, as you rightly point out Anton, is a quality freeskier. The 33-year-old is one of the sport's greats, having won gold in PyeongChang in 2018 and silver in 2022.
Results in for ski mountaineering mixed relay
Unfortunately Lara Hamilton and Phillip Bellingham of Team Australia have come in 12th out of 12.
🥇Emily Harrop and Thibault Anselmet of France
🥈Marianne Fatton and Jon Kistler of Switzerland

Macroscope | Why the IMF is right to press Japan on its fiscal risks
The fiscal and monetary policies of advanced economies have global repercussions, and Takaichi’s expansionary fiscal agenda risks market pushback
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is at last showing a bit of spirit. While it might not yet be attacking the egregious economic and financial antics of US President Donald Trump, it is at least turning its attention to the fiscal foibles of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
This matters more now than has been the case in recent years, or even decades, because what Japan does in terms of its fiscal and monetary policy is beginning to have international repercussions.
What political leaders like Takaichi or Trump don’t seem to realise is that they cannot charge ahead with populist policies on the domestic front without regard to their global impact. The discipline – though some might call it tyranny – of financial markets sees to that.

This is especially true of Japan, which for much of the post-war era remained a closed economy on the fiscal front because institutions such as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Government Pension Investment Fund absorbed most government debt. Japan could not afford to thumb its nose at foreign bond investors, but neither did it need continually to look over its shoulder at foreign investor reaction when it wanted to issue government debt.
That is changing now as the Takaichi government considers options such as suspending a consumption tax on food and possibly reducing taxes in other areas while stepping up spending on defence. This is in line with pledges made before this month’s lower house parliamentary election.

In seeking to make itself into a leading asset management centre – something that was a focus of former prime minister Fumio Kishida – Japan has been actively and successfully courting portfolio investment from outside, including in Japanese government bonds.

No reckoning over ethnic cleansing of Bulgaria's Turks

No reckoning over ethnic cleansing of Bulgaria's Turks
February 21, 2026Banya Bashi Mosque in Bulgaria's capital Sofia is one of Europe's oldest Muslim places of worship. Built in the 16th century, it serves as a reminder of almost 500 years of Ottoman rule over the country.
Bulgaria is home to the largest Turkish community in the Balkans. Around 500,000 ethnic Turks live in the southeastern European country of 8 million, making up about 8% of Bulgaria's total population, according to a 2021 census.
Most are descendants of Turkish settlers who came to Bulgaria with the Ottoman conquest in the 14th and 15th centuries. Many settled in the southern and north-eastern provinces of Bulgaria. Members of this ethnic minority, who largely subscribe to Sunni Islam, still speak Turkish, unlike the Bulgarian-speaking Muslims known as Pomaks.
Long history of cultural exchange
There are also Muslims among Bulgaria's approximately 750,000 Roma. And more Muslims have immigrated from the Middle East and Afghanistan since 2015. A 2017 survey by political scientist Evgenia Ivanova of Sofia's New Bulgarian University found that 89% of Bulgarian Muslims identify as religious. But this does not necessarily translate to piousness.
"Across Bulgaria, religiosity is relatively low," says Marina Liakova, a sociologist with the University of Education in Karlsruhe, Germany. She is an expert on migration and religion in Bulgaria. "For Christians and Muslims, it is more of a cultural religiosity."
While most Muslims observe the fasting month of Ramadan, going to the mosque on Fridays is uncommon, Liakova says. It is likewise rare to find Bulgarian Muslim women wearing headscarves, she adds.
"During the 500 years of Ottoman rule, Christians and Muslims influenced each other culturally, linguistically and culinarily," explains the researcher. "In everyday life, both groups live together like neighbors in friendly coexistence."
Yet attitudes towards Islam have also hardened of late owing to the recent arrival of Muslim immigrants from Syria and Afghanistan, says Liakova, reminding some, she says, of the time of Ottoman rule.
Ethnic cleansing under communism
In 1984 and 1985, communist dictator Todor Zhivkov forced ethnic Turks to give up their names and adopt Bulgarian names instead. The aim of this effort, officially known as the "rebirth process," was to destroy the ethnic identity of Bulgaria's Turkish population.
Following protests, more than 360,000 Turkish Bulgarians were deported to Turkey in 1989, making it the most extensive ethnic cleansing campaign in Europe since 1945 — a campaign that communist Bulgaria cynically referred to as "the great excursion."
The army sealed off and invaded entire Turkish villages. Somewhere between several hundred and up to 2,500 Bulgarian Turks were murdered during this period, according to estimates by human rights organizations.
The post-communist 1991 constitution enshrined the rights of all ethnic and religious groups in Bulgaria. That said, the Orthodox Church still enjoys a privileged position as the country's "traditional religion." The country's history of forced assimilation and ethnic cleansing remain sensitive issues.
In 2012, the parliament in Sofia issued a landmark declaration clearly naming and condemning past human rights violations and calling on the judiciary to take action. But nothing came of it; not a single perpetrator was brought to trial, let alone convicted.
Bulgaria 'flying under the radar'
"There is no political willingness for a reappraisal [of the past]," says Tomasz Kamusella, a historian and expert on southeastern Europe who teaches at Scotland's St Andrews University. "Many of those who are in power today were involved in the ethnic cleaning back then. Nobody wants to open that can of worms."
Dictator Todor Zhivkov is still revered as a "great European statesman" in Bulgaria today, Kamusella said, with little awareness among political elites of the role he played in past crimes.
"The events were traumatic for the Turkish minority and Bulgarian society as a whole," says sociologist Liakova. "They are hardly ever talked about, not even in families. Only a few journalists and scientists work on this topic."
Property belonging to Bulgarian Turks was confiscated in the course of the ethnic cleaning campaign. In 2023, the grand mufti of Bulgaria's Muslim community, Mustafa Hadji, reportedly sought to reclaim mosques and property that had been expropriated under the communist regimebut his efforts were in vein.
Neither the European Union nor Turkey are exerting pressure on Bulgaria to confront its past. "Bulgaria is flying under the radar," Kamusella told DW. Turkey mainly uses its influence to shape Islam in Bulgaria in accordance with its own interests through the Diyanet religious authority, which finances new mosques and regulates imam training.
Political representation fractured
Bulgaria's Movement for Rights and Freedoms party (DPS), the country's third-largest political force, saw itself as a mouthpiece for the country's Turkish minority.
The DPS has certainly advocated for better infrastructure in minority settlements. But according to Kamusella, it has always avoided sensitive issues: the difficult past questions of identity, restrictions on the approval of mosque construction, and the fact that Turkish is not a language of instruction in Bulgaria's state education system.
In July 2024, the DPS split. Oligarch and media entrepreneur Deljan Peewski took control and renamed the party "DPS-New Start," while long-time chairman Ahmed Dogan founded the new Alliance for Rights and Freedoms party. At that time, there were also allegations of electoral fraud and vote buying by Peevski, the first ethnic Bulgarian to head the DPS.
The list of allegations against Peevski is long: it ranges from bribery and influence peddling, embezzlement, and mafia connections to intimidation of opposition figures. He has been under US sanctions since 2021. The anti-government protests since November 2025 were also directed against Peevski, who, although not part of Prime Minister Rossen Shalyaskov's conservative GERB party government, supported it in parliament.
The DPS is "just as much a part of Bulgaria's corruption- and scandal-ridden political system as the others," Kamusella said.

South Korea lodges protest with US Forces Korea over rare US-China jets standoff
US, Chinese fighter jets engaged in brief standoff over Yellow Sea on Wednesday during US Air Force drill
ISTANBUL
South Korea lodged a protest with the US Forces Korea early this week over its rare standoff with Chinese fighter jets during a training aircraft drill over the Yellow Sea, local media reported on Saturday.
Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back lodged the complaint in a call with Gen. Xavier Brunson, the commander of the Combined Forces Command and the US Forces Korea, immediately after he received a report of the incident on Wednesday, the Seoul-based Yonhap News reported, citing unnamed military sources.
South Korea's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Jin young-sung, also lodged a complaint in a call with Gen. Brunson.
US and Chinese fighter jets engaged in a brief standoff over the Yellow Sea on Wednesday during an air exercise of the US Air Force, which involved 10 F-16 fighter jets.
The F-16 jets reportedly flew to an area between the respective air defense identification zones of South Korea and China.
The move prompted the Chinese military to dispatch its own fighter jets to the scene, but no clash occurred.
The US Forces Korea, a subordinate unified command of the US Indo-Pacific Command, had informed Seoul's military of its plan ahead of the training operation but apparently did not elaborate on the details, including the purpose of the drills, according to the South Korean officials.
South Korea is one of the US’ oldest and closest allies, hosting around 28,500 American soldiers on the Korean Peninsula under a mutual defense treaty between Washington and Seoul.

Belarus at OSCE PA: European security facing its most profound crisis since Helsinki

MINSK, 21 February (BelTA) - The European security space is currently experiencing its deepest crisis since the Helsinki Final Act was signed. This is clearly evidenced by the overall assessment of the situation in the OSCE in 2025, Sergei Rachkov, Chairman of the Standing Commission on International Affairs of the House of Representatives, said at a meeting of the OSCE PA Standing Committee in Vienna, Austria, BelTA learned from the press service of the House of Representatives.
According to the MP, the organization is essentially losing its ability to function as a full-fledged platform for equal dialogue and the development of consensus decisions. “The Belarusian delegation considers it unacceptable when the OSCE PA Chairmanship invited as a guest of honor and provides a platform to a person who is prosecuted in Belarus under the law on extremist activities. The Belarusian delegation resolutely rejects the Chairmanship's attempts to impose on us contacts that we do not need. Let us focus on strengthening dialogue between the member states of the OSCE PA” he said.
Sergei Rachkov noted that the military-political dimension of the OSCE is currently in a state of deep stagnation: dialogue on arms control and confidence-building measures has essentially been curtailed, a high degree of mutual distrust persists, and discussion of military stability issues is being replaced by politicized rhetoric.
According to the Belarusian MP, the economic and environmental dimension is also significantly politicized. Instead of substantive discussions on sustainable development, transport connectivity, energy security, and environmental challenges, the agenda is often tied to sanctions-related and confrontational topics, which reduces the practical benefits of cooperation among participating states.
The humanitarian dimension remains the most conflict-ridden, Sergei Rachkov continued. Human rights issues are increasingly being used as a tool of political pressure on states that are inconvenient to the Western majority, which undermines trust and hinders the formation of a unifying agenda, originally embedded in the OSCE mandate.
“Belarus experiences the crisis of European security not theoretically, but directly - in the form of increased military activity near our borders, the construction of barriers, and the severance of transport and economic ties. Instead of jointly addressing common challenges, we are witnessing a policy of isolation and sanctions pressure,” the MP said.
Under these conditions, Belarus is forced to take responsive measures to ensure its own security, he noted. “At the same time, we are acting transparently and in strict accordance with international law,” Sergei Rachkov emphasized.
He pointed out the key task today - to begin a serious discussion on a new, inclusive architecture of Eurasian security. “Belarus is ready for an honest, equal, and professional conversation at any platform, including the annual Minsk International Conference, about the future of security on our common continent, not against anyone, but to prevent a new big war,” he said.
Tense agenda
As it has been reported, a delegation of the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus to the OSCE PA, led by Chairman of the Standing Commission on International Affairs of the House of Representatives Sergei Rachkov participated in the 25th Winter Meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna, Austria on 19-20 February.
According to Sergei Rachkov, the agenda of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's winter session is very tense, with discussions primarily focused on issues related to European security. Participants did not avoid the topic of Ukraine. At the same time, as the Belarusian delegation noted, the intensity was decreasing.
“Many delegates supported the proposal of the delegation of the Republic of Belarus to engage in dialogue rather than conflict. It is very important that we are now at a very dangerous stage in the development of our region. And a number of delegations are beginning to realize this; to a certain extent, common sense is returning to the discussion of pressing issues.”
“The Belarusian delegation is meeting understanding regarding the points we raise both at the meeting of the general committee on political affairs and at the meeting of the committee on economic affairs," the MPs noted.
He indicated that the Belarusian delegation continued to very firmly raise the issue of the Europeans' sanctions against the Republic of Belarus.
Sergei Rachkov noted that there were a number of positive speeches, in particular by the OSCE secretary general, who spoke in favor of inclusive dialogue, discussion of complex issues, and the search for the reasons why the organization is in crisis.
“At the meeting of the political committee, the rapporteur of this committee addressed the topic related to the inadmissibility of exerting influence on a state. The implication here was, of course, directed at the United States of America, President Trump's actions primarily regarding Greenland. And statements and theses were voiced that coincide with our approaches - that let's engage in economic cooperation rather than exert pressure on each other,” the MP reported.
The Belarusian delegation held many bilateral meetings and contacts. There were conversations with the secretary general of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, a meeting with the head of the Austria-Belarus Business Council, discussions on economic issues and opportunities for expanding bilateral trade under the current circumstances surrounding Belarus. A very important meeting took place with MPs from Slovakia, among others.
“There is very strong interest in communicating with Belarus. It is emphasized that Europe is beginning to understand the detrimental nature of the policy being pursued by the leadership of the European Union, that it is necessary to find common ground and together think about how to prevent Europe from sliding toward catastrophe,” the MP concluded.

Istanbul opens sacred Hırka-i Şerif for Ramadan visitors

In a special observance of the holy month of Ramadan, the Hırka-i Şerif, one of the sacred relics believed to have been gifted to Veysel Karani by the Prophet Muhammad, has been opened for public visitation at the Hırka-i Şerif Mosque in Fatih, Istanbul.
The ceremonial opening, held on the first Friday of Ramadan, drew prominent figures including Istanbul Governor Davut Gül, Fatih Mayor Ergün Turan and Barış Samir, the 59th-generation descendant of Veysel Karani, alongside family members and other dignitaries.
Veysel Karani was a highly respected figure from Anatolia known for his devotion to the Prophet Muhammad.
The event commenced with a recitation from the Qur’an, followed by prayers led by Ahmet Aktürk, the Mufti of Bilecik. After the ceremony, visitors were invited to view the Hırka-i Şerif.
Visitors expressed profound emotions upon seeing the relic. Ali Eryiğit, who traveled from Nazilli in the western province of Aydın, described the experience as “beautiful and peaceful,” adding, “words cannot capture my feelings. May everyone have a chance to witness this.”
Another visitor, Ömer Faruk Uçar shared that he left his home early in the morning to see the relic and felt immense joy and serenity during the visit.
Throughout Ramadan, the Hırka-i Şerif will be open Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
On the night of Laylat al-Qadr (March 16), following Tarawih prayers, visits will continue until 3 a.m., and on the day before Eid, the viewing will conclude after afternoon prayers with a special ceremony.
Laylat al-Qadr is considered the holiest night of Ramadan, believed to be when the Qur’an was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.
Special arrangements have been made for visitors with disabilities, the elderly, patients and pregnant women, allowing them to access the relic without waiting in line, assisted by mosque staff.

Why this forgotten corner of Manchester could signal a turning point in British politics
A by-election in Gorton and Denton next week could see a new left and right emerge in British politics, as Dan Haygarth finds out
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Gorton and Denton is a constituency of two halves.
On the east, the Gorton side, there are diverse suburbs of the city of Manchester, which are home to large student and Muslim populations.
Denton meanwhile, located in the borough of Tameside, is a largely working-class post-industrial town and has a much older population, who are almost 91 per cent white. Once a hive of textile production and coal mining, it has – like many towns in the North West – borne the brunt of deindustrialisation.
These two very different areas make up the country’s 15th most deprived seat, where the challenges of living in modern Britain are laid bare. The neighbouring areas share a sense of disappointment, verging on anger.
Voters in the constituency will go to the polls for a crunch by-election on Thursday – one which could bring the curtain down on Sir Keir Starmer’s premiership and have a lasting impact on the makeup of British politics.
This constituency –and its previous iterations – has long been a brick in Labour’s Red Wall. Even when Boris Johnson convinced so many lifelong Labour voters to back his Conservative Party, with a promise to “get Brexit done”, voters here remained loyal to the region’s political traditions.
But the disillusionment felt among its residents could herald a new political era, redefining the age-old battle between the left and right.
Now retired, then-Labour MP Andrew Gwynne was elected with a 13,000 vote majority at the 2024 general election – ahead of Reform UK and the Green Party in second and third.
Those runners-up now have the seat well and truly in their sights. Labour has everything to lose and faces a fierce fight to hold on.
Voters have told The Independent they feel let down by Sir Keir’s government. They think they have already been forgotten about by a party that this constituency has always been loyal to, and helped elect 19 months ago.
There is no love lost for the prime minister, and the decision to block the popular Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham from standing as the Labour candidate went down badly.
Taxi driver Muhammed Basharat, 61, from Levenshulme on the Gorton side, said he will be voting for the Green Party, partly due to disappointment with Labour.
“They let down many people – the tax rises, they cut benefits, there are many things they are doing,” he said.
“The people are not happy. You speak to people in the street, the British people, they’re not happy with them.”
Mobile hairdresser Caterina Pandolfo, 65, said there was a feeling that Gorton and Denton had been “forgotten”. “I think it’s quite sad”, she said. “It’s got worse.” She hoped a Labour government could go some way to addressing that, but doesn’t believe it has.
She said: “I don’t think he’s doing very well at all, Keir Starmer, sadly. He could have done so much.”
Over in Denton, lifelong Labour voters John Harrison, 71, and Sheila Harrison, 69, said they would not vote for the party again.
Sheila, who described Britain as “broken”, said Sir Keir doesn’t represent towns like hers, though she would have voted for Mr Burnham.
For John, it’s a case of broken promises.
“Labour isn’t really doing what you know they said that it was going to do in the manifesto,” he said, adding that he feels let down by the government.
Despite that, one change in the Labour Party could win them back. “I would have voted for Andy Burnham,” John said.
He said Mr Burnham has more personality and is able to connect with northern voters. He believes the Greater Manchester mayor is on his side in a way that Sir Keir, who he describes as “aloof”, is not. Sheila would agree,
Hoping to take advantage of this feeling of abandonment in a Labour heartland are Reform UK candidate – GB News presenter Matthew Goodwin – and the Green nominee Hannah Spencer.
The Independent requested an interview with Mr Goodwin and contacted Reform for comment.
The Independent has revealed that Mr Goodwin suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment in an unearthed blog post and called for women and young girls to be given a “biological reality” check, as he gave his views on how Britain should tackle its impending “fertility crisis”.
Polling suggests Mr Goodwin is expected to perform well in Denton, while support for plumber and councillor Ms Spencer in Gorton is evident from the posters and signs on display.
Ms Spencer believes that the by-election is the beginning of a battle between a new left and right in British politics – now represented by her party and Nigel Farage’s Reform in place of Labour and the Conservatives.
“I think people are rejecting that old system of two-party politics and looking for an alternative,” she told The Independent.
“What’s happened in the last couple of years shows that change in the political system can happen quite quickly.”
Ms Spencer believes this has been exacerbated by Labour’s bruising time in power. Though the party has seen a recent uptick in national opinion polls, it still trails to Reform, and the prime minister’s approval ratings remain low.
“At the last general election, it felt like it was one last chance that Labour were being given,” she said, adding: “They ran under a banner of change, and has anything actually changed?”
That feeling is particularly acute in an area like this, Ms Spencer believes.
She said: “I think it hurts harder, when you feel like you’ve fallen for the person who was going to help you.”
Labour’s candidate, councillor Angeliki Stogia, insisted a vote for anyone but her could hand the seat to Mr Goodwin as she defended her party’s record in government.
She said: “In terms of Reform, we’re fighting every door. We’ve got policies, we’re listening to residents on the ground and what they want, and what they want is real action.
“They don’t want shouting from the sidelines. The real issues that people are bringing forward are cost of living, issues that surround the neighbourhoods and communities.”
“I am the best person to deliver on that,” she added.
As for criticism of the government’s record, she said: “I understand that, and the prime minister has said that we need to go faster and we need to go deeper in terms of delivering these changes.
“We’ve been in government for 18 months. Things take a lot of time to change.”
Last May, just 35 miles away in Runcorn and Helsby, Reform’s Sarah Pochin was elected by a margin of just six votes. There is a suggestion that Labour and the Green Party could split the vote on the left here and open the door for Reform to win another seat in the region.
But asked if the two parties could forge a progressive alliance, Ms Spencer was not interested.
“I don’t view them as a progressive force at all,” she said.
“I think they’re so far removed from what they ever were, that I find it really hard to see how, even with making some changes, they would be someone that we would work with.”
Instead, she believes her party leader Zack Polanski should have his eyes on Downing Street.
“I think it is definitely possible that at the next general election we could be looking at a Green government,” she said.
“I think we’ve shown in the last six months, the amount of new members that we’ve got that have joined, the amount of people that are coming out to help in elections like this shows that there’s a real appetite for change.”
What Ms Spencer and Ms Stogia do agree on, however, is Reform. Asked about the possibility of Nigel Farage’s party winning in this constituency, Ms Stogia said: “I think that people’s voices are not going to be listened to.
“I think that division will take root in our communities, and I think that a Reform MP is not going to lean in and listen and work with communities to resolve issues in the area.”
For Ms Spencer, a vote for the Greens is one for “hope”, rather than “division” with Reform.
“It’s a really diverse constituency with different people from a lot of different backgrounds, but with a shared value of looking after each other,” she said.
“It’s a very Greater Manchester thing that people do just muddle along, even if you sometimes believe in slightly different things, like you do look after each other.”

Three cities, nine stars, one signature

Björn Frantzén is the only chef in the world currently operating three Michelin three-star restaurants simultaneously in three different cities. FZN in Dubai proves that this achievement is not an expansion story, but the portability of a system.
I first visited in May 2025. It was the night before the Dubai Michelin ceremony and the restaurant had only been open for six months — one of the most charged moments on Dubai’s gastronomic calendar. The following evening’s stars were the only subject in the room, and for the first time, the possibility of three stars was being spoken of seriously in the city. That was the dominant conversation at our table. “Of course, our goal is three stars,” they said, “but expecting that only six months after opening may not be realistic. Most likely two…”
When three stars were announced the next evening, I still remember the thin line between astonishment and elation in the room. The celebration was not merely the success of a restaurant; it marked a threshold for a gastronomic scene Dubai had been carefully constructing for years. And standing at that threshold was one of the most ambitious chefs in the world: Björn Frantzén, alongside Executive Chef Torsten Vildgaard and General Manager Karin Ågren, who successfully translated the group’s DNA into a new geography.
Frantzén today operates three Michelin three-star restaurants simultaneously in three different cities —Stockholm, Singapore and Dubai. That sentence alone carries weight. But the real story is not the number of stars; it is the ability to reproduce the same level of excellence across different cultural contexts, different teams and different product landscapes. In this sense, FZN Dubai is not a branch; it is the Gulf manifesto of the Frantzén philosophy.
When I recently returned to the restaurant for a second visit, the memory of the first was still vivid. This time my curiosity was different: What does a restaurant that reaches the summit in six months do to remain there? Once the excitement of the stars fades, how does the system function? To describe FZN simply as a restaurant would be insufficient. It presents a carefully designed evening dramaturgy. The experience does not begin in a formal reception area but in a living room-like setting where small bites are offered. Dim yet not somber, refined yet not distant. The first contact is disarming. The ritualistic tension often associated with fine dining is intentionally softened here.
One of the most striking details for me was the marble chamber before the main dining experience. In this refrigerated display, all the ingredients to be served that evening are presented individually, each explained together with its origin. Shellfish from Norway, a seafood delicacy from Japan, a carefully selected cut of meat… These are not merely ingredients; they are identities. This is perhaps the purest contemporary definition of luxury: Transparency and traceability.
After the amuse-bouchés, we moved upstairs. Dining around the open fire transforms the experience into something interactive. Ingredients cooking over flame, chefs in motion, final touches being applied to the plates… You are not merely an observer; you are part of the process. This is not spectacle but controlled intimacy. Finally, the evening descends to the terrace level. With the Dubai skyline as a backdrop, the tempo slows. Petit fours, final drinks, conversation… What is being offered here is not simply food but a carefully structured night — extended in time, calibrated in rhythm, composed of emotional rises and falls.
At the center of this experience is, of course, the menu. FZN’s menu is not just a tasting sequence; it is a concentrated expression of the gastronomic identity Frantzén has built over years. This language can be read on three levels. First, the deliberate balance between Nordic discipline and Japanese sensitivity is evident. A dish like råraka openly acknowledges Swedish heritage, while shiro kombu, unagi, chawanmushi and otoro introduce Japanese references. This is not fusion. Fusion tends to blur identities. What Frantzén achieves is fluency between two culinary languages within the same sentence.
In the chawanmushi, the traditional Japanese form is preserved, yet enriched with smoked beef and razor clam, introducing a Northern European depth. The fatty texture of otoro is balanced with the acidity of fermented tomato and the aromatic lift of coriander seed. These are not decorative gestures but structural decisions. Precision without excess.
The second layer concerns the definition of luxury. Here, luxury is not communicated through embellishment but through provenance and selectivity. Langoustine. Koshihikari rice. Bafun uni. Vacche Rosse. Périgourdine. Each carries a geographic signature. In Dubai, where luxury is often associated with spectacle, this quieter articulation — rooted in sourcing and execution — feels particularly significant.
The third and perhaps most crucial layer is memory. Some dishes are not seasonal; they are identity. “French Toast Grand Tradition 2008” is the most powerful bridge on the menu. Created in Stockholm in 2008 and never removed since, this truffle-laced interpretation with Vacche Rosse cheese and aged balsamic is the distilled essence of Frantzén’s DNA. Serving it in Dubai signals something fundamental: This is not expansion, but continuity. The fact that it remains on the menu even after three stars confirms that success has not altered the core. It is not merely a dish; it is a manifesto of consistency. Råraka serves a similar function — an acknowledgment of roots, a refusal to abandon origin.
Chawanmushi exemplifies another principle: Preserve the form, rewrite the content. Otoro with fermented tomato and caviar demonstrates controlled intensity. Powerful flavors coexist, yet none overwhelms the other.
Ultimately, this menu communicates three things simultaneously: Identity is preserved, technical courage remains intact, and luxury is defined not by spectacle but by product and precision. And perhaps most importantly, this is not a menu written after receiving three stars. It is a menu that explains why those three stars were awarded in the first place.
Where to stay
In recent years, Atlantis-The Palm has significantly strengthened its gastronomic credentials through collaborations with world-renowned chefs, becoming one of the resort destinations in the Middle East with the highest concentration of Michelin-starred restaurants. Within this context, FZN by Björn Frantzén stands out as one of the most compelling expressions of the hotel’s fine dining vision. Located at the apex of Palm Jumeirah’s crescent and opened in 2008, the iconic property embodies the concept of a true “destination resort,” offering more than 1,500 rooms, including its signature underwater suites. While large-scale attractions such as Aquaventure Waterpark and The Lost Chambers Aquarium draw leisure travelers from around the world, its private beaches, spa facilities, and high-end restaurant portfolio elevate the experience into a multi-layered expression of contemporary luxury. Today, Atlantis-The Palm is regarded not only as a landmark of Dubai but as one of the Gulf region’s leading gastro-luxury resort brands.

From 17th-century merchant routes to modern-day disaster relief, a newly opened exhibition in the southern city of Gaziantep offers a powerful look at the 400-year bond between the Netherlands and Türkiye.
Covering a vast range of themes from Delft Blue ceramics to Ottoman tulips, the exhibition explores historical and contemporary ties through diverse narratives, highlighting everything from commercial relations to instances of solidarity during challenging times.
Prepared in the context of the 400-year history of Dutch–Levant trade relations, the exhibition traces the arrival of Dutch merchants on Levantine coasts in the 17th century and shows how these connections evolved over the centuries.
At the heart of the exhibition is a large wall tapestry inspired by Johannes Vermeer’s famous painting Girl with a Pearl Earring, hand-stitched by more than 100 women affected by the twin earthquakes on Feb. 6, 2023.
Through a collective production process, the women expressed their experiences of loss and grief.
Speaking at the opening, Mayor Fatma Şahin emphasized Gaziantep’s long-standing role as a center of trade, culture and solidarity.
She underlined the importance of the city’s production capacity, export strength and entrepreneurial character in economic cooperation between the two countries.
Referring to the Feb. 6 earthquakes, she also recalled the support provided by Dutch institutions and rescue teams, noting that the shared heritage between the two countries extends beyond trade to strong human bonds.

Murky outlook for businesses after tariff ruling prompts countermoves by Trump
Murky outlook for businesses after tariff ruling prompts countermoves by Trump
NEW YORK (AP) — Businesses face a new wave of uncertainty after the Supreme Court struck down tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump under an emergency powers law and Trump vowed to work around the ruling to keep his tariffs in place.
The Trump administration says its tariffs help boost American manufacturers and reduce the trade gap. But many U.S. businesses have had to raise prices and adjust in other ways to offset higher costs spurred by the tariffs.
It remains to be seen how much relief businesses and consumers will actually get from Friday’s ruling. Within hours of the court’s decision, Trump pledged to use a different law to impose a 10% tariff on all imports that would last 150 days, and to explore other ways to impose additional tariffs on countries he says engage in unfair trade practices.
“Any boost to the economy from lowering tariffs in the near-term is likely to be partly offset by a prolonged period of uncertainty,” said Michael Pearce, an economist at Oxford Economics. “With the administration likely to rebuild tariffs through other, more durable, means, the overall tariffs rate may yet end up settling close to current levels.”
Efforts to claw back the estimated $133 billion to $175 billion of previously collected tariffs now deemed illegal are bound to be complicated, and will likely favor larger companies with more resources. Consumers hoping for a refund are unlikely to be compensated.
The fight against tariffs continues
With Trump’s unyielding position on tariffs, many businesses are braced for years of court battles.
Basic Fun, a Florida-based maker of toys such as Lincoln Logs and Tonka trucks, last week joined a slew of other businesses in a lawsuit seeking to claw back tariffs paid to the government.
While company CEO Jay Foreman is concerned about any new tariffs Trump may impose, he doesn’t think they will affect toys. Still, he said, “I do worry about some type of perpetual fight over this, at least for the next three years.”
The new 10% tariff Trump announced Friday immediately raised questions for Daniel Posner, the owner of Grapes The Wine Co., in White Plains, New York. Since wine shipments take about two weeks to cross the Atlantic, he wonders if he had a shipment arriving Monday, would it be subject to a 10% tariff?
“We’re reactive to what’s become a very unstable situation,” Posner said.
Ron Kurnik owns Superior Coffee Roasting Co. in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, across the border from Canada. In addition to U.S. tariffs, Kurnik faced retaliatory tariffs from Canada for much of last year when he exported his coffee.
“It’s like a nightmare we just want to wake up from,” said Kurnik, whose company has raised prices by 6% twice since the tariffs went into effect. While he’s pleased with the Supreme Court’s ruling, he doesn’t think he will ever see a refund.
Industries pine for more stability
A wide array of industries, including retail, tech and the agricultural sector, used the Supreme Court ruling as an opportunity to remind Trump of how his trade policies have affected their businesses.
The Business Roundtable, a group that lobbies on behalf of more than 200 U.S. companies, released a statement encouraging the administration to limit the focus of tariffs going forward to specific unfair trade practices and national security concerns.
In the retail industry, stores of all stripes have embraced different ways to offset the effects of tariffs — from absorbing some of the costs themselves, to cutting expenses and diversifying their supply network. Still, they have had to pass on some price increases at a time when shoppers have been particularly sensitive to inflationary pressures.
Dave French, executive vice president of government relations for The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail industry trade group, said he hoped lower courts would ensure “a seamless process” to refund tariffs. That issue wasn’t addressed in Friday’s ruling.
For the technology sector, Trump’s tariffs caused major headaches. Many of its products are either built overseas or depend on imports of key components. The Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents a spectrum of technology companies employing more than 1.6 million people, expressed hope that the decision will ease the trade tensions.
“With this decision behind us, we look forward to bringing more stability to trade policy,” said Jonathan McHale, the association’s vice president for digital trade.
Farmers, who have been stung by higher prices for equipment and fertilizer since the tariffs went into effect, and reduced demand for their exports, also spoke out.
“We strongly encourage the president to avoid using any other available authorities to impose tariffs on agricultural inputs that would further increase costs,” said American Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall.
Industries that aren’t feeling any relief
The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not give the president authority to tax imports, a power that belongs to Congress. But the decision only affects tariffs imposed under that law, so some industries will see no relief at all.
The decision leaves in effect tariffs on steel, upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, according to the Home Furnishings Association, which represents 15,000 furniture stores in North America.
At Revolution Brewing in Chicago, the aluminum they use for cans costs as much as the ingredients that go inside them because of tariffs Trump has placed on metals that are not affected by the Supreme Court ruling. While the cans are made in Chicago, the aluminum comes from Canada, said Josh Deth, managing partner at the brewery.
Tariffs have been just one challenge for his business, which is also affected by volatile barley prices and a slowdown in demand for craft beer.
“Everything kind of adds up,” he said. “The beverage industry needs relief here. We’re getting crushed by the prices of aluminum.”
Reaction overseas
Italian winemakers hard-hit by the tariffs greeted the Supreme Court decision with skepticism, warning that the decision may just deepen uncertainty around trade with the U.S.
The U.S. is Italy’s largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. New tariffs on the EU, which the Trump administration initially threatened would be 200%, had sent fear throughout the industry, which remained even after the U.S. reduced, delayed and negotiated down.
“There is a more than likely risk that tariffs will be reimposed through alternative legal channels, compounded by the uncertainty this ruling may generate in commercial relations between Europe and the United States,” said Lamberto Frescobaldi, president of UIV, a trade association that represents more than 800 winemakers.
Elsewhere in Europe, initial reaction focused on renewed upheaval and confusion regarding costs facing businesses exporting to the US.
Trump’s tariffs could hit pharmaceuticals, chemicals and auto parts, said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING bank. “Europe should not be mistaken, this ruling will not bring relief,” he said. “The legal authority may be different, but the economic impact could be identical or worse.”

The Supreme Court struck down Trump’s tariffs. Now comes the hard work of issuing refunds
The Supreme Court struck down Trump’s tariffs. Now comes the hard work of issuing refunds
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday struck down President Donald Trump’s biggest and boldest tariffs. But the justices left a $133 billion question unanswered: What’s going to happen to the money the government has already collected in import taxes now declared unlawful?
Companies have been lining up for refunds. But the way forward could prove chaotic.
When the smoke clears, trade lawyers say, importers are likely to get money back — eventually. “It’s going to be a bumpy ride for awhile,” said trade lawyer Joyce Adetutu, a partner at the Vinson & Elkins law firm.
The refund process is likely to be hashed out by a mix of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, the specialized Court of International Trade in New York and other lower courts, according to a note to clients by lawyers at the legal firm Clark Hill.
“The amount of money is substantial,” Adetutu said. “The courts are going to have a hard time. Importers are going to have a hard time.’’
Still, she added, “it’s going to be really difficult not to have some sort of refund option’’ given how decisively the Supreme Court repudiated Trump’s tariffs.
In its 6-3 opinion on Friday, the court ruled Trump’s attempt to use an emergency powers law to enact the levies was not valid. Two of the three justices appointed by Trump joined the majority in striking down the first major piece of his second-term agenda to come before them.
At issue are double-digit tariffs Trump imposed on almost every country in the world last year by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The Supreme Court ruled that the law did not give the president authority to tax imports, a power that belongs to Congress.
The U.S. customs agency has already collected $133 billion in IEEPA tariffs as of mid-December. But consumers hoping for a refund are unlikely to be compensated for the higher prices they paid when companies passed along the cost of the tariffs; that’s more likely to go to the companies themselves.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh dinged his colleagues for dodging the refund issue: “The Court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the Government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers.’’
Borrowing a word that Justice Amy Coney Barrett — who sided with the majority — used during the court’s November hearing on the case, Kavanaugh warned that “the refund process is likely to be a ‘mess.’”
“I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years,” Trump told reporters at a press conference Friday, in which he decried the court’s decision and said he was “absolutely ashamed” of some justices who ruled against his tariffs. “We’ll end up being in court for the next five years.’'
The end of the IEEPA tariffs could help the economy by easing inflationary pressures. The tariff refunds — like other tax refunds — could stimulate spending and growth. But the impacts are likely to be modest.
Most countries still face steep tariffs from the U.S. on specific sectors, and Trump intends to replace the IEEPA levies using other options. The refunds that do get issued will take time to roll out — 12 to 18 months, estimates TD Securities.
The U.S. customs agency does have a process for refunding duties when importers can show there’s been some kind of error. The agency might try to build on the existing system to refund Trump’s IEEPA tariffs, said trade lawyer Dave Townsend, a partner with the law firm Dorsey & Whitney.
And there has been a precedent for courts making arrangements to give companies their money back in trade cases. In the 1990s, the courts struck down as unconstitutional a harbor maintenance fee on exports and set up a system for exporters to apply for refunds.
But the courts and U.S. customs have never had to deal with anything like this — thousands of importers and tens of billions of dollars at once.
“Just because the process is difficult to administer doesn’t mean the government has the right to hold on to fees that were collected unlawfully,″ said trade lawyer Alexis Early, partner at the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.
Ryan Majerus, a partner at King & Spalding and a former U.S. trade official, said it’s hard to know how the government will deal with the massive demand for refunds. It might try to streamline the process, perhaps setting up a special website where importers can claim their refunds.
But Adetutu warns that “the government is well-positioned to make this as difficult as possible for importers. I can see a world where they push as much responsibility as possible onto the importer’’ — maybe forcing them to go to court to seek the refunds.
Many companies, including Costco, Revlon and canned seafood and chicken producer Bumble Bee Foods, filed lawsuits claiming refunds even before the Supreme Court ruled, essentially seeking to be at the head of line if the tariffs were struck down.
There are likely to be more legal battles ahead. Manufacturers might, for example, sue for a share of any refunds given to suppliers that jacked up the price of raw materials to cover the tariffs.
“We may see years of ongoing litigation in multiple jurisdictions,’’ Early said.
Consumers, though, are unlikely to enjoy a refund windfall. The higher prices they’ve had to pay would likely be hard to attribute to a specific tariff. Should they pursue refunds anyway? Early wouldn’t advise wasting money on legal fees, but said: “In America, we have the ability to file a lawsuit for anything we want.’’
Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat and Trump antagonist, is demanding a refund on behalf of his state’s 5.11 million households. In a letter addressed to Trump and released by Pritzker’s gubernatorial campaign, the governor said the tariffs had cost each Illinois household $1,700 — or $8.7 billion. Pritzker said failure to pay will elicit “further action.’'
Nevada Treasurer Zach Conine submitted a payment request to the federal government for $2.1 billion to recoup the costs of the tariffs, his office announced Friday.
“As Nevada’s chief investment officer, I have a responsibility to try to recoup every single dollar that the Trump Administration takes from Nevada families,” Conine said in a statement.

A mom wrote a book to help her kids process their dad’s death. Now she’s on trial for his killing

A mom wrote a book to help her kids process their dad’s death. Now she’s on trial for his killing
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A year after her husband died, a mother of three in Utah self-published a children’s book that she said helped her sons cope with the sudden loss. Kouri Richins promoted her book “Are You With Me?” on a local TV station and drew praise for helping young children process the death of a parent.
Weeks after the book’s publication in 2023, she was arrested in her husband’s death and charged with murder.
The arrest sent shock waves through her small mountain town just outside Park City, where a 12-person jury is set to decide her fate in a monthlong trial that starts Monday.
Richins, 35, faces nearly three dozen counts in connection with her husband’s death, including aggravated murder, attempted murder, forgery, mortgage fraud and insurance fraud. She has pleaded not guilty.
Prosecutors say she killed her husband, Eric Richins, at their home in March 2022 by slipping fentanyl into a cocktail that he drank. They say she was deep in debt and killed him for financial gain while planning a future with another man she was seeing on the side.
The chilling case of a once-respected local author accused of profiting off her own violent crime has captivated true-crime enthusiasts in the years since her arrest. Once lauded as a touching read, her book has since become a tool for prosecutors in arguing that she carried out a calculated killing.
Her defense attorneys, Wendy Lewis, Kathy Nester and Alex Ramos, said they are confident the jury will rule in Richins’ favor after hearing her side of the story.
“Kouri has waited nearly three years for this moment: the opportunity to have the facts of this case heard by a jury, free from the prosecution’s narrative that has dominated headlines since her arrest,” her legal team said in a statement. “What the public has been told bears little resemblance to the truth.”
Documents allege two poisonings
On the night of her husband’s death, Richins called 911 to report that she had found him “cold to the touch” at the foot of their bed, according to the police report. He was pronounced dead, and a medical examiner later found five times the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system.
That was not her first attempt on his life, charging documents allege.
A month earlier, on Valentine’s Day, Eric Richins told friends he broke out in hives and blacked out after taking one bite of a sandwich that Richins had left for him. She had bought the sandwich the same week police say she also purchased fentanyl pills from the family’s housekeeper. Opioids, including fentanyl, can cause severe allergic reactions.
After injecting himself with his son’s EpiPen and chugging the allergy medication Benadryl, Eric Richins woke from a deep sleep and called a friend to say, “I think my wife tried to poison me,” the friend said in a written testimony.
A day after Valentine’s Day, Kouri Richins texted her alleged lover, “If he could just go away ... life would be so perfect.”
Key witnesses
The friend Eric Richins called that night and the housekeeper who claims to have sold his wife the drugs could be key witnesses in the upcoming trial. Others may include family members and the man with whom Kouri Richins was allegedly having an affair.
The prosecution’s star witness, housekeeper Carmen Lauber, told police she gave Richins fentanyl pills she bought from a dealer a couple of days before Valentine’s Day. Later that month, Richins allegedly told the housekeeper that the pills she provided were not strong enough and asked her to procure stronger fentanyl, according to charging documents.
Defense attorneys are expected to argue that Lauber did not actually give Richins fentanyl and was motivated to lie for legal protection. Lauber is not charged in connection with the case, and detectives said at an earlier hearing that she had been granted immunity.
No fentanyl pills were ever found in Richins’ home, and the housekeeper’s dealer said he was in jail and detoxing from drug use when he told detectives in 2023 that he had sold Lauber fentanyl. He later said in a sworn affidavit that he only sold her the opioid OxyContin.
Money as motivation
Charging documents indicate Eric Richins met with a divorce attorney and an estate planner in October 2020, a month after he discovered that his wife made some major financial decisions without his knowledge. She had a negative bank account balance, owed lenders more than $1.8 million and was being sued by a creditor, according to court documents.
Prosecutors say Kouri Richins mistakenly believed she would inherit her husband’s estate under terms of their prenuptial agreement. She had also opened numerous life insurance policies on her husband without his knowledge, with benefits totaling nearly $2 million, prosecutors allege.
She is also accused of forging loan applications and fraudulently claiming insurance benefits after her husband’s death.

Court clears way for Louisiana law requiring Ten Commandments in classrooms to take effect
A U.S. appeals court has cleared the way for a Louisiana law requiring poster-sized displays of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms to take effect.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 12-6 to lift a block that a lower court first placed on the law in 2024. In the opinion released Friday, the court said it was too early to make a judgment call on the constitutionality of the law.
That’s partly because it’s not yet clear how prominently schools may display the religious text, if teachers will refer to the Ten Commandments during classes or if other texts like the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence will also be displayed, the majority opinion said.
Without those sorts of details, the panel decided it did not have enough information to weigh any First Amendment issues that might arise from the law. In other words, there aren’t enough facts available to “permit judicial judgment rather than speculation,” the majority wrote in the opinion.
In a concurring opinion, Circuit Judge James Ho, an appointee of Republican President Donald Trump, wrote that the law “is not just constitutional — it affirms our nation’s highest and most noble traditions.”
The six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, with some arguing that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.
Circuit Judge James L. Dennis, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, wrote that the law “is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.”
The ruling is the result of the court’s choice to rehear the case with all judges present after three of them ruled in June that the Louisiana law was unconstitutional. The reversal comes from one of the nation’s most conservative appeals courts, and one that’s known for propelling Republican policies to a similarly conservative U.S. Supreme Court.
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry celebrated the ruling Friday, declaring, “Common sense is making a comeback!”
The ACLU of Louisiana, one of several groups representing plaintiffs, pledged to explore all legal pathways to continue fighting the law.
Arkansas has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court. And a Texas law took effect on Sept. 1, marking the widest reaching attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.
Some Texas school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases challenging the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.
The laws are among pushes by Republicans, including Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state, while backers say the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.
Joseph Davis, an attorney representing Louisiana in the case, applauded the court for upholding America’s “time-honored tradition of recognizing faith in the public square.”
Families from a variety of religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, have challenged the laws, as have clergy members and nonreligious families.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation, another group involved in the challenge, called the ruling “extremely disappointing” and said the law will force families “into a game of constitutional whack-a-mole” where they will have to separately challenge each school district’s displays.
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after the ruling that she had sent schools several correct examples of the required poster.
In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in eastern Pacific, killing 3
US military strikes another alleged drug boat in eastern Pacific, killing 3
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat floating in the water before bursting into flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to at least 148 people in at least 43 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.”
Critics have questioned the overall legality of the strikes as well as their effectiveness, in part because the fentanyl behind many fatal overdoses is typically trafficked to the U.S. over land from Mexico, where it is produced with chemicals imported from China and India.
The boat strikes also drew intense criticism following the revelation that the military killed survivors of the very first boat attack with a follow-up strike. The Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers said it was legal and necessary, while Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the killings were murder, if not a war crime.

5 European nations pledge millions to use Ukrainian know-how to make cheap drone defenses
WARSAW (AP) — Five European nations have announced a new program to produce low-cost air defense systems and autonomous drones using Ukrainian expertise hard-won over the past four years of war against Russia.
Friday’s initiative of the E5 nations — France, Poland, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy — comes as one of many European efforts to bolster defense along their borders, like a “ drone wall ” with Russia and Ukraine to better detect, track and intercept drones violating Europe’s airspace.
Both Moscow and Kyiv have cutting-edge drone warfare capabilities forged in the grim laboratory of war where battlefield innovations have rewritten modern battle tactics. Poland is already working with Ukraine on drone technology in joint military training programs and manufacturing projects.
Those efforts were sparked by a spate of incidents in which Europe’s borders and airports have been tested by rogue drones. Russia has been blamed for some of them but denies that anything was done on purpose or that it played a role.
“The UK and our E5 partners are stepping up — investing together in the next generation of air defense and autonomous systems to strengthen NATO’s shield,” said Luke Pollard, Britain’s minister for defense readiness and industry.
“We have some of the best kit on the entire planet for shooting down air threats. The problem is to be effective at shooting down relatively low-cost missiles, drones, and other threats facing us,” he said. “We need to make sure that we’re matching the cost of the threats with the cost of defense.”
Poland’s defense minister, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, said the group of countries signed an agreement to jointly invest in the production and procurement of drone-based strike capabilities as well as cheap drone defense systems in a program called called Low-Cost Effectors and Autonomous Platforms, or LEAP.
“Combat technologies and techniques are changing rapidly — we must respond quickly and appropriately,” Kosiniak-Kamysz said. “We also signed a crucial commitment regarding the joint development of drone-based strike capabilities, low-cost joint production, and joint procurement of drone effectors, i.e, combat payloads, using artificial intelligence.”
When Russian drones entered Polish airspace in September 2025, Warsaw and its NATO allies used multimillion-dollar jets to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Low-cost kinetic or electronic effectors would allow the detection and destruction of drones at a fraction of the price.
Europe has scrambled to arm itself in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump’s deep criticism of NATO, European defense spending and once iron-clad alliances. The EU has ramped up spending and is openly questioning even deeper military projects.
“Europe’s security is more uncertain than it has been in decades,” said Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, citing Russian aggression, instability in the Middle East, China and a “redefined” alliance with the U.S. She said that the low-cost interceptor program exemplifies the European commitment to its own security.
“If we want to keep our country safe, we must strengthen our hard power. The good news is that we are already investing record sums in defense. Europe is stepping up. but it’s not about competing with NATO. It’s about making Europe stronger within NATO. A stronger Europe makes the alliance also stronger.”
Yet the 32-nation military alliance has been shaken by Trump’s second administration. Most recently, his repeated threats to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, and disparaging remarks about his NATO allies’ troops in Afghanistan drew another outcry.
While tensions over Greenland have subsided for now, the infighting has seriously undercut the ability of the world’s biggest security alliance to deter adversaries.

Ramadan’s first Friday prayers are held at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque

Ramadan’s first Friday prayers are held at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque
Ramadan’s first Friday prayers are held at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered under heavy Israeli restrictions at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound for the first Friday prayers of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, including some who were allowed to enter from the occupied West Bank.
The Ramadan prayers at Al-Aqsa took place for the first time since a shaky ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas went into effect in October. It was the first opportunity many had to leave the West Bank and pray at the site in Jerusalem’s Old City since Ramadan last year.
Israel restricted the number of Palestinians allowed to enter from the West Bank to 10,000 on Friday, and only allowed men over 55 and women over 50 as well as children up to 12. It has imposed similar restrictions in the past, citing security concerns.
A frequent flashpoint
The hilltop, which Jews refer to as the Temple Mount, is the holiest site in Judaism and was home to the ancient biblical temples. Muslims call the site the Noble Sanctuary. Today it is home to Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam.
It has frequently been a flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Israeli police said more than 3,000 police were deployed across Jerusalem. They said their presence was not meant to show aggression or force but was aimed at providing help in case of an emergency.
Many Palestinians view the heightened Israeli security presence, and increasing visits by religious and nationalist Israeli Jews, as a provocation. They fear that Israel intends to take over or partition the compound. The Israeli government denies having any such plans.
Jerusalem’s Islamic Waqf, the Jordanian religious authority that administers the compound, said there were 80,000 in attendance. In normal times, Ramadan Friday prayers at Al-Aqsa can draw up to 200,000.
Ezaldeen Mustafah, a Palestinian from the West Bank, was among those lamenting the restrictions.
“We need more people than this,” he said.
Some Palestinians from the West Bank on Friday said they were turned away from crossing into Jerusalem even though they had permits. Jihad Bisharat said he was told his permit had been canceled and was sent back. Israel’s army didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Old City, home to major religious sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims, is in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state with its capital in east Jerusalem. Israel annexed east Jerusalem, a move not recognized by most of the international community, and considers the entire city to be its capital.
Ramadan in Gaza
Many Palestinians said the month’s typically festive spirit is eluding them as they struggle with grief and losses following two years of conflict in Gaza sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel.
“All the mosques have been bombed,” said Ramiz Firwana, a Gaza resident who gathered with other worshippers for a Friday sermon and prayers held in schoolyard.
On Thursday evening, families sat amid the rubble and destruction for iftar, the meal held at the end of the daily dawn-to-dusk fast.
“Despite the displacement, the pain and the destruction, we want to rejoice and live,” said Mohammad Kollab, from Khan Younis. “We are not a people destined only for destruction and killing.”
Israel’s military offensive has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and caused widespread destruction and displaced most of the territory’s residents. Israel launched the offensive after Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took another 251 hostage in the initial attack.
The Oct. 10 U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal has brought an end to major military operations and the release of the remaining hostages. But Palestinians, including many civilians, are still being killed in near-daily strikes that Israel says are aimed at militants who threaten or attack its forces.

In war-weary Kyiv, wounded Ukrainian veterans turn epic poetry into living testimony

In war-weary Kyiv, wounded Ukrainian veterans turn epic poetry into living testimony
In war-weary Kyiv, wounded Ukrainian veterans turn epic poetry into living testimony
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Sitting in a circle the day before opening night, Ukrainian war veterans and drama students took turns reading their lines from a script that traveled centuries to reach them.
At the center was Olha Semioshkina, directing the group through her adaptation of “Eneida” by Ivan Kotliarevskyi — an 18th-century Ukrainian reimagining of Virgil’s “Aeneid.” This production, though, had a modern-day message about resilience in the face of the war that’s nearing its fourth year since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The actors — men and women in their 20s to 60s — included Ukrainian military veterans who had returned from the front with amputations, severe burns and sight loss. Others had endured war on the homefront. Many had never set foot on a stage before this play.
The production was created by Theater of Veterans, an organization founded by members of Ukraine’s Territorial Defense Forces that provides theatrical training and stage opportunities for former service members as part of their reintegration and recovery.
It took more than a year to prepare for Thursday’s premiere at Kyiv’s National Academic Molodyy Theatre.
“We knew the guys had just come back from rehabilitation, and we had to start from the very beginning,” Semioshkina said.
“We spent about four months simply learning to communicate, to fall, to group, to roll, to get together,” she said. “Then we began developing the body, taking off prosthetics and learning to exist without them.”
The 51-year-old director’s concept was simple: “Every man on stage is Aeneas. Every woman on stage is Dido.”
In Virgil’s epic, Aeneas wanders after the fall of Troy, searching for a new homeland. In Kotliarevskyi’s satirical adaptation, the Trojan hero becomes a Cossack, rowdy and earthy.
On Kyiv’s stage, Aeneas wears prosthetic limbs and bears scars from the war that began with Russia’s Feb. 24, 2022, invasion of Ukraine.
“Aeneas is a hero who goes through a lot in search for his land,” Semioshkina said. “He preserves humor, passion, he falls, he goes through horrors, drinks and parties. But he is a human, and he has a goal — to find his place and preserve his family.”
She draws parallels between the veterans who endured combat and the character they play on stage. “Aeneas is the one who went to war. Yes, he returned mutilated, broken,” she said, but the actors bringing this adaptation to life “are learning to live” again.
Where myth and reality converge
During rehearsal, Yehor Babenko, a veteran of Ukraine’s Border Service who suffered severe burns early in the Russian invasion, delivered a line with a grin: “Feeling burned out at work? We have a lot in common.”
Later in the play, his monologue also hit close to home as he spoke about fire taking his hands, ears and nose. “I won’t be able to show children a trick with a missing finger,” he says. “Maybe the one when all 10 fingers disappear.”
The opportunity to perform onstage, Babenko said, has been a healing journey.
“For me, theater is both psychological and physical rehabilitation. I’ve noticed I feel my body better, feel more confident in public, express my thoughts better.”
For Babenko, the story of Aeneas resonates beyond the stage. “It’s about searching for your land,” he said. “And for our country, that’s very relevant now.”
Breaking character to tell their own stories
The play’s final act departed from epic poetry altogether as the actors stepped forward to tell their own stories — about combat injuries, lost brothers in arms, displacement and life under occupation.
One veteran described losing his leg in a drone strike and using a machine gun as a crutch to reach cover. A female actor recounted living under Russian occupation with her two daughters.
Another, who volunteered as a medic, first in 2014, when Russia illegally annexed Crimea and pro-Russian forces captured parts of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and again after the 2022 Russian invasion, spoke of returning to war in her 60s.
Andrii Onopriienko, who lost his sight in a Russian artillery strike near Avdiivka, in the Donetsk region, in 2023, narrated much of the performance in a deep, resonant voice. At one point he sang: “Let our enemies dig up holes, install crosses, and lie down on their own,” as the rest of the cast joined in.
Onopriienko initially refused to join the project. “I didn’t understand what I would do on stage blind,” he said. He later was persuaded that there would be a role for him.
“It’s positivity, laughter, support,” he said of rehearsals. “No matter what mood you come in, you leave with a big smile; Here you distract yourself from the present. You enter another world.”
Despite war, the show must go on
Onstage, prosthetic legs and arms were removed and put back on as part of the play’s visual language. Long metal rods doubled as swords, oars and crutches — used as both an artistic instrument and a tool to help actors with amputations keep balance.
The war intruded even before the curtain rose on Thursday. An announcement asked the audience to follow the usual theater protocol and silence their phones — then warned that in case of an air raid, they should head to the basement shelter. If a blackout occurred, it added, the show would pause for the backup power generators to be turned on.
As Babenko delivered his monologue minutes before the performance ended, the power did go out.
Semioshkina stepped onto the stage with a flashlight, followed by others holding flashlights. Babenko delivered his lines in the beam of the improvised spotlight. The audience, some quietly weeping, some laughing through tears, stayed.
When the last monologue ended and the curtain fell and rose again, the cast was met with a standing ovation. As they bowed a second time, the electricity returned, and the applause swelled.
For Semioshkina, the message of veterans on stage extends beyond epic poetry and the theater walls.
“I would like to send a message to all veterans who are sitting at home: Come out,” she said. “Come out. You can do something. Live. Don’t close yourself off. Live every single minute.”

Keeping calm and carrying on, the royal family weathers worst crisis in generations

The British royal family faces its worst crisis in generations
The British royal family faces its worst crisis in generations
LONDON (AP) — King Charles III’ s brother was under arrest. Police were searching two royal properties, and news commentators were endlessly discussing the details of a sex scandal with tentacles that stretched to the gates of Buckingham Palace.
So how did Britain’s royal family spend Thursday afternoon? The king sat in the front row on the first day of London Fashion Week. Queen Camilla attended a lunchtime concert, and Princess Anne visited a prison.
The decision to continue normal royal duties was more than just an example of British stoicism in the face of the monarchy’s biggest crisis in almost a century. It was the opening act of the House of Windsor’s fight for survival as the arrest of the former Prince Andrew threatens to undermine public backing for the monarchy.
After pledging to support the police investigation into his brother’s friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the king stressed his intentions.
“My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all,” he said in a statement signed “Charles R.,” using the abbreviation for Rex, the Latin word for king.
Biggest crisis since 1936 abdication
The simple fact that Charles made the statement showed the scale of the problem created by the arrest of the king’s 66-year-old sibling, now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was held for 11 hours and then released under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.
The event was so unprecedented that commentators had to reach back to the 1640s and the arrest and execution of King Charles I during the English Civil War to find a parallel.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office is shaping up to be the monarchy’s biggest crisis since Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry an American divorcee, Wallis Simpson.
That scandal weakened public support for the monarchy, which did not fully recover for 15 years. The turnaround came only after Edward’s successor, King George VI, refused to flee Britain during World War II, demonstrating his solidarity with a nation ravaged by Nazi bombs.
Even before she ascended the throne, Queen Elizabeth II followed her father’s lead and publicly pledged her life in service to Britain.
But while the impact of Edward’s abdication lingered for years, the crisis reached a crescendo in a few days. And the solution in that case was relatively simple: Edward stepped aside, and his oldest brother took his place.
By contrast, the drama surrounding Mountbatten-Windsor is ongoing, with no end in sight.
No ‘clear route forward’
The current crisis stems from revelations about the relationship between the former prince and Epstein that were uncovered when the U.S. Justice Department released millions of pages of documents last month from its investigation into Epstein.
Police have previously cited reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent trade information to Epstein, a wealthy investor, in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade.
At least eight U.K. police forces have said they are looking into issues raised by the documents.
Compared with previous royal scandals, “this time there doesn’t seem to be any clear route forward,’’ said Ed Owens, author of “After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?” “There’s no blueprint to follow” in terms of how the monarchy and associated organizations deal with the allegations.
The last time the monarchy had to manage these kinds of questions was after the death of Princess Diana, Charles’ ex-wife. Elizabeth and Charles were criticized for failing to respond to the outpouring of public grief as tens of thousands of people swarmed to Kensington Gardens to lay flowers outside the late princess’ home. Some even called for Charles to step aside as heir to the throne in favor of his son William.
The queen later commissioned focus groups to better understand the public mood and determine why people felt so strongly about a person they never met. The crisis forced the royals to recognize that Diana’s common touch had connected with people in ways that had not yet occurred to the House of Windsor.
Those lessons have since inspired other royals, including Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, to be more informal and approachable.
But this moment is different, in part because it is taking place in a rapidly changing media environment at a time when people are demanding transparency from their leaders.
Family could face uncomfortable questions
Moving forward also means facing uncomfortable questions about what the institution — and the family members themselves — may have known about Mountbatten-Windsor’s activities. The palace has sought to draw a bold line separating the former prince and the rest of the monarchy by stripping him of his titles, including the right to be called a prince.
In another blow for the former prince, the British government is considering formally removing him from the line of succession to the crown. Despite losing his status and his honors, Andrew remains eighth in line to the throne. That can only be changed with legislation.
Charles is the first monarch “that has to meet our expectations of figures in public life, which is to be accountable and to explain yourself,” said Craig Prescott, a royal expert at Royal Holloway, University of London. “And you always have to work to earn the support of the public. And that is a particular challenge when you’re facing a controversy such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.”
Critics argue that the monarchy was slow to respond to the pressure, given that Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Epstein have been discussed for more than a decade.
The best outcome for the monarchy is for the police investigation to focus solely on the information in the Epstein files and how that relates to Mountbatten-Windsor, said Peter Hunt, a former BBC royal correspondent. The worst outcome would be if police expand their inquiries to what the broader institution might have known and when.
“Were questions raised about his behavior as a trade envoy over those 10 years? Were they answered? What did people do about them?’’ Hunt said on the BBC.
And perhaps there’s more to learn.
“Will there be files?’’ he asked.

Younger generation breathes new life into Istanbul’s time-resistant niche crafts

Driven by a Gen Z-led fascination with nostalgia, Istanbul’s antique clock and turntable trades are undergoing a revival that preserves cultural heritage while generating significant economic value through rising global demand.
Once thought to be fading away, antique clocks, turntables and vinyl records are back in the spotlight, fueled largely by younger consumers seeking analog sound and craftsmanship.
This renewed attention has increased export sales and attracted foreign customers who travel to Istanbul for specialized repairs, where service costs are often lower than in Europe.
Birol Aldam, head of an Istanbul communications tradesmen’s chamber, said the sector struggled in the 1990s with the rise of private broadcasting and later digital formats.
However, according to Aldam, there has been a clear return to the past over the last four to five years.
“No matter how advanced technology becomes, it can’t replicate the sound quality and emotional experience of these devices,” he said.
Turntable technician Turan Şahin, with long years of experience, said young listeners are drawn to the “natural” sound of vinyl, including the subtle crackle that digital formats lack.
Standard vinyl records now start at around 1,000 Turkish Liras ($23), while rare antique pressings can reach 5,000 liras ($114) or more due to limited supply.
Proper storage and care are essential, he warned, as temperature changes can warp records.
Murat Bağcı, who has repaired turntables and video players since 1997, said demand rises in winter months and after schools reopen.
Antique devices dominate his workload, as newer models are often uneconomical to repair.
Master horologist Mehmet Ali Karaçuha, on the other hand, bridges the gap between old-world artistry and modern global demand at his workshop in Sirkeci.
"We have many clients coming from abroad because our service costs are much more competitive than those in Europe," Karaçuha said. "They bring their timepieces here; we perform the restoration and this in turn generates significant added value for the Istanbul economy."

HK Announces $870 Million Plan to Buy Back Flats in Tai Po Fire
Hong Kong proposed higher-than-estimated acquisition prices for owners who lost their homes in the Wang Fuk Court blaze last year, in a plan that will cost a total of HK$6.8 billion ($870 million), according to the officials.
Authorities will offer $10,500 ($1,340) per square foot for units that have paid the land premium — government’s subsidy on the homes — and HK$8,000 for those that have not, Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong said at a briefing on Saturday. Another option for affected residents will be a flat-for-flat arrangement, Wong said.

Istanbul’s most crowded district rejects its image of crime hub

Long framed in public debate as a hot spot for crime and disorder, Istanbul’s most populous district, Esenyurt, is fighting to shed its stigma by centering its identity on industrial power and working-class resilience, even as residents navigate the growing pains of rapid urbanization and rising costs.
According to official data, Esenyurt’s population has climbed to around 1 million, making it not only the largest district in Türkiye, but more populous than dozens of entire provinces and even several countries.
For Can Aksoy, the district’s acting mayor, the milestone is a mixed blessing.
“Passing one million brings pride, but also serious responsibility,” he said, noting that extreme density inevitably produces chronic urban problems.
Local surveys, he added, show that traffic and transportation top residents’ complaints — an unsurprising outcome in a district that produces nearly 7 percent of Türkiye’s total industrial output and attracts hundreds of thousands of daily commuters.
However, Aksoy argues that Esenyurt’s reputation for crime is misleading.
“We are ranked 17th in Istanbul in terms of public security, but on television we are portrayed as if we are number one,” he said, pointing out that the district’s daytime population approaches 1.5 million due to industrial activity.
New police stations, expanded surveillance systems and a 24/7 monitoring model are planned, with the stated aim of pushing Esenyurt further down the crime rankings.
What the district wants to be known for, Aksoy stressed, is production.
“We are first in industrial output. [Turkish defense company] Baykar manufactures here. Esenyurt is a city of workers.”
Esenyurt’s growth is driven by a mix of internal migration, foreign arrivals and large, multi-generational households.
Its relatively affordable housing compared with central Istanbul continues to draw people from across Türkiye, as well as migrants seeking proximity to jobs in nearby industrial zones.
That demand is reshaping the real estate market.
Property professionals say housing demand has never slowed, particularly for small apartments near the metrobus line.
According to real estate consultant Murat Kaya, the district also remains a magnet for investors.
Investors, Kaya added, are attracted by high yields and short amortization periods — even as new construction has slowed due to rising building costs.
On the street, reactions are mixed.
Residents acknowledge that the crowds are good for business but say the district has lost the calm it once had.
"Now, it’s a bit too crowded. The biggest issue we face is the rent,” said Mirali Akkaya, who has run a hair salon in the district for eight years.
Serkan Mutlukan, a local delivery courier, expressed a sense of displacement.
"I no longer feel like I’m in my own hometown," he said. "The presence of foreign nationals is particularly high in Esenyurt."
Local authorities say they are trying to offset density with livability: Expanding green spaces, converting idle plots into small parks and planning major new investments.
Yet they concede that Esenyurt has little room left to expand outward.

According to the US president, he "signed (the executive order) on a global 10% tariff on all countries, which will be effective almost immediately," TASS reported.
Earlier, against the backdrop of the US Supreme Court's decision against the presidential administration's use of tariffs, Trump said that he would impose a 10% tariff on all imports into the country. According to him, it should come into force in three days. The US president explained that he would keep tariffs related to "national security" in force.
On Friday, the US Supreme Court ruled that the US president had exceeded his authority by imposing tariffs on other countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). However, the highest court did not clarify whether the US should refund the money previously paid as tariffs.
On April 2, 2025, the US leader announced the introduction of tariffs on products from 185 countries and territories. Later, the president changed the tariff rate on imports from a number of countries. On August 29, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the president did not have the authority to impose many of the announced tariffs. On September 4, the US administration appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling.

InformNapalm: Ukrainian Hackers Discover How Russian Drone Operators Use Belarus

Ukrainian hackers hacked into Russian military accounts and gained access to the monitoring systems used by drone operators. This allowed them to determine how Russians are using Belarusian infrastructure to attack Ukraine.
The cyber operation was carried out by hackers from the Fenix cyber analytics center in cooperation with the international intelligence community InformNapalm.
During the operation, cyber experts hacked into the accounts of dozens of Russian military personnel and gained access to the monitoring systems used by drone operators.
Ukrainian hackers did not control the drones, but they were able to see the enemy’s actions and contribute to the effectiveness of the Ukrainian side’s countermeasures.
Intelligence officers organized round-the-clock covert surveillance of the accounts, during which data was promptly transmitted to the Ukrainian Defense Forces. This significantly improved the situational awareness of Ukrainian defenders and enabled them to effectively shoot down and suppress Russian drones.
As of September 2025, while analyzing data intercepted in Russian operators’ chat rooms, analysts found that Russia actively uses civilian infrastructure, in particular cell towers on the territory of Belarus, to lay routes for its drones.
In this way, the Russians ensured a stable signal for striking targets located on the northern and western borders of Ukraine, and even flew into the territory of NATO countries.
At the same time, in September 2025, analysts provided operational information to NATO partners that the flight of dozens of Russian drones in Poland on the night of September 9-10, 2025, was part of testing new tactics and capabilities of Belarusian civilian cellular infrastructure.
The Russians then planned to strike logistics routes in both Ukraine and Poland to cut Ukraine off from Western weapons and equipment supplies.
In total, the cyber operation lasted more than six months and, as of February 2026, had exhausted its operational reconnaissance capabilities, in particular as a result of the successful implementation of a series of operations by the Ukrainian Defense Forces.
In particular, the Defense Forces carried out effective strikes on command posts and drone launch sites in Russia and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, as well as on locations of the elite Russian Rubicon unit.
The culmination of the long-term cyber operation was the sanctions announced on February 18, 2026, by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky against Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko for his involvement in escalating and prolonging the war of the aggressor country, Russia.
As emphasized by the InformNapalm intelligence community, the experience of this and many other successful cyber operations has proven that deep penetration into the enemy’s communications, planning, and coordination systems has a significant impact on the course of hostilities.

"As a diplomat, I have the deepest respect for the colleagues in the military uniform, who often play a key role not only in defending the fatherland in the battles, but also in keeping the communication lines open," Ledenyov told an embassy reception ahead of the upcoming Defender of the Fatherland Day, TASS reported.
"In ensuring that children all over the world sleep peacefully because the great powers keep in touch in the form of a professional dialogue. Like it has happened recently in the framework of the negotiation process on Ukraine, which is actively supported by the current administration, unlike in previous years, when Washington shared the unrealistic dreams of the collective West about inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia. And as part of the new round of the negotiations held in Geneva this week, the conflict that began in the fraternal country because of the neo-Nazi ideology fostered there continues to move towards a settlement."
The talks between Russia, the United States and Ukraine were held in Geneva on February 17-18. Head of the Russian delegation Vladimir Medinsky described them as difficult but businesslike. According to him, a new round of negotiations will be held soon. The first round took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. On February 4-5, the second round took place.

New twist in saga of 500-year-old oak felled by Toby Carvery bosses
- An ancient oak tree, estimated to be 450-500 years old, was felled without permission by Toby Carvery outside its Whitewebbs House restaurant in Enfield, north London, on 3 April 2025.
- Despite Toby Carvery's claim that the tree was dying, a subsequent Forestry Commission investigation has now found it was still alive, identifying green shoots in the cut wood.
- Enfield Council, the landowner, is pursuing eviction proceedings against Mitchells & Butlers (M&B), Toby Carvery's operator, for serious lease breaches.
- Dr Ed Pyne of the Woodland Trust said the oak was irreplaceable and called for better legal protection for ancient trees.
- While police found no criminality and the Forestry Commission noted no breaches of legislation due to the tree lacking a preservation order, Toby Carvery's chief executive has apologised for the upset caused.

'Cuba's healthcare system is being pushed to the brink by US blockades,' says health minister

Cuba’s Health Minister says the country is headed to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, saying the US blockade of oil on his country is rendering hospitals helpless and puts thousands of lives at risk.
Cuban officials say the debilitated healthcare system has been pushed to the brink of collapse by the US blockading the country’s oil supply.
The country’s medical system was already perpetually crisis-stricken along with the island’s economy, with lack of supplies, staff and medicine long being the norm.
The situation however has reached a new extreme, with authorities now saying that ambulances are struggling to find fuel to respond to emergencies. Persistent power outages have also further deteriorated hospitals.
Flights bringing in vital supplies, which the island nation has been relying on since the blockade, have now stopped, as Havana is no longer capable of refuelling airplanes for their outbound flights from Cuban airports.
Experts and analysts say the blockade is pushing the country into a humanitarian crisis and have urged leaders to take measures to ensure civilians are not harmed.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Cuba’s Health Minister José Ángel Portal Miranda said that US sanctions are no longer just crippling the island's economy, they're threatening “basic human safety.”
“You cannot damage a state’s economy without affecting its inhabitants,” Portal said. “This situation could put lives at risk.”
According to Portal, 5 million people in Cuba living with chronic illnesses will see their medications or treatments affected. This includes 16,000 cancer patients requiring radiotherapy and another 12,400 undergoing chemotherapy.
Cardiovascular care, orthopaedics, oncology and treatment for critically ill patients who require electrical backup are among the most impacted areas, he said. Kidney disease treatments and emergency ambulance services have also been added to the list of impacted services.
The energy crisis Cuba has been grappling with for years entered new extremes last month after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would impose a tariff on any country that sells or provides oil to Cuba.
It came just weeks after Trump deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a dramatic military intervention and announced that no more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba.
Cuba, which produces only 40% of its own fuel and largely depends on oil to power the island, has long relied on allies like Venezuela, Mexico and Russia to fill its energy deficit. But those shipments have now dried up.
Trump has openly said that his larger hope is to push regime change in Cuba by intensifying economic pressure on the island, which has already struggled to cope with decades of US sanctions.
Washington’s pressure on Havana began after it accused the island country of providing security services to Maduro in exchange for oil and money. It has since urged the Cuban government to ink a deal to diffuse tensions.
Cuba has so far refused to enter into an agreement with the US, with President Miguel Díaz-Canel saying he’ll only negotiate with Washington under equal footing based on respect and has refused to entertain a deal which would undermine his country’s sovereignty.

Millions set to save £200 on energy bills – but it could be short-lived
- Energy bills are projected to drop significantly from April, with Ofgem expected to announce a £120 reduction in the energy price cap.
- The decrease is primarily due to the government's decision to scrap an energy efficiency programme.
- Around a quarter of households are anticipated to save over £200 this year, with the policy designed to benefit lower-income families most.
- Experts, including the Resolution Foundation, warn that these savings could be short-lived, potentially eroding by 2029 due to rising policy costs and infrastructure investment.
- The government is urged to establish a clear and durable framework for funding energy policy costs before 2029 to prevent a 'cliff edge' when current support ends.

France returns looted 'talking drum' to Côte d'Ivoire

France on Friday, February 20, handed over a "talking drum" looted by colonial troops from Côte d'Ivoire in 1916 in the latest repatriation of stolen artefacts. The Djidji Ayôkwé drum, more than three metres (10 feet) long and weighing 430 kilos (950 pounds) was used by the Ebrie tribe to transmit messages. It is one of hundreds of objects France is preparing to send back to Africa, with the efforts set to be accelerated by the passing of a new law to authorize mass repatriations.
The drum is to be exhibited permanently in a new museum being built in Côte d'Ivoire's commercial capital Abidjan. "All of Côte d'Ivoire is ready to welcome it," Ivorian Culture Minister Françoise Remarck said at a ceremony in Paris with her French counterpart Rachida Dati. Remarck added that she was "extremely moved" by the "return of this symbol" that is "finally coming back to its homeland."
France has been flooded with restitution demands from former colonies such as Algeria, Mali and Benin. Its national museums hold tens of thousands of artworks and other prized artefacts that were seized or purchased during the colonial era. European nations are slowly moving to return a limited number of looted artefacts in a bid to build bridges with their former colonies.

Lipar Wetland: Iran’s rare pink lake you must visit

Located near the coastal city of Chabahar, the Lipar Wetland stands out as one of Iran’s most unique natural attractions. Its soft pink color has turned it into a growing destination for domestic and international travelers.
Instead of asking why lakes are blue, visitors here often ask: How can water turn pink? And when is the best time to see it?
The name “Lipar” refers to the plain where the wetland is formed. In the local Baluchi language, Lipar describes the meeting point of river water and sea water, which is exactly how this wetland was created.
Lipar is a saline wetland located on an alluvial plain with an approximate area of 14 square kilometers. Its formation is influenced by rainfall, seasonal floods, and marine conditions. Human infrastructure, including the coastal road between Chabahar and Gawater, has also affected its current structure.
Importantly, the wetland is not permanently filled with water. Its existence depends heavily on monsoon rains and environmental conditions.
Why is the Lipar Wetland's water pink?
The Pink Wetland of Chabahar gets its color from natural biological processes.
The pink hue is primarily caused by the presence of phytoplankton and ecological interactions within the water. Around 90% of the plankton species in the wetland are plant-based microorganisms.
Several factors contribute to the color:
High concentrations of organic and mineral materials carried by rivers
Seasonal marine currents influenced by monsoon winds
Rapid growth of phytoplankton populations
Plankton levels increase from mid-June to September and typically reach their peak around December. During these periods, the pink color becomes more visible.
The water is saline, which supports this ecological process.
When is the best time to visit Lipar Wetland?
Lipar Wetland is most visually striking during:
February
March
April
September
October
In these months, water levels and plankton density combine to produce the clearest pink appearance.
Summer is generally not ideal due to high temperatures and reduced water levels.
In favorable rainfall years, the wetland may retain sufficient water for approximately three to four months at best.
Therefore, the optimal visiting window is from mid-winter through spring — when both water presence and color intensity align.
How to reach Lipar Wetland
Address:
Near the village of Ramin, 15 km east of Chabahar, along the coastal road between Chabahar and Gawater
Province: Sistan and Baluchestan, Iran
Access is typically through Ramin Village, connected via the coastal highway.
The contrast between pink water and blue sky at the Lipar Wetland creates a surreal visual effect — a scene that once seemed possible only in imagination or animated films. Today, travelers no longer need to visit fantasy worlds to see such colors.
Travel to southeastern Iran offers access to rare ecological phenomena combined with nearby attractions such as mini-mountain formations and other natural sites in the Chabahar region. Exploring Lipar Wetland means experiencing one of the world’s few naturally pink aquatic ecosystems — hidden yet accessible.

The rail ahead: as high-speed lines saturate China, how far can their global reach extend?
As Chinese giants eye Eurasia for new infrastructure, analysts speculate on what it will take to keep overseas projects from going off the rails in different host nations
Chinese railway giants look set to scout Eurasia in the years ahead to build high-speed train lines as the domestic market matures and some countries are more prepared than others for capital-intensive yet transformative ventures, analysts said.
Inspired by China-invested projects such as the 142km (88-mile) Jakarta-Bandung high-speed line in Indonesia and the partly finished 350km (217-mile) Budapest-Belgrade railway, Chinese construction and engineering firms are expected to expand their overseas footprint.
Projects abroad are now more crucial as giant domestic railway engineering firms, builders and operators are finding diminishing new ground to break in China, especially in cities.
“Like any engineering firms anywhere, they’ll be looking for new opportunities, but the fiscal positions of governments around the region will have to be quite careful in terms of how they spend money,” said Song Seng Wun, an economic adviser at Singapore-based fintech firm SDAX.
Analysts point to Southeast Asian countries such as Laos, Malaysia and Thailand as the most likely future destinations for Chinese-invested high-speed projects, with Central Asia not far behind as it leverages existing trade-linked infrastructure that China has already helped build there.

‘Grass roots’ taxi driver experiences host of ‘firsts’ during ‘trip of a lifetime’; pledges to take his family travelling when he has enough money
Two China-based foreign influencers who hired a taxi driver to take them on a 4,000-kilometre trip from the south to the north of the country gave their cabby what he has described as an “incredible” experience.
One, an Israeli internet celebrity called Raz Gal-Or is famous in China where he has 9.5 million followers and where he is known as Gao Yousi; the other is a French key opinion leader (KOL) whose Chinese name is Xiao Weihong.
On January 28, they began sharing a four-episode series of their road trip from the island province of Hainan in southern China to Harbin in Heilongjiang province in the northeastern part of the country.
The videos have attracted 3.6 million likes, Jimu News reported.
Gao, who has been studying and living in China for 17 years, said he initiated the project as he has always had a “crazy dream” of driving from the country’s south to the north.
He and Xiao tried to hire a taxi driver but were rejected many times until they met a driver surnamed Luo who agreed to take them.
They started from Haikou in mid-January and took a ferry to cross the Qiongzhou Strait to arrive at Xuwen Harbour in Guangdong province, southern China.

‘Psychological torture’: Spanish tenants fight back against housing ‘harassment’
Unknown

17:00:02 KST

When the Madrid building where Jaime Oteyza had lived since 2012 was sold to an investment fund two years ago, a local tenants’ union swiftly warned him what to expect.
First the tenants would be told that none of their rental contracts – regardless of their expiry date – would be renewed, the union said. Then, as the 50 or so families in the building grappled with what to do next, a series of construction projects would probably be launched in the building to ramp up pressure on them to leave.
“One by one, all of the situations that the union described began to happen,” said Oteyza. “Construction work was the weapon they used to make our lives impossible; power cuts, leaks, noise, drilling through walls, ceilings collapsing on top of gas stoves.”
It’s a pattern that housing campaigners say is playing out across much of urban Spain, as investors seek to cash in on the country’s roaring housing market. The aim is simple: to force out long-term tenants as quickly as possible to make way for more profitable tourist, short-term or luxury lets.
It’s come to be known across Spain as acoso inmobiliario, roughly translating as real estate harassment. The phrase refers to the myriad ways in which long-term tenants are subjected to worsening conditions so that they end their contracts on their own accord.
But within the walls of one nondescript building in the madrileño neighbourhood of Lavapiés, tenants may have found a way to fight back.
Last year, a dozen tenants, including Oteyza, turned to the country’s courts, alleging that the construction work was a bid to coerce them into ending their leases prematurely. Late last year, a court in Madrid agreed to hear the case, launching what housing campaigners say is the country’s first preliminary investigation into real estate harassment.
For residents of the building, the groundbreaking case has added another layer of complexity to their long-running battle. “It’s bittersweet,” said Cristina Gómez, who has lived in the building since 2020. The court’s decision was “nice, as it confirmed we’re not just imagining things,” she said. “But at the same time, this is the result of a lot of suffering. It’s a shit situation for everyone.”
The construction work began in November 2024. As the work led to flooding in some apartments and turned parts of the building into no-go zones, residents saw a clear attempt by the new owners to bypass the costlier, more time-consuming process of going through courts to evict them individually.
The tenants said they tried to negotiate with the new owners – at one point even offering to buy the building for the same amount that the investment fund had paid for it – as the company offered some tenants a few thousand euros to help with the move.
“They were very tough, very long conversations, at no point did they accept anything other than us leaving the building,” said Gómez.
Noise levels in the building skyrocketed, as drills and jackhammers rang out and rubble was felled, said Oteyza. For those at home during the day, it was a form of “psychological torture”, he said. “It’s really difficult to live with noise, eight hours a day, day in and day out.”
The father of two young children, Oteyza also worried constantly for their safety. “There’s a real fear that there will be an accident,” he said. “There might be a power tool plugged in on the landing. Or they’ve left a hole in the courtyard. These are risky situations.”
As one tenant, who asked to be named only as Nani, put it: “We’re resisting and we’ll continue to resist, but it’s really difficult,” she said. “But we have to do it – it can’t be that those who have money can come and buy and sell buildings without caring about the lives of the people inside.”
On at least five occasions, police and firefighters were called to the building as tenants wrestled with the fallout of the construction work. About 15 months after it began, residents say that about half of the tenants in the building have opted to leave.
It’s a hint of the kinds of situations that are playing out across Spain, said Alejandra Jacinto, a lawyer with the tenants’ union who helped draft the pioneering legal challenge. “From sending in eviction companies to carrying out construction works that cause damage, to putting glue in people’s locks, real estate harassment is a tool that is increasingly being used,” she said.
Both the legal challenge and the court’s decision to launch a preliminary investigation were trailblazing steps pushing back against this trend, she said. “I think it’s already sending a message that there’s no impunity and that not everything goes. You can’t act outside the law to achieve your goals.”
The court battle had made headlines across the country, she said, offering a glimmer of hope as many in Spain reel from the soaring cost of housing.
In January, campaigners in Barcelona announced that a local court had become the second to admit a case alleging real estate harassment. The case argues that the new owners of a five-floor building had left tenants without a working lift for more than a month, stranding elderly tenants and those with mobility issues, including one person who uses a wheelchair, in a bid to get them to leave.
In Madrid, weeks after news broke of the court’s investigation, the tenants said it had already had an impact. “Curiously enough, we noticed that when the case made headlines, they continued working but in a more orderly, more systematic way and respecting the noise levels,” said Oteyza.
In a statement to the Guardian, a legal representative for the building’s owner said the construction work was aimed at improving accessibility, reinforcing the building’s structure and renovating the roof, noting: “all of which are essential measures to ensure the safety and habitability of the property”. The company had all of the necessary permits to carry out the work, it said.
The spokesperson said agreements had been reached with more than 30 tenants in the building, in a show of their “commitment to dialogue and the search for mutually agreed upon solutions”.
It added: “Aware of the inconvenience that this type of work can cause, and in order to minimise the impact on the lives of the residents, the owner has offered alternatives from the outset to the residents directly affected by the work, providing them with options for temporary relocation to other homes and accommodation adapted to their needs.”
At the building in Lavapiés, the tenants were bracing themselves for a legal battle that could stretch on for months, if not years. But for Gómez, it was an absolute necessity. “What’s happening to us is something that is happening every day, all the time around us,” she said. “I think we need to show them that we’re willing to enforce the law, that we know our rights and are going to assert them.”
In a country where the average rent has doubled in the past decade, it also felt as if it was the only option, she added. “It’s not like I can just go to somewhere nearby or another neighbourhood, it’s impossible,” she said. “So where does one go?”

This week is the final opportunity to cast a vote in the European Tree of the Year contest. The competition, often dubbed the Eurovision of trees, features Lithuania’s Tree of the Year – the Laukiai Oak, which grows in the Skuodas district, northwestern Lithuania.
According to the Laura Ūselytė, director of the Skuodas District Tourism and Information Centre, such titles encourage tourism and helps raise the country's profile abroad, as visitors often to travel to see the winning trees.
The community of Rukai village has been supporting its oak in every way it can – even serenading it with songs.
“That oak wouldn’t have grown so much if we didn’t play music for it. We play, come back and it’s bigger, play again – and it grows even more, that’s how it grows,” said band leader Gintautas Petrauskas.
The oak, believed to be around 400 years old, is one of twelve trees competing for the title of European Tree of the Year.
“Lithuania has a historic chance to finally win this year – we just all need to make the effort. We, the Rukai village community, have done a great deal: we’ve tidied up the surroundings, organised many celebrations and created a wide range of video clips,” said local community representative Egida Skurdauskienė.
Planted by the Laukiai family in Rukai village, the oak has watched over six generations who lived there. Jonas, whose wife comes from the Laukiai family, still lives on the homestead.
For many years the oak was forgotten and neglected, but work began last year to restore the site.
With the help of farming machinery and many volunteers, the area has been cleaned up, a bench installed and an information plaque dedicated to the oak.
The Rukai community now marks its celebrations there, and the tree has become the heart of the village.
“This is not a beauty contest for trees. The main aim is to show the relationship between people and the tree, the bond it has with the community and what ties them together. The winners of the European Tree of the Year are included on the European tree map,” Skurdauskienė explained.
The Laukiai Oak led the vote for a time, but during this final week of voting the results are no longer being made public. Instructions on how to vote are available on the arboristai.lt website.
“Only one vote per person can be counted. You cannot keep clicking every day,” noted Laura Ūselytė, director of the Skuodas District Tourism and Information Centre.

Inside the ECB, Irritation Grows Over Lagarde’s Handling of Exit
Confused, irritated, uncertain. Inside the European Central Bank, staff are in shock by reports that President Christine Lagarde will quit before her term is up, leaving questions about her authority.
A number of Governing Council members are perplexed by the lack of pushback to the speculation, according to people familiar with the matter. Lagarde’s response this week was in stark contrast to her firm denial to similar reports in 2025.

European Commission responds to Hungary's blocking of €90bn for Ukraine
The European Commission expects that Hungary and other EU member states will follow through on agreements reached by EU leaders on 19 December 2025 and approve a €90 billion loan to support Ukraine in 2026-2027.
Source: European Commission spokesperson Balázs Ujvári, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The European Commission hopes Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán will honour the commitment he made at the European Council meeting on 19 December and back the allocation of €90 billion to Ukraine.
Ujvári stated that during the European Council meeting in December, EU leaders reached a unanimous political agreement to provide €90 billion in decisive support for Ukraine's budgetary and military needs over the next two years.
He noted that the European Commission had adopted a legislative package on 14 January based on this agreement.
The Commission expects that all member states will honour this political agreement in order to ensure the final approval of the loan, Ujvári stressed.
Background:
- Hungary has stated that it is blocking a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline.
- Meanwhile, Kyiv has proposed that the EU use alternative elements of Ukraine's oil transport network, particularly the Odesa-Brody pipeline, to deliver crude to Hungary and Slovakia following damage to the Druzhba oil pipeline caused by a Russian attack.
- The European Council agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan for 2026-2027, based on EU borrowing on capital markets and backed by EU budget reserves. However, Hungary, Slovakia and Czechia have refused to take part in the scheme.

North East Link quietly scraps promised wildlife crossing, leaving kangaroos stranded
The North East Link project has quietly reneged on a promise to build a wildlife crossing under a busy road in Rosanna, outraging residents already distressed by the $26 billion toll road’s ecological impact.
Construction of the new tollway from Bulleen to Greensborough is destroying nearly 54 hectares of native vegetation, including about 16,000 trees, near the Yarra River, and Banyule and Koonung creeks.
In response to community concerns, the project agreed in 2023 to include a tunnel under Lower Plenty Road in Rosanna so kangaroos, wombats, echidnas and other animals could move from Simpson Barracks and Borlase Reserve down to the Banyule Flats Reserve.
But community advocates discovered late last year that the project has removed the crossing from its plans and instead proposes only building a rope ladder for possums.
Planning Minister Sonya Kilkenny approved the design revision to the project’s Urban Design and Landscape Plan on November 13.
Don Stokes, who lives nearby in Heidelberg and is a member of the Friends of Banyule group, said the underpass and new wildlife corridor would have gone a small way to offset the loss of habitat around Simpson Barracks.
“There was such a massive amount of habitat loss there – now all that is missing,” he said.
“An underpass ... will facilitate wildlife migration along the Banyule Creek habitat corridor. That’s why the under-road crossing was proposed in the first place,” he said.
Stokes said kangaroos had been showing up lost on local streets, including Lower Plenty Road, since construction started and that the underpass would give them a safe crossing.
Friends of Banyule president Michelle Giovas said it was symbolic of the project’s attitude towards residents that they only learnt about the underpass’s removal after she asked about it at a Community Liaison Group meeting.
“It’s unbelievable that NELP [North East Link Project] can deliver a 6.4 kilometre twin [road] tunnel but they cannot deliver a wildlife crossing that they promised the community,” she said.
“Our suburb and our people have had to put up with constant dust pollution, light pollution, water pollution and noise. Knowing that wildlife were at least being considered would at least go some way to address the pain everyone is feeling.”
A North East Link spokesperson said the removal of the underpass was based on advice from ecological experts and considered the length of the crossing, availability of natural light and the movement of native animals in the area.
“A crossing point for larger animals would encourage larger animals closer to Lower Plenty Road, increasing the risk to wildlife, drivers and cyclists,” they said.
“The planned underpass has been revised to a rope bridge, so possums and other climbing species can safely integrate within the area.”
Stokes said the Warringal Conservation Society had spent the past 50 years working to restore habitat around Heidelberg, Viewbank and Rosanna, and it was frustrating to see so much of it destroyed.
NELP has promised to plant at least two new trees for every one tree it knocks down during construction.
In addition to the planned removal of vegetation, residents were alarmed last year when construction contractor Spark allowed chemicals to spill into Banyule Creek, turning it bright blue.
In January, a tunnelling mishap caused 7.5-metre-wide sinkhole to open up at the AJ Burkitt Oval in Heidelberg, forcing sports teams off the ground for months.
Aiv Puglielli, Greens MP for North-East Metro, said the state government had “repeatedly blindsided our community with this project”.
“How can Jacinta Allan’s Labor government justify the environment destruction of this project, and what more are they willing to risk in the name of more cars, more tolls and billions more in budget blowouts?” he said.
The North East Link is due to be completed in 2028. Originally set to cost $10 billion when former premier Daniel Andrews committed to it in 2016, the toll road’s budget has blown out to $26 billion.

- Charles Bronson's plea for release is set to be considered at an oral hearing in the coming months, marking his ninth attempt for parole.
- The 73-year-old, who has spent most of the last 50 years in prison for a string of violent crimes, has vowed to “expose” his “unlawful sentence and treatment”.
- In an open letter to Sky News, Bronson claimed he is 23 years over his tariff, has been consistently denied progress, and is perpetually kept in solitary confinement.
- His lawyer, Gurdeep Singh, believes that with the right support, Bronson should be released to continue his charity work.
- Bronson, who received a discretionary life sentence in 2000, says he has changed, now finding solace in art and professing to be “anti-crime” and non-violent.

Live: More than 3000 march in Lyon for slain far-right activist Quentin Deranque
Around 3,200 people on Saturday participated in tribute rally in Lyon for slain far-right activist Quentin Deranque, who was fatally beaten in a street brawl between ultranationalist and anti-fascist militants, according to the Rhône prefecture. French President Emmanuel Macron earlier earlier called for calm at the rally, where authorities have deployed a large police presence amid security concerns.

Rally arrives at Rue Victor Lagrange, paying tribute to Quentin Deranque at the spot where he was killed
Demanstrators reached the end of their route, on rue Victor Lagrange, in the 7th arrondissement of Lyon, where the young far-right activist Quentin Deranque was fatally beaten.
The crowd paid tribute to him, some protesters lit torches and stood in silence before a banner that read "Farewell comrade".
'Heavy', 'sad' and 'increasingly intense' atmosphere at rally for killed far-right activist
Several hundreds joined a march organised by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
Reporting from Lyon, FRANCE 24's Olivia Bizot said the atmosphere was "heavy, sad and increasingly intense", adding that "several young men carrying wooden sticks" were present at the rally.

Around 3,200 people marched in France's southeastern city of Lyon on Saturday in memory of a far-right activist whose killing has been blamed on the hard left, according to estimates by the prefecture for the region.
The rally, widely publicised online by ultra-nationalist and far-right groups, had been expected to draw thousands of people and was held under heavy security, with authorities fearing clashes with left-wing protesters.

Many political slogans chanted
“The far left kills,” “LFI accomplices, anti-fascist assassins,” and “Young guard in prison, free the city of Lyon.”

Several far-right fringe groups present at the march
The call to join the march was widely shared on social media by far-right fringe groups including the “national-revolutionary” Allobroges Bourgoin, the feminist collective Némésis, the “national-identitarian” group Audace Lyon, and the monarchist, nationalist and anti-republican movement Action française.
Before the procession set off, a tribute to Quentin Deranque was held at the traditionalist Church of Saint-Georges, where services are conducted in Latin and which the young man attended.
Hundreds march in Lyon to protest far-right activist's killing
Several hundreds joined a march organised by far-right groups on Saturday after a nationalist activist died from a beating in Lyon in an incident that highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year's presidential vote.
French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm ahead of the tribute to Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old who died of brain injuries in a hospital last week.
Deranque was attacked during a fight that erupted between far-left and far-right supporters on the margins of a student meeting where a far-left lawmaker, Rima Hassan, was a keynote speaker.
Macron said he will hold a meeting with ministers next week to carry out a comprehensive review of all violent activist groups that have links to political parties. He hinted that some groups could be dismantled.
“In the Republic, no violence is legitimate,” he said. “There is no place for militias, wherever they come from. We must be absolutely uncompromising.”
The main tribute to Deranque took place in Lyon, where clashes between far-right activists and far-left groups have become frequent. Their fighting often takes the form of organised street battles in the city, sometimes involving groups of several dozen people.
Lyon’s far-left-leaning militant groups are more recent and were created in reaction to the many far-right groups that have been present for several decades. The city is seen by intelligence services as the cradle of far-right activism in France.
Deranque’s parents also called for calm and did not take part in the tribute, which was not banned by French authorities.

'I don't want Lyon to be the capital of the far right,' says Mayor Grégory Doucet
"I don't want Lyon to be the capital of the far right," declared Lyon Green Party mayor Grégory Doucet on Saturday before a march in tribute to radical far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
"First and foremost, it is the city of Jean Moulin, the capital of the Resistance," he said to the press, adding that national and municipal police will ensure vigilance in his city.
Watch: France on edge ahead of far-right rally
Some two to three thousand people are expected to attend a march Saturday in Lyon for a far-right activist killed last week. With ultra-right groups expected to attend the march, tensions are high with President Emmanuel Macron urging calm. FRANCE 24's Olivia Bizot reports from Lyon.
France's radical right uses Deranque’s death to target far-left
Quentin Deranque’s death has triggered a storm of recriminations, mostly blaming the far-left France Unbowed party and its leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Among the suspects is the parliamentary aide of a France Unbowed lawmaker who set up the anti-fascist group The Young Guard.
France Unbowed’s opponents accuse it of fomenting violence and tensions with its combative far-left politics.
Mélenchon has condemned the violence and insisted that his party bore no blame for the tragedy.
The France Unbowed leader stood for the presidency in 2012, 2017 and 2022, but failed to advance to the decisive runoff round. He is preparing for another expected run next year, when Macron’s second and last term ends.
France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonise France Unbowed. Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party.
The National Rally has worked for years to shed its reputation as being racist and anti-Semitic and to present itself as a bulwark of institutional credibility.
In a message to party officials before Saturday's march, Bardella urged them to avoid the nationwide rallies, where potential confrontations could reinforce the negative image it is trying to shed.
"The far left's desire for confrontation with these gatherings appears undiminished. Some organisers, undeniably linked to the ultra-right and whom we refuse to associate with... are also seeking confrontation," he wrote.
"We have paid a dignified tribute to Quentin and are fully assuming the political role that the French people - shocked and outraged by this tragedy - expect from us."
He said the killing allows the National Rally to say: "'We respect institutions. There are people who are afraid of us coming to power; they kill our supporters.'"
Rhone authorities will not tolerate 'any incidents' during the march, prefect says
The prefect of Rhone, the east-central French administrative department of which Lyon is capital, has said authorities will not tolerate “any incidents” during the rally for far-right activist Quentin Deranque.
Speaking at a press conference ahead of the march, Rhone Prefect Fabienne Buccio said authorities “will not tolerate any incidents within the procession” nor “on the fringes of this march”.
Security measures, which have been stepped up for the march, include additional personnel and two drones, said Buccio which “will remain in place, including in the evening,” she added.

Iran expert Ross Harrison: 'Cutting off the head of the snake' would not bring down the regime

Ross Harrison, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute and author of Decoding Iran's Foreign Policy (2025), says in an interview that US airstrikes in Iran now appear inevitable, but the scenario of a swift intervention like the one seen in Venezuela in January is unrealistic. Even if Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei were to be targeted, "cutting off the head of the snake" would not be enough to bring down the regime, he argues.
A second round of negotiations concluded on February 13 in Geneva between the Iranians and the Americans. According to the negotiators, progress was made. But an "armada," in the words of Donald Trump, is positioned off the coast of Iran, ready to strike the country. Are these negotiations being taken seriously on both the American and the Iranian sides?
The term “negotiation” is not appropriate to describe the situation. It is more of an ultimatum, and the Iranians likely see it even as a trap on the part of the United States. Iranian regime officials learned lessons from the 12-day war [in June 2025, when Israel, backed by the United States, struck Iranian nuclear and military facilities]. The strikes were launched while negotiations were still underway.

Puberty blocker trial for children paused over long-term safety fears
- A clinical trial for puberty blockers for children has been paused following concerns raised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
- The MHRA warned that the trial should have a minimum age limit of 14, citing an "unquantified risk" of "long-term biological harms" for younger participants.
- Recruitment for the trial, sponsored by King's College London, will not commence until the MHRA's concerns are resolved through discussions next week.
- The pause comes amidst legal action and strong opposition from public figures, including author JK Rowling, who labelled the trial "an unethical experiment on children".
- The Department of Health and Social Care confirmed the trial will only proceed if expert scientific and clinical evidence concludes it is both safe and necessary for children and young people.

Hong Kong to spend HK$6.8 billion buying back fire-ravaged Tai Po flats
Deputy financial secretary says government offering HK$8,000 or HK$10,500 per square foot and will draw HK$4 billion from public funds
Deputy Financial Secretary Michael Wong Wai-lun unveiled the plan on Saturday, ruling out on-site redevelopment of Wang Fuk Court and adding that authorities were inclined to demolish seven of the estate’s eight buildings and redevelop the site as parks or other social facilities.
Wong said the cash buyout and “flat-for-flat” exchanges would provide the fastest and most flexible solution, while authorities would handle post-acquisition matters at Wang Fuk Court, including legal and insurance issues.
“The Wang Fuk Court fire is a special case of an exceptional nature. This one-off arrangement will not serve as a precedent,” he said.
Wong added that the Tai Po fire was unprecedented, noting that displaced residents had suffered significant losses and faced immense challenges in their daily lives, warranting understanding and support from society.
He also stressed the need to buy back the flats, saying no effective market mechanism could address the challenges or help the affected households.
“Without strong government intervention, flat owners would find it extremely difficult to secure buyers for their homes, and the money they invested over the years could go up in smoke,” the deputy financial secretary said.

Turkish modular buildings firm Dorce prepares for Libya energy growth after new tenders

Turkish modular construction company Dorce is seeking to channel its field experience in Libya into new energy projects after that country reopened oil and gas exploration tenders for the first time in nearly 17 years.
Serhat Polatdemir, the overseas tender manager, said renewed activity in Libya’s energy sector has shifted attention to Turkish companies with an established presence in the country.
“Dorce previously delivered projects in Kufra, and we are ready to transfer our expertise in fast-installation, mobile living spaces adapted to desert conditions to new projects,” Polatdemir was quoted in a statement by Dorce.
Highlighting that Dorce’s previous experience in Libya is expected to serve as a reference for the new period, he said about energy developments, “time, logistics and mobilisation capability are decisive.”
“The camps we build in desert conditions are not only accommodation areas but also include the technical infrastructure required to ensure uninterrupted operations,” he noted.
Major energy firms flock to Libya
Libya’s National Oil Corporation recently concluded its first oil and gas tender in nearly two decades. Türkiye’s state-run Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) secured exploration licenses in two offshore and onshore blocks.
Major energy companies, including Spain’s Repsol and Italy’s ENI, are preparing to operate in the Sirte and Murzuq basins, increasing demand for infrastructure and workforce accommodation in remote desert areas.
Dorce, which has operated in Libya for years, completed workforce accommodation camps in the southeastern Kufra region, one of the harshest areas of the Sahara Desert.
The company described the project as “a pilot model for upcoming oil investments.”
The Kufra camp was designed as a self-sufficient modular settlement, integrating not only housing units but also the technical systems required for pipeline operations. Single-story prefabricated units were installed on a concrete block placement system suited for desert terrain, allowing the structures to tolerate uneven ground and to be dismantled and relocated if needed.
Polatdemir said the main challenge in Libya’s energy basins is maintaining operational continuity under extreme desert conditions.
Day-to-night temperature swings, sandstorms and high wind loads were key considerations in structural design, said Polatdemir, noting the use of specialised insulation materials and reinforced steel systems to ensure durability and low maintenance requirements.
In remote energy fields far from urban utility networks, camps must operate independently, added Polatdemir.
The Kufra project integrated clean water storage tanks, on-site distribution systems, container-based wastewater and septic treatment units, as well as dedicated generator rooms and power distribution panels to secure energy continuity.
“We provide comprehensive solutions in critical areas such as water supply, waste management and energy provision,” he added.

“On February 20, Russians wounded four residents of the Donetsk region,” Filashkin wrote.
It is noted that the total number of Russian victims in the Donetsk region (4,056 dead and 8,917 wounded) is provided without taking into account the temporarily occupied Mariupol and Volnovakha.
As reported by Ukrinform, Russian troops wounded two residents of the Donetsk region on February 18.

'Green light to violence': Anti-racism commissioner denounces Hanson's remarks

In brief
- One Nation leader Pauline Hanson said there were "no good Muslims" in an interview with Sky News on Monday.
- Race discrimination commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said he was deeply concerned by her comments.
Australia's race discrimination commissioner has denounced One Nation leader Pauline Hanson's remarks about Muslims, saying they gave a "green light to violence".
Hanson said there were "no good Muslims" in an interview with Sky News on Monday, days before the start of Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar.
She later partially walked back her comments, which the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said had been the subject of criminal complaints.
In an interview with SBS News, race discrimination commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said he was deeply concerned by Hanson's remarks.
"When a public figure, a politician, demonises and dehumanises a whole group of people, that's a green light to violence from others," he said.
"It emboldened others to act violently towards that group."
The commissioner said there was a link between dehumanising language and violence.
"It's making out that a group of people are somehow lesser or don't belong or are bad, and that's exactly what she's doing," he said.
"That dehumanisation is what then incites or gives permission for violence to occur."
On Wednesday, Hanson offered a conditional apology before singling out the western Sydney suburb of Lakemba, which has a high Muslim population.
"If I've offended anyone out there that doesn't believe in Sharia law or multiple marriages or wants to bring ISIS brides in or people from Gaza who believes in the caliphate ... then I apologise to you for my comment," she said.
"But in general, that's what they want: a world caliphate and I'm not going to apologise."
"And I've been there myself in Lakemba ... you feel unwanted, you're not wanted to be there."
The Muslim community in the area has been on high alert after a threat letter was sent to Lakemba Mosque, the third it has received in a month.
It included a cartoon pig and contained calls to kill or deport Muslims, referencing an Australian convicted terrorist who killed 51 Muslims in Christchurch in 2019.
Canterbury-Bankstown mayor Bilal El-Hayek, representing Lakemba, called on Hanson to be under hate speech laws.
"There is a specific reference made of pubic incitement of hated, discrimination or violence against particular groups based on race, religion or gender," he told ABC radio on Friday.
"Clearly, her latest target was Muslim people and I have no doubt that her remarks will incite someone."
'Long history of Islamophobia'
Sivaraman said that Hanson's comments were "not a novelty".
"They are part of a long history of Islamophobia, and it's time that Senator Hanson is held accountable for her actions. We can't simply treat it as something new," he said.
Sivaraman also criticised Hanson's calls for immigration to be cut, saying they had "xenophobic undertones".
"There's nothing wrong with having a debate about migration. It's a genuine policy issue, but there is plenty of evidence to show that completely stopping migration would be absolutely disastrous for the Australian economy," he said.
"I think that's just one example where a policy that gets put forward that is populist and carries racist undertones should be challenged."
The AFP on Friday said it had "received reports of a crime" in relation to Hanson's remarks and further information would be provided at an appropriate time.
Several public figures have also criticised her comments, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who said it "legitimises" violence towards Muslims.
Hanson was suspended and censured for a week last year after she wore a burqa into the Senate, repeating a stunt she pulled in 2017.

At a meeting with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi, the permanent representatives of Russia, China, and Iran emphasized the importance of a political and diplomatic settlement of the issues around Tehran’s nuclear dossier, Russian envoy to international organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told Izvestia.
According to the newspaper, on February 18, the permanent representatives of Russia, China, and Iran in Vienna held a meeting with Grossi. "Particular emphasis was placed on the need for an exclusively political and diplomatic settlement of all existing problems in this context (the issue of the Iranian nuclear dossier). This kind of cooperation between the three countries' diplomatic missions will continue," the diplomat said.
On February 17, the second round of Oman-mediated talks between the US and Iran on the nuclear dossier took place in Geneva. According to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, the parties reached a mutual understanding on several issues that could be included in the draft of a future nuclear program deal.

Tucker Carlson falsely claims Herzog visited Epstein island in interview with US envoy

Right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson falsely claimed that President Isaac Herzog visited Jeffrey Epstein’s private island during an interview filmed in Israel and released Friday.
Carlson, a prominent critic of Israel on the American right, traveled to Israel this week to interview U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee. The interview was published on Carlson’s podcast and quickly drew hundreds of thousands of views online.
During the conversation, Carlson pressed Huckabee about supposed visits by Herzog to Epstein’s island, despite there being no evidence that Herzog had any connection to Epstein or ever visited his property.
“The current president of Israel, whom I know you know, apparently was at ‘pedo island.’ That’s what it says,” Carlson said. “Still-living, high-level Israeli officials are directly implicated in Epstein’s life, if not his crimes, so I think you’d be following this.”
Former prime minister Ehud Barak had social ties with Epstein, but there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Barak. Herzog’s name appears in the Epstein files only in reference to news articles that were included in Epstein’s email correspondence. There is no indication of a personal relationship between the two men.
Huckabee said he was unaware of any such connection.
“I was not aware there was any connection with President Herzog. I would be surprised to hear that,” Huckabee said.
“I don’t know that I’ve heard the current president of Israel respond to it, but he is listed as a visitor to ‘pedo island,’ so that’s kind of a big deal,” Carlson replied, criticizing Huckabee for not questioning Herzog about the issue.
“This is the first I’ve heard of this, so why do you expect me to have knowledge like that?” Huckabee responded.
Following the release of the Epstein files last month, an AI-generated image falsely depicting Herzog with Epstein circulated widely online amid a wave of disinformation and conspiracy theories, including antisemitic narratives involving Jews and Israel.
Although Carlson’s claims lack evidence, viewers of the interview were not informed that the allegations were baseless. More than 600,000 people viewed the video on YouTube within hours of its release, and it was widely shared across social media platforms.
Carlson also asserted, without evidence, that it was “very clear” Epstein was affiliated with Mossad. A key source cited in the Epstein files who alleged such ties has been described as a discredited fraudster and Holocaust denier.
After the interview aired and Huckabee learned that the allegations against Herzog were false, he wrote on X: “His allegations against Israeli officials could be the stuff of libel lawsuits. It was hard to follow Tucker’s line of questioning.”
Claims of ‘interrogation’ at the airport
Carlson’s visit to Israel also generated controversy after he alleged that Israeli security officials subjected members of his team to hostile questioning.
Carlson did not leave Ben Gurion Airport during his trip, but claimed that two producers were targeted for “interrogation.” Huckabee and the Israel Airports Authority rejected the accusation.
In the introduction to the interview, before Huckabee joined him, Carlson said Israeli officials held his team’s passports and that his producers were “called into rooms and given the third degree.”
Carlson said security personnel asked, “What did you say to the US ambassador?”
“They’re doing like an intel op and humiliation exercise on my producer. This isn’t security,” he said.
“The interrogator is holding his passport in his hand as he’s asking these questions,” Carlson said. “Some thug is demanding details of that conversation.”
“It’s a police state, it’s a surveillance state. You go to Israel, and they put software on your phone. Everybody knows this. They’re constantly spying on you,” he added. There is no evidence that Israeli authorities install spyware on visitors’ phones.
Questioning travelers at the airport while reviewing passports is standard procedure in Israel.
Carlson also claimed that Israel deliberately attacked the USS Liberty in 1967, a longstanding conspiracy theory on the US far right. He alleged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had threatened his family “because he believes in blood guilt,” and described Israel as “probably the most violent country on earth.”
Throughout both the introduction and the interview, Carlson portrayed Israel as exerting outsized influence over US policy and dragging the United States into wars, echoing longstanding antisemitic tropes about hidden Jewish power.
“Americans in the United States, can you be sure that your government will take your side over the Israeli government? No, of course not. They will always take the Israeli government’s side over yours and that’s the core problem,” he said.
“If you criticize Israel in your country, your government will censor you,” he added, despite the fact that Carlson and other prominent figures routinely criticize Israel publicly without facing government censorship.
Huckabee and Carlson remained largely cordial but frequently disagreed on basic facts.
As Carlson warned that Israel was endangering US troops, Huckabee noted that American forces have never fought on Israel’s behalf. Carlson responded by repeating the unsubstantiated claim that the Iraq War was fought at Israel’s urging and that Israel is pushing the US toward war with Iran.
“I don’t think that it’s at all accurate to even intimate that tiny, little Israel is pushing the US into something it does not want to do,” Huckabee said.
“Prime Minister Netanyahu has way more influence over American foreign policy than Americans do,” Carlson replied.
Carlson also questioned Israel’s right to exist, launching into a meandering discussion about indigeneity that touched on whether Jews are an ethnicity or religion, ancient history and genetics. Huckabee said several times he could not follow Carlson’s reasoning.
Some of Carlson’s arguments mirrored rhetoric more commonly associated with the far left, including accusations that Israel murders journalists, commits genocide and blocks Christian Palestinians from accessing holy sites. He also criticized US financial aid to Israel.
The convergence of such rhetoric from both extremes reflects what is often described as the horseshoe theory of politics, in which the far right and far left adopt similar positions, particularly regarding Jews and Israel.

Three people killed as US military strikes another alleged narcotics boat in the Pacific Ocean

The US military said it targeted a boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean late on Friday which its intelligence identified as a drug-trafficking vessel, killing three people on board. The US Southern Command said the boat was using known narco-trafficking maritime routes.
The US said its military has carried out another strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean late on Friday, killing three people.
The US Southern Command announced in a post on X that it had conducted a “lethal kinetic strike” on a vessel its intelligence had identified as a narcotics trafficking boat “transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific”.
“Three male narco-terrorists were killed during this action. No US military forces were harmed.”
The strike was part of Operation Southern Spear, a controversial initiative launched by US President Donald Trump to combat the illegal flow of narcotics into the United States.
Many boats have been targeted and struck in dozens of operations spanning months, which have killed at least 148 people in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean.
Many have questioned the legality of these operations, which often target vessels in open and international waters, though the Trump administration has defended its initiative, saying it only targets narco-terrorists and does so legally.
Trump has said Washington is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narco-terrorists.”
Many have also questioned the rationale, as one of the main substances plaguing the US for years has been fentanyl, which is typically trafficked into the US over land from Mexico where it is produced, using chemicals imported from China and India.
The operations started in the last quarter of 2025, particularly in waters near Venezuela, leading to tensions between Washington and Caracas, with Trump having accused his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro of being a narco-terrorist himself.
The standoff culminated with the US staging a stunning military operation in Caracas early in January, which captured Maduro and his wife and extradited them to New York, where they face charges of narco-trafficking.
The US military has however continued to strike boats in the weeks following the operation.
The White House says narcotics have become a rampant issue domestically, particularly affecting the country’s youth, and is an issue that has been neglected by previous administrations.
Trump says the operations will continue until all transnational criminal networks responsible for supplying drugs across the border are dismantled and no longer pose a threat to national security.

Russia has lost around 1,258,890 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported on Feb. 21.
The number includes 1,010 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, while Ukrainian forces also downed a helicopter.
According to the report, Russia has lost 11,685 tanks, 24,063 armored combat vehicles, 79,295 vehicles and fuel tanks, 37,429 artillery systems, 1,651 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,303 air defense systems, 435 aircraft, 348 helicopters, 140,408 operational-tactical drones, 29 ships and boats, and two submarines.
Ukraine's General Staff has not revealed its own losses during the full-scale invasion, citing operational secrecy.
Ukrainian officials rarely disclose figures, but President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action since the beginning of the full-scale war, in addition to many more classified as missing in action (MIA).

While Ukrainian officials rarely disclose figures, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in action since the beginning of the full-scale war, in addition to many more classified as missing in action (MIA). The intensity of Russian drones and fighting has made it difficult for Ukraine to retrieve the bodies of fallen soldiers, which are needed for DNA confirmation.
Independent Western think-tank reports agree that the Russian casualties significantly surpass Ukraine’s losses, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimating the ratio to be “roughly 2.5:1 or 2:1.”
A January 2026 CSIS report said Ukraine has likely suffered between 500,000 and 600,000 casualties from February 2022 to December 2025, of which between 100,000 to 140,000 are thought to be killed in action (KIA).

Trump to make three-day visit to China next month, White House says
The three-day trip, at Beijing’s invitation, comes more than eight years after Trump’s first visit to China during his first stint as president.
Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2, the White House has said, in what will be the first official visit to Beijing by a United States president since Trump’s last trip there in 2017.
The dates, confirmed by a White House official on Friday, come as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have respectively described “excellent” and “good communication” between the two countries in recent months.

“That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump said on Thursday of the planned trip.
“We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China,” Trump said.
The announcement of Trump’s China visit came shortly before the US Supreme Court on Friday struck down the tariffs that Trump had imposed on countries around the world, in a tactic the US president has openly used to influence other countries to support his policies.
Tariffs will likely be on the agenda in Beijing, as will China’s response to the US’s trade threats, including no longer buying soybeans, previously the top US export to China.
Beijing has already hosted a number of other Western leaders in recent months, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who touted new trade deals and a lifting of Canada’s ban on buying Chinese-made electric cars during his visit.
China’s increasing global exports of electric vehicles come as Beijing has invested heavily in new technologies and renewable energy in recent years, potentially further setting it apart from the US, where Trump is doubling down on fossil fuels.
Washington also continues to provide weapons sales and other support to Taiwan, which Beijing has promised to unify with mainland China.
This will be Trump’s first trip to China since the COVID-19 pandemic, which the then-US president labelled as the “Chinese virus”. Trump then downplayed the virus’s potential consequences in the US, where more than one million people died during the pandemic.
Since reopening its borders in January 2023, following strict self-imposed isolation during the pandemic, China has seemingly increased its efforts to engage with the outside world in recent months.
In addition to hosting Western politicians, China has also opened its doors to popular US live streamers such as Hasan Piker and Darren Watkins Jr, also known as Speed, while also attracting US citizens to its social media apps.

How Rap and Hip-Hop are transforming the French and their everyday language
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-21
07:13:38 UTC
16:13:38 KST

On International Mother Language Day, we look at how rap and hip-hop artists are mixing languages and spreading a vernacular that captures the contemporary Francophone world: multi-ethnic, multilingual, and shaped by migration.
Over the steady beat of the cymbals, rap duo Lunatic find their pace and announce themselves on their debut track “Le Crime Paie”: “Wesh, wesh, écoute fils.”
That was in 1996.
Nearly three decades later, on the track "Bolide Noir", London rapper Central Cee briefly laments, “I'm in Paris, tryna drop rizz, but they don't understand 'cos they're speaking French. Why does she keep saying wesh?”
In the years between these tracks, “wesh” — derived from Darija, a dialect of Arabic from North Africa, and often used to emphasise statements or greet others — has solidified its place in spoken French. A word that was initially spread by diasporic communities living in France and was frequently heard in banlieues on the outskirts of Paris is now ubiquitous on the streets of French cities and recorded in the Le Robert dictionary.
“Wesh” is not the only word to have entered the French lexicon in this way. At the intersection of languages, musicians in France and Francophone Africa are penning a new identity for the French language — one that exists on the borders of cultures and is shaped through a history of colonisation, migration, and music.
The influence of Paris’ banlieue on the language of French rap and, by extension, French slang is unmistakable. Chart-topping artists like PNL and Kery James draw from their experiences in the French capital’s multi-ethnic and neglected suburbs not only in the stories they narrate, but also in the language they use to narrate them.
Verlan — a linguistic process that often alters the meaning of standard French terms — was used in the suburbs before making its way into widely-spoken French. Its vocabulary borrows from various languages, such as Arabic or Romani, according to a paper published in HAL Open Science. PNL’s tracks, in particular, are peppered with Arabic words within French sentences.
“Verlan is seen as a tool to create a sense of belonging in a society dominated by fixed representations, allowing immigrant descendants to finally construct positive hybrid identities,” the paper explains. Living in a hotbed of linguistic remixing and experimentation, artists have popularized a vernacular that can communicate their intersectional identities: multilingual and multi-ethnic; diasporic and French.
But the French language is not spoken, tended to, and expanded solely in France. More than 50% of French speakers globally live in Africa and the Middle East, according to the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie. French colonialism carried and imposed its language on indigenous communities and stigmatized local languages — a policy that carried over post-independence in many former colonies, according to a paper on language policies in French colonies.
While the French language retains memories of a history of colonialism, it is still a fixture of daily life in postcolonial societies such as those in Africa.
“Language is a delicate issue in Africa,” Jean-Martial Kouamé, professor of linguistics and director of the Institute of Applied Linguistics at the Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny, told L'actualité. “Some see French as a vehicle for postcolonial influence, but for most people, it’s simply an African language.”
Over the years, the straitjacket around the usage and education of French has been undone, cut up, and refashioned: in Abidjan, Ivorians are combining the structure of French with Ivorian slang, or nouchi, to reinvent the language. Ivorian French has developed a strong kinship with nouchi over 30 years of language mixing.
This hybrid language is widely spoken and resonates with the public.“We’ve tried to rap in pure French, but nobody was listening to us,” Dofy, an Ivorian hip-hop artist, explained in the New York Times. “So we create words from our own realities, and then they spread.”
They spread, in fact, to French-speakers far beyond Côte D’Ivoire: the nouchi words “s’enjailler” (to enjoy) and “boucantier” (party animal) became ubiquitous on city streets in France and social media, ultimately cementing their place in the French dictionary Petit Larousse.
While the mixing of languages has expanded the way French is spoken, performed, and posted online, institutions like the Académie Française are slow to accept this changing linguistic landscape. Verlan, for instance, has been largely overlooked by the Académie, as explored in a paper on alternative linguistics practices.
When French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura performed at the opening ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics, it was a public recognition of the intersectional identities of the French population. Nakamura’s songs often incorporate expressions from other languages and urban slang into French lyrics, and many saw the performance and particularly its language as a reflection of contemporary France.
As French rap and hip-hop become more popular, their language finds its way beyond the Francophone world — most often through collaborations between English-language artists like Dave and Central Cee who have an established global following.
“A language that renews itself, that sees new words born within it, is a language that's doing well,” linguist Aurore Vincenti told Franceinfo. As artists capture the diverse sounds of the Francophone world in their music, they expand the scope of the French language — which could be vital to its future.

Ukraine offers EU Odesa-Brody pipeline as alternative to damaged Druzhba system

Ukraine offers EU Odesa-Brody pipeline as alternative to damaged Druzhba system
Kyiv has proposed that the EU use alternative elements of Ukraine's oil transport network, particularly the Odesa-Brody pipeline, to deliver crude to Hungary and Slovakia following damage to the Druzhba oil pipeline caused by a Russian attack.
Source: a letter from Ukraine's mission to the European Union dated 20 February and addressed to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Energy, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Until repairs to the Druzhba oil pipeline are completed, Ukraine is offering the EU the possibility of receiving oil via the Odesa-Brody route.
The document noted that significant damage had been inflicted on elements of Ukraine's oil transport system, including technological and auxiliary equipment on the Druzhba pipeline, as a result of deliberate attacks carried out by Russia, the aggressor state, on 27 January.
Ukrainian diplomats informed the European Commission that experts are currently conducting a detailed technical inspection of the damaged equipment and assessing the technical feasibility and conditions for the prompt restoration of oil transport through the pipeline.
The letter added that efforts are continuing to survey the damaged elements, stabilise the system's technical condition and deal with the aftermath of the Russian strike. It also emphasised that the uninterrupted and stable functioning of the oil transport infrastructure is only possible if Russia stops its large-scale missile and drone attacks targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure.
It highlighted that Ukrainians are forced to conduct emergency repair work under a constant threat of airstrikes, risking their lives.
Ukraine suggested to the EU that, to ensure secure oil supplies to European countries, particularly Hungary and Slovakia, they consider the possibility of using Ukraine's existing oil transport infrastructure. It added that such logistics could be organised either via Ukraine's pipeline network or by sea, with subsequent transshipment at seaports and onward transport through the Odesa-Brody pipeline to EU member states.
Previously:
- Hungary has stated that it is blocking a €90 billion EU loan for Ukraine until Kyiv restores the transit of Russian oil to Europe via the Druzhba pipeline.
- The documents on the €90 billion package were planned to be approved by the Council of the European Union and signed by the European Parliament on 24 February, marking the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Background: The European Council agreed to provide Ukraine with a €90 billion loan for 2026-2027, based on EU borrowing on capital markets and backed by EU budget reserves. However, Hungary, Slovakia and Czechia have refused to take part in the scheme.

Bilingual mums' bond with children is strong despite switching languages, study

International Mother Language Day: Speaking and playing in a second language has no impact on mother-child brain synchrony, a new study has found.
Talking in a second language doesn’t affect neural synchrony between bilingual mothers and children, a new study has found.
The researchers analysed whether the language used between mothers and children in bilingual families affected their interactions. They compared situations where they interacted in the mother’s native language with those in which they talked in English to see if multilingualism could be a barrier to parent-child communication and bonding.
The study, published in Frontiers in Cognition, found that this synchrony doesn’t seem to get lost even when changing languages.
“Here we show that the brains of bilingual mums and their kids stay just as ‘in sync’ through neural synchrony irrespective of whether they play in the mum’s native language or in an acquired second language,” said Efstratia Papoutselou, first author of the study and research fellow at the University of Nottingham.
Neural synchrony is the simultaneous activity of neural networks across the brains of people who are socially interacting. It is thought to be key to healthy bonding between parents and children.
How was the study done?
The research team analysed fifteen mother-child couples. Mothers were all non-native English speakers but proficient in it as a second language.
Children were bilingual in their mother’s language and English.
For the study, they took part in a 45-minute playing session, divided into three different parts: at first, they interacted in the mother’s native language, then they continued in English, and finally, they played independently in silence.
Both mother and child wore a cap that measured changes in the oxygen concentration across the brain’s blood vessels.
They found that neural synchrony was stronger during interactive play than when mother and child were playing independently.
Synchrony was especially strong in the brain’s frontal cortex, where decision-making, planning, reasoning, and emotions take place.
The authors concluded that talking in a second language did not affect the mother’s ability to synchronise with the child during playtime.
Does bilingualism affect our interactions?
While the study found that switching languages does not disrupt neural synchrony between mothers and children, broader research shows that using a second language shapes how people communicate.
In Europe, three out of five people can have a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue, according to the latest Eurobarometer data from 2024, a 3-point increase since 2012.
Research found that for adults who have learned a second language later in life, interaction may differ from their mother tongue, especially in emotionally charged or cognitively demanding contexts.
“Second-language speakers often report a sense of emotional distancing when using their non-native language, which may influence how they express affection, discipline, or empathy in parent-child interactions,” the authors wrote.
They concluded that future research should look at families with different levels of language proficiency, including when a parent is less fluent in the second language, or where the child is not bilingual from birth.
They added that it would also be important to analyse other types of interactions outside the family, such as child-teachers or child-strangers.

China showcases humanoid martial arts robots: Should Europe be worried?

As Beijing pushes forward in robotics, which it displayed at the Lunar New Year performance, a bigger question is emerging: how advanced are these systems really, and should Europe be concerned?
China's annual Lunar New Year's Eve spectacular made headlines this year as humanoid robots stole the show, performing coordinated martial arts and parkour routines.
It marked several groundbreaking achievements and is a bold demonstration of the country's rapid technological advancement.
According to a video posted by CCTV, two dozen robots performed the first continuous freestyle table-vaulting parkour, the first aerial flip, continuous single-leg flips, a two-step wall-assisted backflip, and the first 7.5-rotation Airflare grand spin.
China has been accelerating efforts to build more capable AI-powered robots with less human input.
The robots have come a long way since last year’s gala, wherehumanoids performed a wobbly folk dance with handkerchiefs. This year’s machines looked notably more stable, signalling a clear step forward.
What this means beyond the gala
But beyond the spectacle, questions remain: how advanced are these robots and should their development raise concerns?
Companies globally are testing humanoids in factories and warehouses, and some firms are positioning them for future home use.
Defence experts say such machines could eventually have military applications.
“There is likely room for robots in the shape of humans and animals in military and security organisations. Especially if they are to interact with structures built for humans, like cars, stairs, and doors,” Hans Liwång, a professor in systems science for defence and security at the Swedish Defence University, told Euronews Next.
He cautioned that real-world deployment is far more complex than a staged performance. In military settings, he said, the robot’s shape matters far less than whether it has sufficiently “well-developed logic” to operate in an unpredictable environment.
Liwång similarly cautioned against reading too much into high-profile demonstrations, as they can also be viewed through the lens of state propaganda.
“Putting on a rehearsed, preplanned, and controlled show does not tell us that much about the state of the technology. Such shows are designed to impress, and therefore likely overstates the capability of the technology,” he said.
Can Europe keep pace?
While Europe does not need to be alarmed, it does need to pay attention, Liwång said.
“Europe needs to be informed about international development. We need to learn from others, not build from scratch. We need to learn from the efforts put into this development and from the technical development”.
His comments come as the humanoid robotics race increasingly appears to be led by China and the United States.
Analysts say China’s advantage lies largely in manufacturing scale and supply chain integration.
The country has built what experts describe as a near vertically integrated robotics value chain, supported by strong government backing, allowing firms to scale production quickly and push prices lower.
Unitree Robotics, whose machines featured prominently at China’s Spring Festival Gala, advertises a base price of $13,500 (about €11,280) for its G1 humanoid robot.
Tesla has yet to announce a commercial price for Optimus. During a January 2025 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said production costs could fall below $20,000 (about €16,700) if annual output reaches one million units, suggesting prices may remain higher until large-scale manufacturing is achieved.
According to a 2024 report from the International Federation of Robotics, a global industry association headquartered in Germany, China remains the world’s largest industrial robot market and accounted for more than half of all robot installations globally in 2024.

‘Clean power everywhere’: How space-based solar could help us go beyond net zero targets

Once considered a dystopian fantasy, space-based solar could soon transform the renewable energy sector.
In 1941, two astronauts began the seemingly impossible feat of training a robot to operate a solar energy station in space, one capable of beaming power across the Solar System.
Of course, this was purely fiction – the dystopian plot of sci-fi writer Isaac Asimov’s short story ‘Reason’. However, less than two decades later, real-life scientists started to wonder whether renewables really could be deployed in outer space.
Last year, researchers at King’s College London found that, by 2050, solar panels in space could reduce Europe’s need for land-based renewable energy by 80 per cent. But, is it really that simple?
What is space-based solar?
Space-based solar power (SBSP) systems comprise a constellation of very large satellites in a high-earth orbit, where the sun is visible over 99 per cent of the time.
These satellites would collect solar power using mirror-like reflectors and beam it to a secure fixed point on Earth (without the help of any robots). Here, it would be converted to electricity and delivered to an energy grid so it could be sent to homes and businesses.
A new study commissioned by the UK’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) suggests that small-scale SBSP could become cost-competitive with other commercial power sources as early as 2040, especially if connected to the grid through existing infrastructure at offshore wind farms, for example.
Is space-based solar the ticket to ending fossil fuels?
The world is dragging its heels when it comes to moving away from fossil fuels, despite the boom in renewables.
Transitioning away from oil and gas became a flashpoint discussion at last year’s COP30 climate summit in Belém, despite not being on the official agenda. It saw more than 90 nations backing the idea of a roadmap that allows each country to set out its own targets to phase out fossil fuels – but all mention of this was scrubbed from the final deal.
Still, for the first time ever, wind and solar generated more electricity than fossil fuels in the EU in 2025 – while fossil power has declined from 36.7 per cent to 29 per cent of the bloc’s electricity mix.
“All renewable energy technologies will have a part to play in tackling climate change, especially as energy demand is expected to double by 2050,” Dr Adam Law, a research associate in the Centre for Renewable Energy Systems Technology (CREST) at Loughborough University, tells Euronews Green.
Renewables face intermittency problems for a plethora of reasons, including weather conditions and Europe’s outdated grid. It’s why Britain wasted a staggering £1.47 billion (approximately €1.67bn) by turning off wind turbines (curtailment) and paying gas plants to switch on.
“SBSP benefits from there being a lot more sunlight available in space – 1,367 W/m2 of uninterrupted sunlight, compared to a maximum of 1,000 W/m2 at the equator and an average of about 100 W/m2 in the UK, and satellites in the right orbit see the sun almost all the time,” Law adds.
The true cost of space-based solar
On the ground, solar is considered the world’s cheapest power source. In the sunniest countries, solar costs as little as €0.023 to produce one unit of power - and installation is much cheaper (and quicker) compared to renewables like wind.
But taking the tech out into space won’t be cheap. Recent reports suggest the development of SBSP is anticipated to require €15.8 billion of research and development over four phases to achieve the first gigawatt-scale prototype in-orbit.
“The scale of launching and building these structures in space is immense, so initial costs will be high,” says Law.
However, launch costs have come down “dramatically” to help make SBSP more economically feasible. Law says this is mainly driven by SpaceX and the advent of reusable rockets.
“Driving these costs down is key to realising SBSP,” he adds, noting that making solar cells both affordable and radiation-resistant will be another crucial factor.
While many startups such as Space Solar in the UK and Virtus Solis in the US are developing SBSP systems thanks to government and private funding, maintaining them will also be no easy feat – especially if things go wrong.
“There is the potential for increased orbital debris, so systems will have to be designed with these factors in mind, for example, by using highly modular designs,” Law adds.
The safety of the power beam is another risk to consider. But Law argues its intensity is low enough to prevent harm to humans and wildlife.
Overall, bringing SBSP to life “will be difficult, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth doing,” he adds.
Of course, sending satellites into space also poses environmental concerns.
In 2024, the American space agency NASA warned that SBSP may produce greenhouse gas emissions comparable to existing renewable energy systems – but fewer emissions than fossil fuels.
Is space-based solar a security risk?
SBSP systems could easily become a target for hostile states who want to damage, degrade or deny a rival’s ability to deliver power. Even plans to construct a fleet of offshore windfarms in the North Sea that connect to multiple European countries have sparked concerns of being “attractive for sabotage”.
While fossil fuel plants have long been considered vulnerable to attacks, a 2023 investigation by public broadcasters in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland discovered that Russia had a programme to sabotage wind farms and communication cables in the North Sea.
It found Russia has a fleet of vessels that are disguised as fishing trawlers and research boats that are carrying out underwater surveillance and mapping key sites for possible sabotage.
“Like other critical national infrastructure, it is a tempting target for cybercriminals, state-sponsored actors, and hacktivists seeking to cause disruption or gain geopolitical advantage,” says Frazer-Nash, a consultancy company that released a report on SBSP’s security challenges last year.
The report highlights the need to design solar power satellites with "inherent security and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies” from the outset.
This includes building multinational partnerships and agreements to share energy and enhance security, continuous threat monitoring, and ensuring supply chains demonstrate a “robust” cybersecurity arrangement.
“Failing to address key areas of security and risk in the early development stages could limit its tantalising potential before it’s begun,” Frazer-Nash states.

A flurry of new collaborations offer chic yet comfortable options for your next travel day.
While the debate around what to wear on flights never truly dies, a campaign from the US transport secretary around ‘dressing with respect’ late last year certainly reignited the conversation.
Beyond breaking rules around nudity or offensive slogans, there’s no real wrong answer.
Having said that, the rise of luxury hotel branded merchandise might be providing an answer we didn’t know we needed.
Certainly not a new phenomenon, hotel chains have been collaborating with sportswear and other clothing brands for several years now, but recent months have seen a flurry of new options that might just be perfect for your next flight.
Raffles x Printemps
Singaporean hotel chain Raffles is renowned for its butler service, and the name of its new collection – The Butler Did It – is a playful nod to its signature offering.
The new collection, available exclusively at Printemps Paris and New York, has plenty of cosy planewear options, including T-shirts, polos and cashmere jumpers, as well as some pieces you absolutely should not be donning for an international flight, like velvet smoking jackets and pyjamas.
If you can’t find anything suitable among the collection, fear not, because the brand has said that the launch is a “preview of a broader ready-to-wear and home offering” set to be revealed this autumn.
Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok x Sporty & Rich
One of two flagship hotels under the Mandarin Oriental brand, the property on Bangkok’s Chao Phraya River first began welcoming guests back in 1876.
To celebrate 150 years of what was then known as The Oriental, the hotel has collaborated with Sporty & Rich to create co-branded T-shirts, crew necks and sweatpants that are perfect for chucking on ahead of a long travel day.
The collection comes in black and white as well as "celadon", the hotel’s signature colour. We know which one we’d opt for…
Jumeirah Heritage Club x Bouguessa
Properties in recent years have put an increased emphasis on sense of place, with bathroom toiletries in scents inspired by the destination and local brands in the hotel boutique.
Dubai-born brand Jumeirah has taken that one step further with its Jumeirah Heritage Club collection, working with local contemporary fashion house Bouguessa.
The capsule includes jumpers and T-shirts, including a crew neck featuring the iconic Jumeirah Burj Al Arab.
The St. Regis x STAUD
The Marriott Group is no stranger to clothing collaborations, with The Ritz-Carlton partnering with Late Checkout for two (sadly) sold-out collections over the past two years.
Back in December, it was The St. Regis’ turn, with the brand’s Aspen property partnering with STAUD for après-ski inspired wear.
That translated into a limited edition crew neck, bag and fleece, although the latter is already out of stock. As if you needed more proof that these hotel collections are on the rise…
The Beverly Hills Hotel x La La Land
Dorchester Collection’s Beverly Hills Hotel has paired up with La La Land for the month of love.
That means guests can sip on the LA café’s iconic pink and green matcha coffees, but if you want something longer lasting, you can also pick up minimalist branded crew necks or coffee cups, too.

What was Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s trade envoy role?
Unknown

15:00:03 KST

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of misconduct in public office, bringing his former role as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment into focus. He denies any wrongdoing. But what was that role?
What was the trade envoy job that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor held? The Duke of York, as he was then known, became the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment in October 2001. The role was described by UK Trade & Investment as an “extensive programme of targeted engagements both in the UK and overseas to promote the interest of UK industry and the UK as a whole”.
In essence, the role involved high-level lobbying, as well as the handling of sensitive “confidential briefs” regarding investment opportunities. It required close coordination with the UK’s trade and diplomatic missions abroad.
Who appointed him? He started the role during Tony Blair’s government, after retiring from the navy in July 2001. In 2011, No 10, then under the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition, said the appointment was made “with the agreement of the then foreign secretary [Jack Straw] and the trade and industry secretary [Patricia Hewitt]”.
So he was backed by Labour? Not just Labour, no. When Mountbatten-Windsor was facing calls to step down from the role in 2011, endorsements still arrived from Conservative ministers. George Osborne, the then chancellor, said: “We have confidence in him doing the job and we think he’s done a good job in recent years. He’s promoted British exports. What we want is everyone promoting British exports at the minute and Prince Andrew has done that.”
Later, the former trade minister Digby Jones joined in, stating that Mountbatten-Windsor had “put the country first”.
“It’s important we, as business, say, let’s use what he can do to actually create some profit, employ some people, pay some tax,” the peer added.
Was Mountbatten-Windsor a controversial choice when he was first appointed? He was. Even at the start of the new millennium, there were strong views held by supporters and opponents of a man who had a reputation for acting as a “playboy prince”.
In his book Entitled, the author Andrew Lownie outlines how the former trade secretary Peter Mandelson assisted Mountbatten-Windsor in landing the role of the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment – while his brother, the then Prince Charles, tried to scupper it.
“It was also claimed that Prince Charles was trying to block Andrew’s new role as ‘a disaster waiting to happen’ on the grounds that his brother simply couldn’t be trusted not to disgrace himself,” Lownie wrote. “A palace source said that the Prince of Wales was extremely concerned about Andrew’s playboy image: ‘He thinks he won’t be able to resist the temptation of mixing business with pleasure. This is a high-profile appointment which demands tact and discretion.’”
Whom did he meet in the role and why? The post involved meetings with a series of UK and international business people, as well as foreign leaders, where he would essentially facilitate introductions. These could be mundane and, according to those involved, useful, but dealings with allegedly corrupt regimes, including Kazakhstan, caused awkward publicity. This was particularly true when it emerged that the Kazakh president’s son-in-law, Timur Kulibayev, had bought Mountbatten-Windsor’s former house at Sunninghill Park in 2007, allegedly for £3m over the asking price.
The Kazakh ties persisted, however. In 2010 Mountbatten-Windsor met the UK’s BG Group on three occasions in the five weeks between 25 March and 28 April, including a rendezvous in Kazakhstan.
In March 2011, his links to Saif Gadaffi, the son of the then Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, led to calls for him to be stripped of the role.
Did Mountbatten-Windsor get paid for the job? No. There was no salary for the post. However, expenses and travel costs were paid, which one MP suggested in 2011 “has cost the taxpayer about £4m in the last 10 years, not including the costs to protection officers”.
It seems as if the job description could benefit the UK, though? It could, and the UK still has a variety of figures acting as trade envoys. There are a series of parliamentarians who fill region-specific roles. While many of these posts are a lot less high-profile, the former cricketer Ian Botham was appointed a UK trade ambassador to Australia in 2021.

Tariff loss, falling popularity, soaring costs: Trump challenged ahead of key US speech
As President Donald Trump prepares for his key State of the Union address on Tuesday, the once unstoppable US leader finds himself weighed down by the Supreme Court decision to strike down his signature tariff policy amid souring public opinion over his immigration crackdown and failure to address an affordability crisis.

For a year, Donald Trump has governed the United States with little standing in his way.
Now, as the president prepares for his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he's weighed down with Supreme Court reversals on tariffs, souring public opinion on his immigration crackdown and mounting economic concerns.
Read moreTrump calls Supreme Court decision to strike down his tariffs 'deeply disappointing'
Trump is unlikely to back down in his speech, a primetime American political institution where the president is invited by Congress to present his accomplishments and lay out his agenda.
But his boasts will have less sting on Democrats – and world leaders – who have up to this point been bulldozed by his agenda.
On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered a sharp rebuke of his use of tariffs, which he slapped on countries often arbitrarily via a simple order on social media in an effort to gain leverage over diplomatic matters sometimes wholly unrelated to trade.
The same day, the government data showed the US economy expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the October to December period – significantly below the 2.5 percent pace that analysts had forecasted for the quarter.
Polls meanwhile show growing dissatisfaction with the cost of living as well as Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Cost-of-living concerns
Trump's strategy so far on inflation has been to cede no ground.
"I've won affordability," Trump said during a speech in the southeastern state of Georgia on Thursday.
But "you cannot out-message the economy. People know what they are spending", Todd Belt, a political science professor at George Washington University, told AFP.
"People become very resentful when being told something they know is not true," he said – which applies to both the cost of living but also the crackdown on immigrants, which many Americans had falsely believed would focus on deporting violent criminals.
American voters have proven extremely sensitive to economic issues, which in part sunk Trump's predecessor Joe Biden but now threaten Republicans.
As midterms approach in November, the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate will be up for grabs.
Trump has already warned that if Democrats take control they could try to impeach him.
Backing down?
Even the normally bombastic Trump has been cowed in recent days, including when a racist video of Barack Obama – the country's first Black president – was posted onto his Truth Social account.
The White House tried to brush off the issue before claiming that an unnamed aide posted it, as even loyal members of Congress broke ranks to criticize the president.
After federal immigration agents shot and killed two US citizens during their wide-sweeping operations in Minneapolis, the administration announced it was scaling back the deployment in the city, which was the scene of mass protests.
On the international scene, a US-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington's security concerns in the Arctic, but Trump has had to dial back his threats to seize Greenland.
He has imposed an across-the-board 10 percent tariff on imports into the United States after the Supreme Court rebuffed his previous tariffs Friday – but that still means some nations are now trading at reduced rates than they had agreed to under his previous levies.
The administration has vowed to find other ways to implement tariffs as it decried the court's "lawlessness."

But while Trump has been chastened, the House and the Senate still remain in Republican control – for now. And Trump himself will be in the White House until 2029.

Cycling in Denmark, explained
Unknown

14:00:00 KST

In London recently, on a cold day with a forecast of rain, I threw on a thin sweatshirt and stepped outside. As I unchained my bike from the railings, a neighbour said, “Surely you’re not going to exercise in this weather?”
“Exercise? No way. I’m just cycling to the shops.”
He looked astounded, “You cycle to the shops when you are here in London?”
“Sure”, I replied. “Don’t you use a bike? “He replied, “Well, on Sundays, I get into my lycra cycling gear and speed along the river to keep in good shape.”
Therein lies the difference between cycling culture in Denmark and almost every other country, except Holland. Danes view cycling as a means of transport, a human-powered vehicle that can easily take you to work, the kids to school and in the case of politicians, to Parliament. As for commuters, have you seen how many bikes are stacked up outside Copenhagen’s main train station?
Danes live their lives in the saddle
In the UK, cycling is considered a fitness activity rather than a means of transportation. Getting a sweat on, building up those miles, burning off loads of calories. If a snapshot was taken of bikers waiting at the traffic lights in London and compared to one of bikers in Copenhagen, it would say it all.
The Londoners would be mainly male and wearing Tour de France outfits, while the Copenhageners would be of both sexes, all ages, and wearing everyday clothes, sitting astride a wide assortment of bikes: children-transporting bikes, (aka Christiania bikes ), racing bikes, basket bikes, tandems, and those infernal el-bikes.
I must confess that I avoid cycling in the Copenhagen rush hour. There are so many fast el-bikes and bulky food deliveries, that it can be quite scary to manoeuvre in the hectic surge of 2-wheel traffic. A bridge near me has an estimated 40,000 bikers crossing it per day.
Danes use bikes for everything
One Danish undertaker offers to transport coffins by custom-made bike on the final journey to a church or burial site, while the funeral party walks or cycles alongside. The “Bike Cook” offers a cycling tour of the city and prepares Danish dishes for his customers.
The British may call it “Meals on Wheels “, but their wheels are on a car. I have been involved in the brilliant project conceived by Ole Kassow (check him out on a TED Talk “Cycling Without Age “) in which volunteers take elderly people out of their nursing homes for rides in the fresh air.
I took out a 92-year-old, Carl, on a tricycle bike the day following the destruction of the Stock Exchange building in the heart of Copenhagen. His eyes filled with tears as he realised the famous spire made of dragon’s tails was gone forever, but minutes later, we were laughing in the sunshine, cycling along the canals of Christianshavn.
To Bike or Not to Bike …?
That is the question. You won’t catch me on a bike in the endless winter months, but apparently 80% of Danes still bike, rain or shine, frost or snow. This does not surprise me, when you think that nothing stopped the Vikings from getting into open boats and crossing the Atlantic in all weathers.
The modern Viking has the same bravado. In fact the nicest Dane transforms from being a mild-mannered “hyggelig” type to becoming a crazed helmeted Viking, giving no mercy as he speeds along, yelling at slow bikers like me wobbling nervously on my pedals.
At least in London, I can feel smug about my biking dexterity. I like to imagine that my neighbour watched in admiration as I pedalled off down the street into the sunset. Luckily, I was out of sight when the first drops of rain started to splatter heavily onto my thin sweatshirt.

'In Minneapolis, ICE encountered a political history strong enough to generate a real balance of power'

On February 12, Tom Homan, the so-called "border czar" and special adviser appointed by Donald Trump in 2024 to lead his anti-immigration policy, announced the end of a major police operation known as "Metro Surge" aiming at arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants in Minnesota. The operation mobilized more than 3,000 agents from the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the US Customs and Border Protection. While it resulted in nearly 4,000 arrests, including 2,000 expulsions, it also led to the deaths of two American citizens.
Designed as a show of federal government strength against local asylum policies, the operation was intended to make Minnesota a laboratory for political intimidation. Instead, it turned into a setback for the Trump administration, which failed to impose its balance of power and faced resistance that it had not anticipated. In response to opposition that resonated nationwide, Trump was forced to announce on February 4 that going forward a "softer touch" regarding immigration might be necessary.
Many viewed this failure as a spontaneous democratic awakening; others saw it as a sign of the Democratic Party's renewal. These interpretations capture part of the reality but nevertheless lack depth. The resilience of anti-ICE networks does not stem from fleeting outrage nor simple partisan alignment; rather, it proceeds from a long-term political configuration rooted in specific migration trajectories, firmly established mutual aid infrastructures and longstanding cooperation among community organizations, labor unions and local elected officials. What unfolded in January was not an improvised reaction, but the activation of a time-tested repertoire.
Community protections
Seized from the Dakota and Ojibwe nations, Minnesota was largely settled by exiles from Northern Europe who were drawn to its mining and agricultural resources. By the late 19th century, these rural communities, which were linked to the national market by rail, became the foundation for movements that challenged the financial capitalism dominated by East Coast industrial cities. They gave rise to the Populist Party (1892) and later to the Nonpartisan League (1915), which opposed US entry into World War I and resisted the concentration of economic power.

Sappers deactivate Russian drone that fell on ice of Kyiv Reservoir
According to Ukrinform, the State Emergency Service reported this.
The operation to remove and destroy the explosive device was carried out under challenging conditions: The drone fell a long distance from the shore, and the unstable ice cover posed an additional threat to personnel, making it impossible to move safely on foot.
The task was assigned to a rescue team. Pyrotechnicians were transported to the site where the enemy UAV was detected in a special Bohun snow-and-swamp vehicle.
Specialists carried out the controlled destruction of the drone in compliance with all safety protocols.
As reported by Ukrinform, in January, divers and sappers found about 1.5 kg of explosives in a lake in the Kyiv region.

Lyon mayoral election: Who's running?

Will Lyon's left-wing and Green coalition manage to keep control of its City Hall? Incumbent Green mayor Grégory Doucet's re-election campaign has run into serious difficulty against Jean-Michel Aulas, an independent candidate allied with the right-wing and centrist blocs. Aulas, a businessman and the former president of the local Olympique Lyonnais (OL) football club, has been leading by a significant margin in the polls.
The duel, a polarized race between candidates with two opposing visions of society, has tended to overshadow the other four candidates, who have, at this stage, polled anywhere between 4% and 10% of first-round voting intentions.
Doucet has received endorsements from the parties that comprise his incumbent majority, but he has struggled to assert himself in the face of Aulas's fame. More broadly, the left seems fragmented ahead of the first round, with MP Anaïs Belouassa-Chérifi as the candidate for the radical La France Insoumise (LFI) party, former deputy mayor for cultural affairs Nathalie Perrin-Gilbert running as an independent with backing from the center-left Parti Radical de Gauche (PRG), and Georges Képénékian, a former mayor of Lyon (from 2017 to 2018), also running as an independent. Meanwhile, Alexandre Dupalais is running for a party allied to the far-right Rassemblement National (RN), which could lead to RN members once again sitting on Lyon's city council.
Who are the candidates, and what challenges do they face? Le Monde presents the six main candidates in Lyon's 2026 municipal election.

The US Supreme Court's take-down of Trump's tariffs explained

The US Supreme Court's take-down of Trump's tariffs explained
The US's highest court has struck down a key plank of Donald Trump's economic policy.
It found that tariffs he placed on foreign imports were illegal.
It's a hugely consequential decision that has infuriated the president.
He is now promising to find ways around it.
How did this happen?
Under the US Constitution, Congress has the power to impose tariffs, rather than the president.
But Mr Trump thought he had found a way to give himself the authority to impose tariffs without Congress.
Last year, he declared two national emergencies.
One was a "public health crisis" caused by illegal drugs such as fentanyl.
The other related to "large and persistent" trade deficits.
The White House argued the emergency declarations meant Mr Trump could bring in "emergency tariffs" under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).
First, he placed so-called "fentanyl tariffs" on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. He said this was to pressure those countries to do more to stop drug smuggling.
He later announced "reciprocal tariffs" on imports from almost every other country. He said these were to address trade deficits.
But a group of businesses and a dozen US states sued.
They argued Mr Trump could not give himself the power to impose tariffs by declaring emergencies.
What happened in court?
Before the Supreme Court ruled on the matter, a decision was made in the US Court of International Trade.
It agreed with the suing businesses and states and found Mr Trump's emergency tariffs were illegal.
An appeals court paused that ruling a day later, and the tariffs were reinstated.
But the Supreme Court has now endorsed the trade court's original decision. "IEEPA does not authorise the president to impose tariffs," the Supreme Court found.
Not everyone in the court agreed. Three of the nine justices dissented.
"The tariffs at issue here may or may not be wise policy," Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote.
"But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful."
Have all of Trump's tariffs been struck down?
The decision relates only to the tariffs Mr Trump implemented under emergency orders.
Basically, that means the country-specific tariffs — such as the 10 per cent tariff on Australian imports — have been struck down.
But tariffs on certain types of products — including aluminium, steel, copper, wood, vehicles, auto parts and furniture — are unaffected. Mr Trump used different legislation to bring in those tariffs.
"Roughly speaking, what you should expect going forward is there will be tariffs on things rather than tariffs on countries," said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan and visiting professor at the University of NSW.
How has Trump responded?
Angrily. The decision was "ridiculous" and the justices who made it were "very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution", he said.
After the ruling, he signed an order for a new 10 per cent tariff on many foreign imports.
He did so under a section of trade law that allows him to impose tariffs of up to 15 per cent for 150 days.
He has pledged to find workarounds to bring more tariffs back permanently.
"Other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected," he told a press conference. "We have alternatives. Great alternatives."
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said those alternatives would include running fast-tracked investigations under Section 301 of the Trade Act.
It allows the president to impose tariffs on countries if investigations find those countries are treating the US unfairly.
Mr Greer said:
"We expect these investigations to cover most major trading partners and to address areas of concern such as industrial excess capacity, forced labour, pharmaceutical pricing practices, discrimination against US technology companies and digital goods and services, digital services taxes, ocean pollution, and practices related to the trade in seafood, rice, and other products.
"… If these investigations conclude that there are unfair trading practices and that responsive action is warranted, tariffs are one tool that may be imposed."
Why doesn't Trump ask Congress to authorise tariffs?
Republicans have control of Congress — but only just.
Their slim majority in the House of Representatives means every Republican must vote for a bill in order to pass it, assuming all members are present and no Democrats vote for it.
That's unlikely to happen. In February, six House Republicans broke ranks to vote against tariffs on Canadian goods.
It was a symbolic vote, but it shows tariffs do not have universal support in the party.
What does this mean for Australia?
The 10 per cent "baseline" tariff on Australian imports is gone.
It has been replaced by another 10 per cent tariff, imposed under Section 122 of the Trade Act.
But that law means it can only stay in place for 150 days.
Professor Wolfers said Mr Trump had lost a tool he was using to pressure other countries to bend to his will.
He gives this example:
"The president could try to call the Australian prime minister and say, 'Do what I want or else I'll impose tariffs on Australia'. And Albo would say, 'You can do it for 150 days. I can outwait that, mate. You don't have much leverage.'"
Will tariff money need to be refunded?
This is unclear. But importers that have paid the tariffs are expected to take legal action to claw them back.
The court ruling did not give clear guidance on refunds.
But Justice Kavanaugh, in his dissenting opinion, addressed it:
"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others.
"As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a 'mess.'"
Could Australian companies receive refunds?
Tariffs are paid by the companies that import a product, rather than those that export it.
So, companies operating in the US would be the ones eligible for a refund.
But some Australian exporters establish American subsidiaries to facilitate trade into the US.
"So, it's that subsidiary business that will be entitled to the refund," said Luke Branson, regional global trade leader for Oceania at Ernst & Young.
He said some Australian exporters had also made agreements with US importers to split tariff costs.
"Now, if an Australian exporter has shared some of that tariff cost through a commercial arrangement, they should obviously be seeking to recoup some of that."
EY Australia found Australian companies could be owed $1.4 billion in refunds.
How could refunds be given?
There are processes already in place for refunding tariffs charged in error.
They include "post summary corrections" and "protest" processes through US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
"Businesses should assess which of these two buckets they best fall into and prepare their submissions accordingly in advance of further information from the US courts around how to deal with these refunds," Mr Branson said.

‘Slow this thing down’: Sanders warns US has no clue about speed and scale of coming AI revolution

Bernie Sanders has warned that Congress and the American public have “not a clue” about the scale and speed of the coming AI revolution, pressing for urgent policy action to “slow this thing down” as tech companies race to build ever-more powerful systems.
Speaking at Stanford University on Friday alongside congressman Ro Khanna after a series of meetings with industry leaders in California, Sanders was blunt about what he called the “most dangerous moment in the modern history of this country”.
“The Congress and the American people are very unprepared for the tsunami that is coming,” he said.
Khanna, a progressive Democrat who represents Silicon Valley, shared Sanders’s concerns, warning that the country was experiencing a “new gilded age” run by tech billionaires who believe “they would have been heroic conquerors in a different era”.
“That’s just not my observation,” Khanna said. “That’s what they tell me.”
Khanna and Sanders declined to specify which tech executives they met with during the senator’s visit to California, but the congressman said it was “senior leaders” at the “most prominent tech companies”.
“I think it was important for both Senator Sanders to hear from tech leaders and tech leaders to hear from Senator Sanders, who represents and understands the concerns of so many working-class Americans,” Khanna said in an interview after the event.
During his remarks, Sanders reissued his call for a moratorium on the expansion of AI data centers to “slow down the revolution and protect workers” while policymakers catch up.
Khanna does not want a moratorium, but has instead pushed to “steer” AI, advocating for the US to adopt a “Singapore model” for data center growth, with an emphasis on renewable energy and water efficiency. In his remarks before an auditorium of mostly students, Khanna outlined seven principles to guard against “oligarchic capture and dominance” of wealth generated by AI innovation.
“We must ask not what America can do for Silicon Valley, but what Silicon Valley must do for America,” said the congressman, who is eyed as considering a 2028 presidential bid.
The event capped a days-long visit to California, a state he won in the 2020 presidential primary and where he returned to rally thousands during his Fight Oligarchy tour last year. In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Sanders delivered a scathing denunciation of the “greed” of the billionaire class. There he helped formally launch a campaign for a ballot initiative that would impose a one-time 5% tax on residents worth more than $1bn – a proposal that has already prompted some ultra-wealthy tech leaders to flee, or threaten to do so.
At Stanford, Sanders focused his remarks on his concerns over how AI would impact not only the labor force but personal wellbeing and people’s ability to interact with one another. He mentioned that a restaurant in DC offered a Valentine’s Day special for people and their “AI buddies”, which drew laughs from the students.
It may seem funny, Sanders said, “but the truth is that a lot of people are becoming dependent upon AI for their emotional support. What is the long-term impact of that? What is the long-term impact if we lose work as an important part of our lives? What do we do with our lives?”
Sanders read statements from industry leaders who have predicted widespread automation, and cited projections that AI and robotics could eliminate tens of millions of jobs in the coming decade – from truck drivers to fast‑food workers and many white‑collar roles.
Polling has found Americans are deeply concerned, as federal regulators and states debate how to impose guardrails on the nascent but fast-developing technology. A 2025 Pew survey found that 64% of the public thinks AI “will lead to fewer jobs over the next 20 years”. Just 17% of Americans say “AI will have a very or somewhat positive impact on the United States” over the same period.
The tech CEOs leading the AI race have argued that AI will drive productivity, innovation and new kinds of employment as technological advancements have always done. But critics, like Sanders, say the “unprecedented” speed and scale of the changes threaten to enrich the “multibillionaires” while deepening inequality and leaving policymakers and the public ill-equipped to mount a response in time.
Sander urged his colleagues in Washington – and the public – to begin a serious public debate about the future of work as AI disrupts the economy, democracy and people’s emotional lives.
“AI and robotics are neither good nor bad,” he said. “The question is: will a handful of billionaires benefit from it, or will the general public benefit?”

Putin signs law enabling FSB to order individual internet and mobile disconnections, cites security concerns

Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on Feb. 20 — framed by authorities as a measure to counter security threats and potential attacks — granting Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) broad authority to order the disconnection of individuals from mobile and home internet services.
The legislation obliges telecommunications operators to cut access upon request from the security service, while shielding providers from legal responsibility for such shutdowns, according to Russian independent media outlet Astra.
The measure amends Russia’s law on communications and effectively allows authorities to block a person’s access to internet and mobile networks anywhere under Moscow’s control, including occupied parts of Ukraine.
Russia’s State Duma approved the bill in its final readings on Feb. 17 after rapidly advancing it through parliament following an initial review in January.
The law significantly expands state control over digital communications, granting security agencies sweeping powers to restrict connectivity without court oversight.
Critics say the move further strengthens the Kremlin’s ability to suppress dissent and control information flows amid ongoing wartime censorship and domestic crackdowns.
Russian authorities recently attempted to fully block the Meta-owned WhatsApp messaging app, the social media platform announced on Feb. 12.
In September 2025, Russia's Digital Development Ministry and major internet providers approved a so-called "white list" of websites that would remain accessible during mobile internet blackouts.
The list includes state portals, marketplaces like Ozon and Wildberries, Yandex services, and Kremlin-backed platforms such as VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, and the Max messenger.
However, even these services often fail to function properly during full outages, according to Siberia.Realities.

Brazil’s Lula says Maduro should face trial in Venezuela, not US
Brazil’s President Lula says fate of Venezuelan president should be determined by the ‘people of Venezuela’ and ‘not by foreign interference’.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro should face trial, but that it should take place in a Venezuelan court, rather than in the United States, where he is currently being held after his abduction by the US military.
“I believe that if Maduro has to be trialled, he has to be trialled in his country, not trialled abroad,” Lula said in an interview, emphasising that “what matters now is to re-establish democracy in Venezuela”.
“It has to be solved by the people of Venezuela, and not by foreign interference,” said Lula, citing a history of US-backed dictatorships in Latin America, including Chile, Argentina and Uruguay.
“We cannot accept that a head of state of one country could invade another country and capture the president,” the Brazilian leader added.
Lula’s comments come as Venezuela’s acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, has been working to release hundreds of politicians, activists and lawyers jailed during Maduro’s residency, which began in 2013.
The Brazilian has openly criticised the abduction of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a military operation ordered by US President Donald Trump on January 3.
Maduro was flown to New York after his abduction in a bloody night raid on Caracas. He has since been accused by US authorities of planning to transport drugs to the US alongside other charges.
The US government’s own data shows that Venezuela is not among the world’s major drug producers; however, Trump administration officials have accused Maduro and others of working with the region’s largest drug trafficking groups, including in Colombia and Mexico.
While the Trump administration has claimed that its military buildup near Venezuela and maritime blockade of the country were focused on combating drug trafficking, Trump has laid claim to Venezuelan oil reserves since removing Maduro.
Trump has also invited US oil companies to exploit Venezuela’s oil and said he wants proceeds from the sale of Venezuelan oil “to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States”.

Tucker Carlson accuses Huckabee of 'prioritizing Israel' in combative Ben-Gurion Airport interview
Unknown

04:14:09 UTC
13:14:09 KST

In a two-and-a-half-hour episode released Friday – including a 25-minute monologue before the interview began – conservative commentator Tucker Carlson repeatedly accused US Ambassador Mike Huckabee of prioritizing Israel over the United States, on civilian casualties in Gaza, on convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, on fugitive sex offenders, and on the push for war with Iran.
At one point, Huckabee pushed back, gesturing to his American flag pin: “What flag am I wearing here?”
“Well, that’s, of course, my flag as well,” Carlson replied. But he did not let up.
The sit-down was filmed inside Ben-Gurion Airport’s diplomatic terminal on February 18, after a public back-and-forth between the two former Fox News hosts previously reported by The Jerusalem Post. Carlson did not travel beyond the airport complex.
Huckabee defended his record, pushed back on several of Carlson’s characterizations, and offered what he called a faith-based case for the US-Israel relationship. Not all claims made during the exchange stood up to scrutiny.
Former Fox News anchor Melissa Francis, who told the Post she helped facilitate the sit-down, said Carlson had tried to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu through intermediaries but was rebuffed.
Author and political theorist Yoram Hazony told Carlson it “would not be in his political interest to meet with you,” according to Carlson’s account. Francis said Netanyahu “was not interested.”
Carlson's monologue before the interview
Carlson preceded the sit-down with a 25-minute monologue in which he laid out his case against Israel, the embassy, and Huckabee personally.
After critics noted Carlson had flown in by private jet, he addressed it in his monologue, saying he had chartered the aircraft “which I never do because I’m cheap.”
Carlson filmed the promotional video for his 2024 interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin from the rooftop of the Ritz-Carlton in Moscow. He owns three homes, including two waterfront properties on Gasparilla Island, purchased for a combined $8.4 million. His stepmother is an heiress to the Swanson frozen-food fortune.
In the monologue, Carlson called Israel “probably the most violent country in the world” based on the number of citizens who have “held a gun or shot someone” – conflating mandatory military service with criminal violence in a country whose homicide rate is a fraction of Honduras, Venezuela, or South Africa, and which the 2025 Global Peace Index ranks above Russia, Ukraine, Sudan, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Syria.
He put the number of undocumented immigrants in the United States at “60 million” – three to six times higher than any credible estimate – and called Israel “a police state” where “they put software on your phone,” overstating the documented use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, which has targeted specific individuals rather than visitors broadly.
Pollard, embassy meeting
The interview opened with Carlson confronting Huckabee over his meetings with Jonathan Pollard, the former US Navy intelligence analyst convicted of spying for Israel in the 1980s.
“Everyone I’ve talked to in preparation for this has said the same thing: Jonathan Pollard,” Carlson said.
He called Pollard “the greatest traitor in modern American history” and said he had sold “our battle plans against the Soviet Union” to Israel, which, according to Reagan-era CIA director William Casey, then passed the intelligence to the Soviets.
Pollard’s case is among the most damaging espionage cases in US history, though intelligence professionals have debated whether Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen – both of whom spied for the Soviet Union and whose espionage led to the deaths of US agents – caused greater damage.
Former CIA director James Woolsey noted that Pollard “did not get anybody killed and was not spying for an enemy.”
The declassified CIA Damage Assessment found that Israel’s intelligence requests to Pollard focused on regional intelligence – information on Arab states, Pakistan, and Soviet weapons systems – rather than US war plans against Moscow.
The claim that Israel passed Pollard’s intelligence to the Soviets, first reported by Seymour Hersh, has never been proven. Israel denies it.
Carlson then raised Pollard’s 2021 interview with Israel Hayom, in which Pollard said “all Jews should have dual loyalty” and told young Jewish Americans with security clearances that “not doing anything is unacceptable” and that loyalty to Israel should be “more important than your life.”
Those remarks were widely reported and condemned.
“Do you see why the US ambassador hosting a convicted betrayer of his own country who’s encouraging Americans to continue to betray their country would seem shocking?” Carlson asked.
Huckabee said Pollard had visited the embassy at his own request after Huckabee sent condolences when Pollard’s wife died. “I think we met for maybe 30 minutes. We had a nice, pleasant visit,” Huckabee said.
He pointed out that the meeting was hardly clandestine. “Tucker, if you’ve ever been to the US embassy, you would know there’s no such thing as a secret meeting at the US embassy. There are cameras everywhere.”
He added, “I did. And frankly, I don’t regret it.”
Huckabee also said Pollard had been “sentenced to 30 years.” Pollard was, in fact, sentenced to life in prison. He served approximately 30 years before being paroled in November 2015.
Carlson to Huckabee: 'That is calling for genocide'
The interview’s most intense exchange concerned what Netanyahu said on the eve of war.
On October 28, 2023, as the ground invasion of Gaza began, the prime minister addressed IDF soldiers in a televised speech. “You must remember what Amalek has done to you,” he said, quoting Deuteronomy 25:17.
Carlson walked Huckabee through 1 Samuel 15, in which God commands the Israelites to “kill the men, kill the women, kill the children, kill the infants, kill the donkeys, kill the camels, kill everything.”
“That is genocide,” Carlson said. “God is calling for the genocide of the Amalekites. And the prime minister of Israel described the Palestinians in Gaza as Amalek. That’s calling for genocide. And you know that.”
“I totally disagree,” Huckabee said, adding that he did not know whether it was “an illustrative metaphor.”
Huckabee then made a point that went to the heart of the accusation: “Because if Israel wanted to commit genocide, they could have done it in two-and-a-half hours.” Israel possesses one of the most powerful military forces in the Middle East. His argument rested on the premise that if the intent had been total destruction, Israel had the capacity to do so long ago.
Carlson pressed further: “When you say that at the outset of a war, and then you wind up with massive civilian casualties… then I have to ask you, what is that? And is that kind of thinking consistent with Western values and with Christianity? Do we as Christians believe it’s okay to kill people’s children?”
“No, we don’t,” Huckabee said. “And neither do the Israelis, because they didn’t go after their children.”
The Prime Minister’s Office has stressed that the verse Netanyahu quoted – a commandment to remember, from Deuteronomy – is not the more violent passage Carlson cited. The phrase appears on Holocaust memorials and at Yad Vashem, and Israel’s legal team at the International Court of Justice described it as a standard Jewish commemorative expression about antisemitic violence, calling South Africa’s use of it in its genocide case a “grave distortion.”
The Amalek reference has been used throughout Jewish history as a typology for existential threats, most commonly applied to the Nazis. The rabbinical consensus is that Amalek no longer exists as a people and cannot be identified with any modern group.
What flag am I wearing here?
The sharpest confrontation came when the conversation turned to civilian casualties and the IDF. Carlson asked how many civilians had been killed in Gaza. Huckabee said the only available numbers come from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which he called “dubious.”
“How many kids were killed?” Carlson asked.
“I don’t know. I’m sure it was thousands. And it’s thousands too many,” Huckabee said.
The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry has reported over 17,000 children killed since October 7, 2023. Those figures have not been independently verified, and Israel has repeatedly questioned the ministry’s methodology and its failure to distinguish between combatants and civilians.
Huckabee defended the IDF, saying the military sends text messages, drops leaflets, and makes phone calls before strikes. “Nobody does that. The US doesn’t do that,” he said.
Carlson seized on the comparison. “Your dig at the United States is very revealing,” he said. “Because your priorities are very clear. As an American, permit me a moment of outrage. I said many civilians have been killed, and you said right in the middle of your elaborate defense of the IDF’s killing of civilians, including children, you said they do a better job than the United States does. That’s my country and my government.”
Huckabee responded by pointing to his flag pin: “What flag am I wearing here?”
“Well, that’s, of course, my flag as well,” Carlson said.
When Carlson pushed Huckabee to cite numbers supporting his claim that the IDF had achieved a lower civilian casualty ratio than any army in modern urban warfare, Huckabee could not.
“You don’t know the numbers, do you?” Carlson said.
“From the conversations that I’ve had with the people who fought there,” Huckabee said. “I don’t have the exact numbers for you.”
The IDF’s warning system – phone calls, text messages, leaflets, roof-knocking, and daily evacuation maps – is well documented and widely regarded as unprecedented in scale. The US military has used similar tactics, including leaflet drops and broadcast warnings, but less frequently and not at the systematic level that has become standard IDF practice.
'Terror kids' and live ammunition
In Huckabee’s description of child casualties, he said, “Some of the kids who were killed had been recruited to be in the military. Kids as young as 14 years old. They were terror kids.”
“Do you hear yourself?” Carlson replied.
Carlson later returned to the exchange: “You told me that 14-year-olds deserve to die, because they’re working for Hamas.”
“You’re putting words in my mouth,” Huckabee said. “I never said deserve to die.”
“So do you think a 14-year-old child has agency?” Carlson asked. “Do you think that he deserves to die, because he’s being used by adults? Isn’t his death a crushing tragedy?”
Hamas has run military training camps for children and has been implicated in attacks carried out by minors, according to UN reports and international monitoring organizations. The recruitment of children under 15 into armed groups constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute, and international law treats recruited children as victims – not combatants.
Carlson also pressed Huckabee on the use of live ammunition near aid distribution sites. “Are you okay with using live ammunition at aid distribution sites for families, women, and children?” he asked.
Huckabee said: “Very rarely did this happen near aid distribution sites.”
“How about at all?” Carlson replied. “Are you okay with that?”
“No,” Huckabee answered.
What has actually happened near Gaza’s aid distribution points remains sharply disputed. The IDF has said troops fired warning shots at suspects who deviated from designated routes, away from the sites themselves.
The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which operates the sites, has denied that gunfire occurred at its distribution centers. Hamas has accused the IDF of firing on civilians seeking food – a claim Israel denies.
Fugitive sex offenders? 'Send him back'
Carlson then shifted to leverage. “We’re obviously the single largest source of outside funding for this country,” he said – a statement that is true of military aid, though almost all of it flows back to US defense contractors rather than funding Israel’s domestic budget.
He pressed Huckabee on what he described as “dozens and dozens” of accused sex offenders from the United States who had fled to Israel, citing the recent case of Tom Artiom Alexandrovich, a senior Israel National Cyber Directorate official arrested in a Las Vegas sting in August 2025 on charges of soliciting a minor online, who posted bail and returned to Israel without surrendering his passport.
The broader issue is well documented. A CBS News investigation and Jewish Community Watch, an American Jewish organization founded by Orthodox abuse survivors, tracked over 60 such cases between 2014 and 2020, prompting Israel to require FBI background checks for immigrating Americans.
“I think it would fall to you to advocate with your friend, the prime minister,” Carlson said. “How can you take an accused child molester and shield him from American justice? Send him back to the United States.”
“There has never been a request for me to engage in that,” Huckabee said. “I would be happy to do it if the White House sent a message to me.”
On the principle, Huckabee was careful. “It’s an allegation. Let’s be clear. One thing about our system of jurisprudence is that you’re innocent until proven guilty. But if charges exist, should he be extradited? I would say so,” he said.
Epstein, Herzog, and Barak
Carlson did not ease up when the conversation moved to Jeffrey Epstein. He told Huckabee that President Isaac Herzog “apparently was at Pedo Island.”
The accusation hangs on a single name – “Herzog” – that appears in a 2014 email buried among more than 3 million pages of Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice on January 30, 2026. No major investigative outlet has confirmed that this refers to the Israeli president, let alone verified a visit. The release is so vast that much of it remains unreviewed.
Huckabee did not engage. “I haven’t kept up with that,” he said. “I’ve never met the man. I don’t know him.”
Former prime minister Ehud Barak’s connections to Epstein are more extensively documented, including multiple island visits confirmed by scheduling records and photographs reviewed by the Post.
Christians, Law of Return, and spitting
One of the interview’s quieter but more substantive threads concerned the status of Christians in Israel – a subject Carlson has made central to his recent coverage.
In his February “Christian Persecution” episode, as the Post previously reported, Carlson claimed that Christians in Israel are “far fewer in absolute numbers” than when the state was founded.
Data from Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics shows the opposite: The Christian population has grown from approximately 34,000 in 1949 to around 185,000 today.
On the Law of Return, Carlson was on firmer ground. Ethnic Jews who convert to Christianity are ineligible for automatic citizenship under established Israeli case law.
Huckabee said he personally knows Messianic Jews who have made aliyah – some have, through spousal or grandchild provisions – but the legal position is clear.
Carlson also raised Israel’s 1977 Penal Law restricting inducements for religious conversion, and incidents of ultra-Orthodox Jews spitting on Christian clergy in Jerusalem’s Old City – incidents the Post has reported on extensively, including arrests, an emergency academic conference, and a pledge from Netanyahu of “zero tolerance.”
Huckabee did not hedge. “It shouldn’t happen. It’s horrible,” he said, comparing it to antisemitic attacks in New York.
But he drew on five decades of personal experience: “I’ve been coming in and out of Jerusalem and Israel for 50, well, soon to be 53 years. Before I came as an ambassador, I made over 100 trips here. I’ve never been spat on.”
Shadi Khalloul told the Post separately that the spitting incidents are perpetrated by a “fanatic, tiny minority” and are “punished when reported.” He said Carlson was “totally wrong” about the broader Christian experience in Israel.
And it was on this subject – Arab and minority citizens – that Huckabee landed what may have been his strongest moment in the interview.
“Do you realize there are lots of Arab Israelis? They vote. They serve in the Knesset. They serve on the Supreme Court,” he said. “And did you know that it was an Arab who sentenced a former president and prime minister to prison?”
Judge George Karra, an Arab Christian Israeli, convicted president Moshe Katsav of rape in 2010 and was later appointed to the Supreme Court.
Justice Salim Joubran sat on the panel that upheld both Katsav’s conviction and former prime minister Ehud Olmert’s corruption conviction. It was a rare moment in the interview where Huckabee offered a fact that needed no qualification.
US aid, Iran, and free abortion
The final stretch of the interview turned to money, and the question of what America gets for it.
The Council on Foreign Relations reports that since October 7, 2023, the United States has provided at least $16.3 billion in direct military aid to Israel. The Quincy Institute estimates the total at $21.7 billion, including additional arms transfers.
Huckabee claimed the return on investment is “400 to 1,200 percent” – a figure common in pro-Israel advocacy but not easily traced to an independent analysis.
Carlson tried an angle clearly aimed at Huckabee’s Evangelical base: Israel provides universal healthcare and state-funded abortion. “Why would we send any money to a country that provides free abortion?” he asked.
“Because the money that we send does not pay for healthcare. It does not pay for abortion. It pays for military things,” Huckabee said.
When approaching the Iran situation, the two men talked past each other. Carlson accused Netanyahu of pushing America toward regime change in Iran for decades.
Netanyahu has long publicly opposed Iran’s nuclear program, and during the June 2025 war suggested regime change “could certainly be the result” of Israel’s strikes – though his government simultaneously said it was not a goal of the operation.
Huckabee argued that Iran is America’s enemy regardless of what Israel wants, citing the IRGC’s designation as a foreign terrorist organization, Iranian plots to assassinate President Donald Trump, and Tehran’s funding of Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis – all confirmed by the US State Department.
Neither man conceded the other’s framing.
The airport incident
What happened after the cameras stopped became the trip’s most publicly contested element.
Carlson told The Daily Mail that producers were taken into separate rooms, questioned about the interview’s content, and he was told twice to “leave your guy behind.”
Both the Israel Airports Authority and Huckabee disputed the account, saying the group was asked routine security questions in accordance with standard procedures.
A video circulating on social media the following day appeared to further undercut Carlson’s version. The footage showed Carlson signing a document near a security checkpoint, then putting his arm around an airport employee and smiling for a photo before walking away.
Former prime minister Naftali Bennett called Carlson “a chickenshit” who “made up a story.”
Francis, the former Fox News anchor who helped arrange the sit-down, told the Post that Trump had directly urged Carlson to “turn down the temperature” on the Israel debate within the conservative movement.
Within hours of landing back in the United States, Carlson released a new episode titled “Israel’s purging of Christians from the Holy Land and the plot to keep Americans from noticing.”

Bennett addresses leaked recording controversy: 'Ben-Gvir has no place in my government'

Ex-PM Naftali Bennett said in an X/Twitter post on Friday that he would not allow Itamar Ben-Gvir to join his government, clarifying his stance after a recording leaked on Thursday revealed he "does not boycott" the far-right minister.
Bennett wrote: "Amazing grassroots activity now all over the country. I meet with people from Israel everywhere, listen to them, and talk to everyone. I want to be clear: Itamar Ben-Gvir has no place in my government. Not because of 'boycott rhetoric,' but because he is a failed minister who acts with bullying and racism against the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state."
Bennett also took the opportunity to thank activists across the country, adding: "We have the power to fix Israel."
The shift from the phrase "I do not boycott" to "There is no place for him in my government" is not just a semantic change; it represents a shift in his stance.
In the released recordings, Bennett expresses his desire to distance himself from boycott politics, emphasizing the need to "break the bloc mentality," while noting that he doesn't rule out sitting with anyone. However, he also described Ben-Gvir as someone unfit for serious leadership. Now, with a public tweet that carries significant weight, Bennett makes a clear rejection of Ben-Gvir and justifies it on both moral and functional grounds.
No place for a Ben-Gvir partnership in Bennett's government
In Bennett’s circle, this is being presented as a clarification rather than a change of direction. According to them, no partnership was promised before, but there was simply a reservation against the rhetoric of automatic rejections. However, politically, the clarification comes at a sensitive time.
Bennett’s earlier remarks about forming a "broad national unity government" after the elections, inspired by the 1984 rotation model, raised suspicions within the opposition bloc. Questions were raised about whether his call to break the bloc division might eventually lead to an alliance with Likud and Benjamin Netanyahu.
Against this backdrop, attention should also be given to the video Bennett attached to his tweet. When asked if he would sit under a Netanyahu government, Bennett replied: "No. I am going to replace Netanyahu." While until now, he had left room for interpretation regarding the future coalition structure, Bennett is now clearly stating his goal to lead the camp and replace the current prime minister, not integrate under him.
In practice, Bennett is trying to balance two extremes: maintaining a statesmanlike image that calls for broad government and cross-bloc cooperation, while also making it clear that he has red lines with both Ben-Gvir and Netanyahu.
The move is aimed at stabilizing his position in the center of the political map, but it also serves to prevent the leakage of potential voters who fear a scenario in which he aligns with the far-right or enters a government led by Netanyahu.
The open question remains: What will the "broad government" Bennett is talking about actually look like, if it does not include Ben-Gvir and is not led by Netanyahu? Is this an attempt to redraw the boundaries between the right and the center, or simply a tactical move to address concerns within the opposition?
National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir responded to Bennett's remarks in a tweet on his X account: "Bennett the crook. I would not join the government of a friend of Mansour Abbas and of the one who canceled the enforcement chapter in the Negev. You on the left will continue to babble, and we will continue to manage the country."

Pentagon moves troops at Qatar Al Udeid, Middle East bases amid tensions with Iran - NYT

The United States has been moving troops stationed at bases in the Middle East for undisclosed missions amid concerns of a possible war with Iran, with a Friday report by The New York Times indicating that hundreds of troops have been moved from the Al Udeid base in Qatar, according to cited Pentagon officials.
The report also notes that there has been similar movement at the cluster of US bases in Bahrain, which house the Navy’s 5th Fleet, as well as Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates.
According to the Times, American officials may be concerned that the 30,000 to 40,000 US troops currently stationed in the Middle East could be the main target of Islamic Republic in case of an all-out war.
The Pentagon officials consulted by the Times said that the conflict would be different from the attack on Al Udeid back in June 2025, where Iranian officials notified the US in advance about the strike. The Iranian mission to the UN warned that, in case of an American attack, "all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets."
That is why analysts say that the US is moving air defense systems into the Middle East to be able to defend its troops and interests effectively against an Iranian attack.
US' finite supply of interceptors
Katherine Thompson of the Cato Institute told the report that the current assets moved to the Middle East show an intention for a conflict much longer than the last 12-day war, with the Pentagon appearing to be “anticipating an Iranian response that could be a significant risk to American bases in the region.”
“The ability of the United States to sustain a prolonged defense of its forces and basing in the region, while also supporting Israel’s defense, is a major concern,” she said.
That is also the reason behind the US decision to keep its two air carriers in a relatively distant position to the Islamic Republic, in order to protect them from becoming a target.
Commited for diplomatic solution, Iran rejects discussing ballistic missiles
The report concludes that the Trump administration remains committed to finding a diplomatic solution to the situation in Iran.
It also says that several officials see the Iranian offers as insufficient to dissuade US President Donald Trump from attacking the Islamic Republic.
A Reuters report on Friday said that Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi refused to open an envelope from the US side containing missile‑related proposals during the recent talks in Oman.
Reuters also reported that strikes against Iran could include targeting individuals and even pursuing regime change in Tehran, if ordered by Trump, two US officials said.
The latest revelations suggest more granular, ambitious planning ahead of a decision by Trump, who has in recent days publicly floated the idea of regime change in the Islamic Republic.

Dozens of jurors dismissed from Elon Musk Twitter takeover trial after his own lawyer admits so many ‘hate him’
A group of investors is suing Musk for allegedly making misleading statements about bot accounts on Twitter during his drama-filled acquisition

Dozens of jurors have been dismissed from tech billionaire Elon Musk’s civil trial regarding his actions during his takeover of Twitter, now known as X, after his own lawyer admitted so many Americans “hate him.”
A group of investors is suing Musk in a San Francisco federal court for allegedly making misleading statements about bot accounts on Twitter, causing its stock price to plummet. His comments were made during his drama-filled $44 million acquisition of Twitter.
Nine jurors were picked out of a pool of 93 Americans in a selection process that took more than five hours Thursday, Bloomberg Law reports.
Nearly 40 prospective jurors were quickly removed after they said they would not be able to push aside their biases.
Musk’s attorney, Stephen Broome, raised concerns about the ire prospective jurors had toward his client.
Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is the richest person in the world. He thrust himself into the political spotlight during his stint as the head of President Donald Trump’s federal workforce-cutting Department of Government Efficiency.
“We have so many people in the venire who hate him so much that we’re becoming desensitized,” Broome said, per Bloomberg Law. He explained that if a prospective juror said they hated the defendant in any other case, they would definitely be eliminated.
But U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer said this isn’t like any other case, likening Musk to “the president of the United States,” according to reports.
“He is a public figure, and as a public figure, he will excite views, strong views. The question is whether or not they can set them aside,” Breyer said.
Musk reached a deal to buy Twitter in April 2022. The deal eventually went through in October of that year, but not before Musk made his indecision over the acquisition publicly known.
On May 13, 2022, Musk tweeted that the deal was on hold “pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.” Twitter shares fell a staggering 9.6 percent that day.
The class action trial between Musk and Twitter investors is expected to begin on March 2 and last for two weeks.

US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for talks with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, the White House has announced.
The summit between Trump and Xi, the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies, will be watched closely, particularly in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Trump’s sweeping tariffs.
Observers noted that the court’s decision could leave Trump with less leverage against China during negotiations and might give a fresh lift to trade.

The trip will be Trump’s first visit to China since coming to office for a second time – his previous trip to the country was in November 2017 during his first term.
Xi is expected to visit the United States later this year.

Relations between the two countries have been rocky since Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China at the start of his second term. In a series of tit-for-tat actions, the White House imposed triple-digit “retaliatory” levies on Chinese goods and Beijing mounted a sweeping boycott of US agricultural goods for much of last year.

US President Donald Trump told Vietnam’s top leader To Lam he would “instruct the relevant agencies” to remove the country from a list restricted from accessing advanced US technologies, Vietnam’s government announced on Saturday.
The two leaders met in person for the first time at the White House on Friday, after Lam attended the inaugural meeting of Trump’s “Board of Peace” in Washington.
“Donald Trump said he would instruct the relevant agencies to soon remove Vietnam from the strategic export control list,” Hanoi’s Government News website said.

Three Vietnamese airlines announced nearly US$37 billion in purchases this week, in a series of contracts signed with US aerospace companies.

How the Ukrainian army is standing up to Russia: 'Still being here four years after the attack is a victory'

Like soldiers who have seen too much, Ilya – whose nom de guerre is "Ike" – fixed his counterpart with a gaze devoid of all emotion. Stationed between Izium, a strategic city in northeastern Ukraine that Russian forces occupied from April to September 2022, and the nearby front line, he commands a former special border guard unit that had been transferred to the regular army. On this freezing evening in early February, seated before a steaming cup of tea, he agreed to talk without realizing that his impassive demeanor spoke volumes about four years of war, and about the physical and psychological toll it has taken. Unflappable, his voice steady, he nevertheless pointed out that few people had imagined Ukraine would be able to defy the odds by holding back a Russian army vastly superior in numbers and equipped with massive military production capacity.
Every morning, Ilya said he still finds the strength to motivate his men by telling them to "make the world a better place by killing as many Russians as possible." As with other Ukrainian units, drones play a central role, but his men still engage in numerous close-combat fights. "The Russians are advancing," he admitted, "but very slowly, and at the cost of colossal human losses that will eventually wear down Moscow's military apparatus. The difference in the value attached to human life between them and us largely explains our resistance."

The ecological health of China’s Yangtze River is undergoing a meaningful recovery, just halfway through a 10-year fishing ban to restore the ecosystem, a new study has found.
As one of the country’s vital waterways – and among the world’s most biodiverse rivers – the Yangtze has long supported immense economic and social functions. At its peak, it contributed more than 60 per cent of China’s freshwater fisheries output.
Yet from the 1950s, the river basin faced sustained ecological decline due to overfishing, dam construction, water pollution and heavy shipping traffic. Over 70 years, freshwater catches dropped to just a quarter of historical highs, and 135 fish species documented in previous surveys have not been recorded in recent ones.
Advertisement
To reverse the decline, Beijing enacted a 10-year fishing moratorium in 2021 along critical sections of the Yangtze, including its main stem, major tributaries, large connected lakes and designated estuarine areas.
The scale of the undertaking was immense: more than 111,000 fishing vessels were recalled and 231,000 fishers were resettled, backed by an investment of more than US$2.7 billion.
Advertisement
The ban was reinforced by the Yangtze River Protection Law, which also took effect in 2021. It introduced stricter regulations on water quality, sand mining and shoreline restoration.

Ukraine war briefing: Hungary threatens to block €90bn EU loan to Kyiv in oil row

The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has threatened to veto the EU’s €90bn ($106bn) loan to Ukraine unless Kyiv restores Russian oil deliveries through a pipeline on its territory. Ukrainian authorities say the Druzhba pipeline was shut down after being damaged during a Russian attack in January, angering Kremlin allies Orbán and the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico. “As long as Ukraine blocks the Druzhba pipeline, Hungary will block the €90 billion Ukrainian war loan,” Orbán said on Facebook on Friday. “We will not be pushed around!” Slovakian economy minister Denisa Sakova said Ukraine had postponed the resumption of oil deliveries until 24 February. On Wednesday, Fico declared a state of emergency over supplies and threatened retaliatory measures against Ukraine if the pipeline – which runs from Russia through its territory to Slovakia and Hungary – was not reopened.
-
Hungary’s foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, confirmed it was opposing the EU loan, saying on X on Friday: “By blocking oil transit to Hungary through the Druzhba pipeline, Ukraine violates the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, breaching its commitments to the European Union. We will not give in to this blackmail.”
-
Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said his country is not losing its war against Russia, has taken hundreds of square kilometres in a new counteroffensive and that European troops should deploy right on the frontline after any ceasefire. The Ukrainian president told Agence France-Presse ahead of the war’s fourth anniversary on 24 February: “You can’t say that we’re losing the war. Honestly, we’re definitely not losing it, definitely. The question is whether we will win.” Speaking at the presidential palace in Kyiv, he added: “That is the question – but it’s a very costly question.”
-
Zelenskyy said Kyiv’s forces were gaining ground in counterattacks along the southern frontline. “I won’t go into too many details,” Zelenskyy told AFP of the advances, “but today I can congratulate our army first and foremost – all the defence forces – because as of today, 300 [square] kilometres have been liberated.” He did not say over what timeframe and the claim could not be verified. Military bloggers have suggested some of those gains could have been aided by sweeping outages of Elon Musk’s Starlink internet terminals across the Ukraine front. Zelenskyy said Kyiv was taking advantage of the situation but conceded that Ukrainian forces had also experienced interruptions due to the outages. “There are problems, there are challenges,” he said.
-
Five of Europe’s top military powers have announced a joint programme to quickly develop low cost drones, as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the fighting in Ukraine drives a shift in modern warfare. Defence ministers and deputy ministers from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Poland said in a statement on Friday that the low-cost effectors and autonomous platforms (Leap) initiative would help “improve our collective security” within Nato while strengthening European cooperation. German defence minister Boris Pistorius said the aim of the project was to “rapidly and cheaply develop innovative systems, in particular for defence against drones, and then just as rapidly produce them in large numbers”. UK minister of state Luke Pollard said each member of the group has made a “multimillion” dollar commitment to advance the technology needed to start producing components of the new system “within 12 months”.
-
The US and Britain uncovered Vladimir Putin’s plans to invade Ukraine but most of Europe – including Volodymyr Zelenskyy – dismissed them. Shaun Walker’s exclusive account draws on more than 100 interviews with senior intelligence officials and other insiders in multiple countries. As the war anniversary approaches and the world enters a new period of geopolitical uncertainty, Europe’s politicians and spy services continue to draw lessons from the failures of 2022.
-
Ukrainian drones damaged a site in southern Russia’s Udmurtia region, the governor said early on Saturday. Injuries had resulted, Alexander Brechalov also said on Telegram. An unofficial Ukrainian Telegram site, Realna Viyna, said Ukrainian forces had attacked a plant manufacturing Russian missiles in the city of Votkinsk in Udmurtia, about 1,400km (780 miles) from Ukraine and posted what it said were pictures of the strike.

Ukrainian competitors will boycott the Milano Cortina Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 March in Verona, their committee said on Friday, due to the authorisation of some Russian and Belarusian athletes with their national flags.

More than 5,000 women and girls have been killed in Ukraine and another 14,000 injured since Russia’s invasion began in February 2022, Sofia Calltorp, the head of UN Women in Geneva, told reporters on Friday.

Court gives Trump a harsh lesson in the limits of his power
Washington: About a year ago, after Donald Trump addressed Congress in a State of the Union-esque speech, he clasped the hand of US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and said: “Thank you. Thank you again. Won’t forget it.”
There was much speculation at the time that Trump was thinking of Roberts’ majority verdict in 2024 granting him widespread immunity, as president, from criminal prosecution.
Trump denied that’s what he meant – he said he was thanking Roberts for swearing him in at his inauguration – but he did have much to thank Roberts for. The conservative majority on the court has been kind to Trump and his sweeping agenda that pushes the limits of presidential power.
That is, until now. In a 6-3 ruling on Friday (Washington time) the US Supreme Court struck down Trump’s signature “Liberation Day” tariffs, finding he did not have the authority to impose the duties using emergency powers.
The decision torpedoes the president’s economic agenda, and exposes the US federal government to demands for refunds totalling as much as $US160 billion ($226 billion). But more than that, it exposes Trump for exceeding his presidential authority, and represents the biggest curb on his power to date.
The ruling wasn’t personal, obviously, but Trump seemed to take it that way – as he often does. The Democrat-appointed justices on the court were “a disgrace to our nation”, Trump said.
Others were being “politically correct” and serving as “fools and lapdogs for the RINOS [Republicans in name only] and the radical left Democrats … they’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution”.
But Trump reserved his harshest judgment for the justices he appointed in his first term who ruled the tariffs unlawful: Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Their families would be embarrassed, he claimed.
He clearly felt betrayed. “You can’t knock their loyalty,” Trump said of the Democrat-appointed justices. “That’s one thing you can do with some of our people.”
Since returning to power, Trump has stacked out various Washington institutions – the Kennedy Centre, the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, to name just a few – that have now become his fiefdoms. Evidently, he shares the same expectations for “our people” on the nation’s high court.
The president offered up conspiratorial theories for why the court ruled the way it did. It was “swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think”, he said, seemingly referring to the Democrats and the left wing.
The judges might have been cajoled by “fear or respect or friendships, I don’t know”, Trump said. At another point, he said they may have been “catering to a group of people in [Washington] DC” - possibly a reference to the city’s contingent of free trade advocates.
The power of the presidency is not absolute, even though it sometimes feels that way.
An annoyed Trump was also snappy with reporters, and refused to take certain people’s questions. “I don’t talk to CNN, it’s fake news,” he said, pointing at the network’s White House correspondent Kristen Holmes.
Trump seemed genuinely shocked the court ruled as it did – and to be fair, the idea that a president can block imports from a country under emergency laws, but not tariff them, does sound perverse, as Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in his dissenting opinion.
But the verdict is hardly a surprise.
Sceptical questions from the justices at a hearing last year indicated it was likely not going to be the slam dunk win for the government that Trump thinks it should have been. And we know the administration has been preparing for this exact outcome for months.
Indeed, Trump had a solution ready to go – a 10 per cent global tariff enacted using the Trade Act, for 150 days, which will have to be extended by Congress.
That now looms as Trump’s next big political test, and he will need the votes of those “RINOs” he disparaged from the podium on Friday.
The Supreme Court showed in its ruling that despite its conservative majority, its indulgence of Trump in the immunity ruling and the narrative in some quarters about a supplicant bench, it is still a serious guardrail in American democracy.
The system can still work as intended. The power of the presidency is not absolute, even though it sometimes feels that way.
That was the harsh lesson delivered to Trump. And it explains why he was so affronted by the decision, even though he believes he can raise just as much revenue – if not more – by imposing tariffs in other ways.

The Munich moment that changed everything for Marco Rubio - opinion

Indispensability is never declared. It is tested. It arrives when the crisis hits – and everyone in the room turns to the same person. That has been Marco Rubio’s trajectory over the past year. Not louder. Not flashier. Just heavier.
Secretary of State, yes – but also acting national security adviser, crisis manager, alliance stabilizer, and translator between presidential instinct and institutional consequence.
Venezuela fractures. Tehran escalates. Europe recalibrates. Energy markets tighten. China maneuvers. And again and again, Rubio is handed the file. Presidents do naot concentrate that level of responsibility in one person unless they trust both his judgment and his steadiness.
The internet has noticed what Washington already knows. The memes are everywhere: Rubio photoshopped as the new Shah of Iran, the new Venezuelan ruler, the next global strongman, even the halftime performer.
It’s funny precisely because it captures something real. He has become, culturally and operationally, the “Secretary of Everything.” The joke works because the burden is visible. Rubio’s LinkedIn must look like a CVS receipt – unfold it, and it touches the floor. And presidents do not assign that much weight unless they believe someone can carry it.
Munich proved he can.
The Munich Security Conference is not a campaign rally.
It is the annual gathering of NATO leaders, defense ministers, intelligence chiefs, and strategic thinkers who shape the Western alliance. When an American Secretary of State speaks there, the audience is not voters. It is history.
Rubio did not deliver technocratic reassurance.
Rubio delivered doctrine. He warned against the “dangerous delusion” that history had ended and that sovereign nations could dissolve into a frictionless global order. He rejected the West’s drift toward “managed decline.” He argued that alliances must be built on strong nation-states, not on dependency or fear. He insisted that what binds the Atlantic alliance is not bureaucracy but inheritance – civilizational confidence and shared responsibility. It was not a rejection of Europe. It was a demand that Europe stand upright.
When he finished, the hall gave him a standing ovation. That matters.
Standing ovation signals recognition
Munich audiences are measured, skeptical, and often wary of American populism. They do not stand on their feet easily. A standing ovation in that room signals recognition – not excitement. It signaled that Rubio was not improvising. He was articulating. And articulation is the first step toward leadership.
In the biblical tradition, Moses delivers revelation. Aaron ensures it is heard. Moses thunders; Aaron translates. One disrupts; the other steadies.
In this administration, Donald Trump often plays the role of a disruptive force – resetting assumptions and forcing debates others avoid. Rubio has increasingly played the Aaron role: not softening the message, but rendering it legible to allies, institutions, and skeptics who might otherwise recoil. That interpretive role is not subordinate. It is indispensable. Munich showed that Rubio can carry the doctrine without losing the room.
But rhetoric without execution is performance.
What makes Munich significant is that it sits atop a year of operational gravity. In Venezuela, Rubio has been central to shaping and managing the aftermath of Nicolás Maduro’s removal and the fragile transition that followed.
Removing a dictator took a weekend. Governing the aftermath takes a season – sometimes a decade. The policy has drawn legal scrutiny, moral debate, and congressional friction. That is what happens when power is used rather than discussed. The question is not whether controversy exists; it is whether order can be imposed without sliding into chaos. That burden has not been theoretical for Rubio. It has been practical.
The consequences have rippled outward. Cutting off Venezuelan oil affects Cuba, regional energy stability, and migration flows that eventually reach American borders. Energy is not abstract; it is leverage. When grids flicker, politics shifts. When politics destabilize, populations move. And when populations move, the geopolitical map redraws itself, whether or not speeches catch up.
This is also where China enters the frame. China’s energy exposure to Venezuela is strategically relevant. More importantly, Beijing’s broader strategy hinges on controlling supply chains, energy routes, and critical minerals.
The next decade will not be defined by missiles alone. It will be defined by supply chains. It will be defined by who controls lithium, cobalt, rare earths, and the chokepoints of global production.
The United States sending troops to Nigeria for training missions is not random. Nigeria sits on major mineral deposits and is in a region where Chinese investment has been deep and sustained. You do not need to declare a coming war over minerals to recognize the strategic positioning underway.
Rubio’s Munich speech directly addressed this worldview. He warned against allowing adversaries to dominate supply routes and economic leverage points. He framed sovereignty not as nostalgia but as a strategic necessity.
That is not reactive diplomacy.
That is long-term thinking.
Tehran fits within this same architecture. Rubio’s approach to Iran has not been read as a reckless escalation. It has been read as disciplined realism: diplomacy first, calibrated force when necessary, reassessment of intelligence, and renewed deterrence.
The volatility in Tehran is real, and Israeli officials read every American move not as commentary but like its the weather.
What distinguishes Rubio’s posture is not aggression; it is control. Power is not a temper tantrum. It is conflict managed without delusion.
Now place that against the progressive contrast.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also appeared in Munich. She is articulate and energetic, and she commands attention within her base. But the progressive coalition in America does not automatically translate into a coherent global worldview. Munich is not a domestic rally. It is a room full of defense ministers and intelligence chiefs.
When pressed on questions of Taiwan, China, and economic realism – including by voices from countries like Argentina that have lived through fiscal collapse – the difference between rhetorical conviction and governing fluency becomes clear. Global leadership requires more than moral posture. It requires structural understanding.
This is not about humiliation.
It is about scale.
Executive readiness is built on classified briefings, sanctions architecture, alliance maintenance, and trade-off management. Rubio has spent years in those rooms. That experience shows. Succession does not begin with slogans.
It begins with a burden.
The post-Trump Republican future will not be decided by who can echo Trump most faithfully. It will be decided by who can manage the world Trump has reshaped, where sanctions, energy leverage, minerals, deterrence, and domestic backlash collide daily. Munich suggested something new: Rubio is not merely executing policy. He is interpreting the era.
Interpretation is how inheritance begins.
Indispensability is not declared. It is accumulated. The world keeps landing on his desk – and he does not flinch. Munich did not crown Marco Rubio. But it made something unmistakably clear. The secretary of everything no longer just carries the message. He is shaping what comes next, and the room is already listening.

Epstein scandal leaves some young Trump voters feeling betrayed
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK - “Not to be trusted.” A “betrayal”.
This is how some young people on the right have characterised US President Donald Trump and his administration’s response to the Justice Department’s latest release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
For them, the Epstein story is something of a full-circle moment in their political lives – a reason they cast their ballots for Mr Trump in 2024 that has calcified into anger and disillusionment.
“We started out not trusting the government, so we voted for Trump and for something new,” said 23-year-old Kai Schwemmer, a student at Brigham Young University and a member of the Utah Federation of College Republicans.
“And now, we’re watching him turn into the same thing we’ve had for all this time. If a populist, right-wing president is not to be trusted, what does that leave you with?”
Drawn to Mr Trump for his pledge to take down the political elite, Mr Schwemmer is among those Gen Z conservatives who cast their first ballots for Mr Trump to see a disruptive outsider enact a sweeping political reset.
But they say their faith in Mr Trump has diminished in recent weeks as they have observed the administration’s response to the Epstein scandal.
For his part, Mr Schwemmer thinks the President has demonstrated a “lack of seriousness” and a pattern of “obfuscation” as communications related to Epstein have revealed a globe-spanning web of ties to powerful figures
Included in the recently disclosed files are the names of six current administration officials, Mr Trump’s among them.
To be sure, there are other issues preoccupying the minds of young conservatives, including cost of living and immigration. And some are prepared to ride out the storyline and remain loyal to the President.
Mr Matt Wallace, a 27-year-old crypto influencer in South Florida, said Mr Trump had done “more bad stuff lately” than he would prefer to see. “But we owe him a lot for what he’s done,” Mr Wallace said. “I don’t call it support, I call it appreciating the President.”
Still, he added, “he needs to release all of the Epstein files immediately, no question. He can’t be protecting people just because they’re his donors”.
Ms Ella Maulding, a 22-year-old conservative who lives in Mississippi, urged the same. “We won’t be moving on from this,” she said. “We want to see this administration take down the establishment, drain the swamp and prosecute elite rings of predators.”
This is a striking moment of disillusion for some young Republicans in an already cynical segment of the Trump coalition. As alarms over the Republicans’ midterm chances continue to sound
Despite Mr Trump’s campaign promise to immediately release an “Epstein client list”, the President has, over the past year, dismissed the scandal as a “Democratic hoax” and a “never-ending saga”.
In recent days, Mr Trump said he was tiring of the affair entirely. “I think it’s really time for the country to get on to something else,” he said during a news conference in February.
When mixed with young voters’ concerns over affordability, the response has painted a picture of a president more aligned with the so-called “Epstein class” than with his base, said Mr Lucas Holtz, a senior adviser at Third Way, a centre-left think-tank often critical of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.
A December survey sponsored by Third Way and conducted by HIT Strategies found that more than one-third of young Republican men viewed Mr Trump’s opposition to releasing the full files as “very concerning”.
The poll suggests that the Epstein investigation is a concern for young male voters across the political spectrum. Overall, well over half the respondents said it was very concerning, including more than three-quarters of Democrats and over half of independents.
In a statement, Ms Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, argued that the President had “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him”.
As to the young conservatives in his coalition, she added: “President Trump continues to deliver on many campaign promises that are important to young voters – stopping Biden’s inflation crisis, cutting taxes, making home ownership more accessible, bringing good-paying jobs back to the United States, and he’s just getting started.”
Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the Republican who, with Mr Ro Khanna, a Democratic member of Congress from California, has pressured the administration to release all of the Epstein files, said he believed young voters possessed an acute sense for when someone is being disingenuous.
“Everyone gets trained to accept a certain level of BS,” Mr Massie said in an interview. “When you’re younger, that detector is far more sensitive. And this is an issue where the BS being spewed by politicians right now is easily detected.”
Ms Maulding, who supported Mr Trump in the 2024 presidential election, the first she was old enough to vote in, is part of a generation that formed its political consciousness as the investigation of Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide while awaiting federal trial in 2019, loomed large. It was this event that “kick-started” her interest in politics, she said.
Today, she aligns with the America First wing of the conservative movement – which sits to the right of the MAGA movement – and hosts a podcast focusing on her anti-porn and anti-immigrant views.
Describing the protection of vulnerable women and children as the “ultimate hill to die on”, Ms Maulding said she felt a sense of “betrayal” over Attorney-General Pam Bondi’s combative appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last week, in which Ms Bondi refused to apologise to Epstein survivors in the hearing room.
“She couldn’t care less about the trauma and pain of the victims,” Ms Maulding said.
Mr Massie suggested that a politician’s stance on the Epstein scandal could function as a “magic mirror” for young people on the right determining who to support.
He urged them to “write off anybody who is not actively supporting this cause”. “Hold up that mirror and see what people are saying. A lot of people are being exposed as hacks right now.”
Young conservatives are beginning to scrutinise the anti-establishment pundits and influencers who once fanned the flames of Epstein-related conspiracy theories and storylines, noticing a stark difference now that some of the files have been released.
Take the Student Action Summit hosted by Turning Point USA in Tampa, Florida, in July.
Addressing several thousand young conservatives in the audience, a marquee list of conservative commentators – including Ms Laura Ingraham, Mr Tucker Carlson, and Mr Steve Bannon, the former top aide to Trump during his first administration who is seen in the files advising Epstein on how to weather resurfaced allegations that he was a serial paedophile – argued that the Epstein files represented an existential issue for the MAGA movement.
“Epstein is the key that picks the lock on so many things,” Mr Bannon said, addressing the conference during a fiery speech, as he called for an investigation led by a special prosecutor. “It’s a time for choosing. Now.”
Half a year later, many of these voices have appeared reluctant to weigh in further on Epstein. Some of the right’s preferred podcasts and livestreams, dependable outlets for outrage and conspiracy theories about the so-called deep state, have largely avoided discussion of the latest document releases.
In the rare instances when Epstein is invoked as a political concern – such as on the nightly stream of Mr Nick Fuentes, the young white-nationalist pundit – it is often to promote antisemitic views.
“I don’t know what to make of the radio silence,” said Mr Stryder Bigler, 23, who oversees a network of young far-right content creators in Phoenix. “I do know that it’s deteriorated our trust for these new media figures. Slowly, they’ve become the establishment media. They’re essentially like Fox News now.”
These one-time Trump supporters say they have begun to look beyond the President’s movement toward figures and ideas oriented even further to the right.
They are looking to politicians like Mr Massie, a frequent Trump critic, as well as Mr James Fishback, a candidate in the Republican primary for governor in Florida who is running against a Trump-endorsed candidate on an anti-tech, anti-immigration platform that includes calls to eliminate the H-1B visa programme in the state.
Mr Fishback, a 31-year-old investment firm CEO, has called for the “public execution” of anyone convicted of sex trafficking crimes in association with Epstein.
“We’re tired of moderates,” said Ms Maulding, who noted that she had been following Mr Fishback’s campaign. “He’s bold, and that’s what we really need right now.”
Mr Bigler seemed to agree. “Why should we continue with the MAGA coalition if this was the result?” he asked. NYTIMES

US strike kills three on boat in eastern Pacific
February 21, 2026US forces launched a strike that killed three alleged drug traffickers in a boat in the eastern Pacific, the military said on Friday.
"Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations" along an apparent narco-trafficking route, the US Southern Command posted on X, adding that "three male narco-terrorists were killed during this action."
A video linked to the post shows a boat floating motionlessly in the water before bursting into flames.
Fighting drug trafficking or extrajudicial killing?
The US military began targeting what it has claimed are drug smuggling boats in early September, killing at least 148 people in at least 43 attacks. There have been six known attacks on boats this year.
Under President Donald Trump, the United States has conducted the strikes without offering evidence of illegal activity, leading legal experts to raise concerns that the deaths could be considered extrajudicial killings.
The Trump administration has insisted the strikes are needed to combat drug trafficking.
Before the current military mission destroying small vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, the US Coast Guard and police were responsible for fighting illegal drug smuggling. Suspects taken into custody were treated as criminals not terrorists.
The Coast Guard still stops suspected drug-trafficking boats in the eastern Pacific without using lethal force.

'He failed for 30 years': Former national security adviser criticizes Netanyahu's Oct. 7 defense
Israel's former national security adviser criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's defense of the intelligence failures leading up to Hamas' October 7 attacks at an anti-government demonstration in Tel Aviv.
Speaking to a crowd in Tel Aviv's Habima Square, Eyal Hulata criticized a document Netanyahu submitted in December to the State Comptroller's Office as part of its probe into the attack.
"The Prime Minister is trying to claim that he wanted to promote an offensive policy, but everyone prevented him from doing so. What is the Prime Minister actually saying?" Hulata asked, before answering: "That for 30 years, he failed to move the system to carry out what he thought was necessary." According to Hulata, the prime minister should have put "the intelligence community on notice."
"Netanyahu knows this well but was incapable of doing it." The former adviser said. "He is convinced that the system is persecuting him. Not only did he refuse to accept the assessments, he avoided meeting with the heads of the security establishment and even bragged on Channel 14 that 'the military's warnings are exaggerated.'"
Hulata stated that "the question that must stand before the eyes of every citizen in the State of Israel is what kind of government they want to have here? one that evades responsibility and blames everyone but itself? Or one that is committed through its actions to the security and well-being of its residents?"
'I boiled with rage': Sister of slain hostage slams culture minister over 'massacre' remarks
The sister of slain hostage Itay Svirsky said she "boiled with rage" after hearing Culture Minister Miki Zohar's comments on the request to remove the word "massacre" from the title of a bill for the commemoration of the Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023.
Speaking at the weekly anti-government demonstrations in Haifa's Horev Center, Merav Svirsky criticized the move, saying: "Maybe the Prime Minister and Minister Zohar were at the event – but in the Western Negev communities, a massacre and abandonment took place."
Svirsky, whose parents, Orit and Rafi, were murdered on October 7 at Kibbutz Be'eri, noted that "for hours upon hours, entire communities, families, and children were left alone against the cruel evil of Hamas."
"There was also an ongoing abandonment of the hostages," she said. "Forty-six of them, including my brother, who were supposed to return alive, were killed and murdered in captivity."
Svirsky also criticized Prime Minister Netanyahu and the connection between his associates and Qatar, asking: "How can it be that the same funds used for the massacre in which my parents were murdered are the funds that flowed into the Prime Minister's Office during the management of the war?"
Hezbollah preparing for possible U.S.-Iran war, Saudi media reports
Hezbollah has increased the frequency of its meetings as it plans its response to a possible war between the United States and Iran, Saudi-owned outlets Al Arabiya and Al Hadath reported, citing Lebanese sources.
According to the sources, the militant Shi'ite group is no longer administered by its Lebanese leadership, but by Iranian commanders from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Some IRGC commanders have been stationed in Lebanon for some time, the sources said, while others have arrived more recently as U.S.-Iran tensions heightened.
The sources added that IRGC commanders are spearheading efforts to rebuild Hezbollah's capabilities and are meeting with the group's operatives to pass on instructions and guidelines.
The status of Hezbollah's Bekaa Valley missile unit – the target of Israeli strikes on Friday – was a primary focus of several meetings. Hezbollah expects a full-scale outbreak of hostilities with Israel, the sources indicated, noting that it is now merely a matter of timing.
Report: Two Palestinians wounded by Israeli settler gunfire, barn torched
Two Palestinians were wounded Saturday after armed Israeli settlers opened fire on residents in the village of al-Mughayyir, northeast of Ramallah, Palestinian media reported.
According to reports, settlers invaded a local family's compound south of the village and destroyed their property.
Separately, Palestinian media reported that settlers torched an agricultural structure on the outskirts of the nearby village of Abu Falah.
Report: Hezbollah says 'no choice but to fight' after Israeli strikes kill at least eight operatives
A Hezbollah spokesman described Israel's strikes in the Bekaa Valley Friday as "a new massacre and a new aggression," Saudi-owned Al Arabiya reported.
In a speech broadcast on Hezbollah's television channel Al-Manar, Deputy Chairman of Hezbollah's Political Council, Mahmoud Qamati, said the group "no longer has any option" but to defend itself.
"What option do we have left to defend ourselves and our country?" he said, "What option do we have other than resistance?"
The eight Hezbollah members targeted in the strike were attending a meeting when they were killed, AFP reported, citing an unnamed Hezbollah official.
Students protest at elite Iranian university as new term begins
New protests against Iran's authoritarian system of rule broke out on Saturday as the new semester got underway at one of the country's best-known universities.
Students at the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran gathered and shouted protest slogans, activists reported on social media. The student newsletter Amirkabir reported that there were also clashes with the regime's paramilitary Basij units.
Further protests were organized by medical students in the north-eastern city of Mashhad.
Eyewitnesses in Tehran confirmed the new protests at Sharif University, which is considered an elite university. Larger demonstrations took place there during earlier waves of protest, for example during the "Woman, Life, Freedom' movement."
Videos from the Amirkabir channel, which was honored with the Aachen Peace Prize last year, showed crowds of people on the campus. Arrests were made in the course of the protests.
"Long live the Shah" could be heard on one video - a reference to Reza Pahlavi, son of the Shah who was overthrown in 1979 and has since risen to become one of the best-known opposition figures abroad.
According to the Iranian news agency Mehr, the new semester begins on Saturday at Iranian universities after a delay of over a month. The universities had initially suspended operations as a result of the mass protests at the beginning of January.
Some universities recently resumed teaching with online courses after the authorities shut down global internet access in the country for more than three weeks.
RECAP: PA, OIC, and Arab League condemn Huckabee’s ‘Greater Israel’ remarks in Carlson interview
Here are Saturday's key updates on Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and the Middle East:
■ The Palestinian Authority "strongly condemned" U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee for comments suggesting it would be "fine" if Israel took over much of the Middle East.
■ The Secretary-General of the League of Arab States characterized the ambassador's comments to far-right pundit Tucker Carlson as "highly extremist statements." The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) described the remarks as "unacceptable."
■ Lebanese President Joseph Aoun accused Israel of undermining diplomatic efforts to stabilize the country after the latest deadly strikes on Hezbollah positions.
■ Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that 3,117 people, including about 200 police officers, were killed in anti-government protests.
■ Hundreds of U.S. troops have been evacuated from military bases in Qatar and Bahrain, the New York Times reported, citing Pentagon officials.
■ The IDF said its troops killed a militant in the area of the Israeli-controlled Yellow Line in the northern Gaza Strip.
Arab League condemns Huckabee's 'Greater Israel' remarks as 'highly extremist'
The League of Arab States on Saturday condemned U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee for comments suggesting it would be "fine" if Israel took over much of the Middle East.
Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the league's Secretary-General, described the ambassador's comments to far-right pundit Tucker Carlson as "highly extremist statements."
Aboul Gheit characterized the remarks in a statement as "contrary to logic and reason," and "inconsistent with the fundamental principles and established norms of diplomacy."
The Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), comprised of 57 Muslim-majority nations, described the ambassador's remarks as "unacceptable."
Both groups warned that Huckabee's remarks could inflame regional tensions. The OIC reiterated its support for a two-state solution, while the Arab League backed the "Gaza peace agreement" and U.S. President Donald Trump's "Board of Peace."
Iranian President says Tehran will not bow to pressure amid U.S. nuclear talks
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that his country would not bow its head to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the United States.
"World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads... but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us," Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live by state TV.
U.S. Ambassador Huckabee clarifies Zionism stance after Tucker Carlson interview
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee refined his position on Zionism Saturday after a heated interview with far-right pundit Tucker Carlson Friday.
"Tucker and I had a very twisty and frankly confusing discussion about the meaning of Zionism," Huckabee said in a post on X, before clarifying that "Zionism is the belief that Israel has a right to exist in safety and security. That's it."
The ambassador added that many Christian Zionists support the movement as they believe in "Israel's right to exist in safety and security."
Huckabee confronted Carlson, saying he "couldn't get you to say you support Israel's right to exist during our interview."
"Why can't you just say that?" The ambassador asked. "I asked you multiple times during our interview and not once did you give me a direct answer." Huckabee stated he wished Carlson would answer his "that simple question soon."

Tucker Carlson claims Israel targeted his family, Netanyahu ‘believes in blood guilt’
In program including interview with Huckabee, right-wing commentator launches litany of unsubstantiated claims echoing antisemitic tropes, falsely says Herzog visited Epstein island
In a program released Friday following his brief visit to Israel, right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson claimed the Israeli government targeted his family, called the Jewish state “probably the most violent country on earth” and falsely said President Isaac Herzog had visited Jeffrey Epstein’s infamous island, apparently citing a fake AI-generated image that had circulated online.
He also called Israel a police state, questioned its right to exist and the historic ties of the Jewish population to the land, accused the country of controlling US policy, and made various other unsupported claims associated with antisemitic tropes.
Carlson, a leading critic of Israel on the right, came to Israel on Wednesday to interview US Ambassador Mike Huckabee. According to some reports, he never left the airport area and departed immediately afterward. The Friday program included his interview with Huckabee as well as solo segments in which he railed against Israel.
Speaking alone, Carlson said: “There was a threat to my family. The Israeli government, and [Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu himself, tried to punish two members of my family. I won’t be more specific, but actually punish two members of my family because he, as he has said in public many times, believes in blood guilt, Amalek. You know, when someone commits a crime against you, you punish not just him, but his family, his bloodline.”
Carlson did not give any more details or offer evidence to substantiate his claim. Netanyahu has never stated that he believes in “blood guilt” or in collective punishment of Israel’s enemies. His mention of the biblical Amalekites in the wake of the October 7 attack was a reference to genocidal threats to the people of Israel throughout history.
Carlson went on: “There’s no idea that’s less Western than that, more anti-Christian than that. Christians reject that. Netanyahu doesn’t. That’s why he’s talking about Amalek, and he was going after my family, literally, so I felt very threatened by that.”
During his interview with Huckabee, the right-wing pundit pressed Huckabee about Herzog’s supposed visits to Epstein’s island, although there is no evidence that Herzog had any connection to Epstein or visited his property.
“The current president of Israel, whom I know you know, apparently was at ‘pedo island.’ That’s what it says,” Carlson said. “Still-living, high-level Israeli officials are directly implicated in Epstein’s life, if not his crimes, so I think you’d be following this.”
Former prime minister Ehud Barak was friendly with Epstein, but there is no evidence of any criminality on Barak’s part.
Huckabee said he had not followed news about the Epstein files because it was not relevant to his job.
“I was not aware there was any connection with President Herzog. I would be surprised to hear that,” Huckabee said.
“I don’t know that I’ve heard the current president of Israel respond to it, but he is listed as a visitor to ‘pedo island,’ so that’s kind of a big deal,” Carlson said, criticizing Huckabee for not questioning Herzog about Epstein.
“This is the first I’ve heard of this, so why do you expect me to have knowledge like that?” Huckabee answered.
The ambassador later said he asked Herzog about Carlson’s claims and shared what he said was a statement from the President’s Residence refuting them.
“The allegations are entirely unfounded and are unequivocally denied. There has never been any contact or connection, directly or indirectly, between Isaac Herzog and Jeffrey Epstein. There was never any acquaintance or personal relationship of any kind between them. The president was never invited to, never visited, and was never present at the location in question,” Herzog’s office was quoted as saying.
“Any claim suggesting otherwise is false and may constitute libel and defamation.”
Herzog is mentioned in the Epstein files, but only in news reports that landed in Epstein’s emails. There is no evidence of a personal connection between Herzog and Epstein. After the files’ release late last month, a fake, AI-generated image circulated online showing Herzog and Epstein together, amid rampant disinformation about the Epstein files, including widespread conspiracy theories about Jews and Israel.
While the claims are baseless, those who viewed the interview would not had any indication of their falsity. More than a million people viewed the interview on YouTube in the hours after its release, and the footage was also shared on other platforms.
Carlson is an influential and massively popular voice on the right who has a friendly relationship with US Vice President JD Vance.
‘Somewhat of a hyperbolic statement’
Also during the interview, Huckabee at one point said “it would be fine” if Israel took over so-called Greater Israel that the God of the Bible promised to Abraham, before backtracking to some degree and saying the comment was made hyperbolically.
Carlson was pressing the US envoy, a devout Christian, on his assertion that a part of the Jewish people’s right to the land stemmed from God’s promise to Abraham, while noting that that promised land spanned a far larger territory than that of today’s Israel, encompassing much of present-day’s Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He asked whether it did not follow then that Israel had a right to take land from neighboring Arab countries.
Huckabee, after initially avoiding the matter, eventually said, “It would be fine if they took it all,” while swiftly adding that this was not on the table as “They’re not asking to take it over.”
Carlson then asked the US ambassador to confirm he was fine with Israel taking over “all of Syria, all of Lebanon.” Huckabee responded, “That’s really not exactly what I’m trying to say,” adding that “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
In a subsequent back-and-forth, Carlson demanded to know whether Huckabee believes Israel “has a moral right to take over what are now other people’s countries,” as the envoy insisted he had not said that. Eventually, Huckabee said: “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, then, okay, that’s a whole other discussion.”
During the interview, Carlson also said it was “very clear” Epstein was affiliated with Mossad, another unsubstantiated allegation. A primary source in the Epstein files who alleged that Epstein worked for Mossad was a discredited fraudster and Holocaust denier.
After the interview aired, and Huckabee found out the allegations against Herzog were false, he wrote on X, “His allegations against Israeli officials could be the stuff of libel lawsuits. It was hard to follow Tucker’s line of questioning.”
I'm so glad that @LauraLoomer is setting fire to some of Tucker's bizarre allegations. His allegations against Israeli officials could be the stuff of libel lawsuits. It was hard to follow Tucker's line of questioning. https://t.co/nA3PwyWONL
— Ambassador Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) February 20, 2026
Carlson’s visit also caused controversy due to his claims that his team was targeted for “interrogation” by Israeli security.
Carlson did not leave the airport during the visit, but alleged that two of his producers were subject to hostile questioning. Huckabee and the Israel Airports Authority firmly rejected the claim.
‘Given the third degree’
In the introduction to his interview with Huckabee, before the envoy was present, Carlson said Israeli officials held his team’s passports and that his two producers were “called into rooms and given the third degree.” Carlson said security asked questions, including, “What did you say to the US ambassador?”
“They’re doing like an intel op and humiliation exercise on my producer. This isn’t security,” he said.
“The interrogator is holding his passport in his hand as he’s asking these questions,” he said. “Some thug is demanding details of that conversation.”
“It’s a police state, it’s a surveillance state. You go to Israel, and they put software on your phone. Everybody knows this. They’re constantly spying on you,” he said. There is no evidence that Israel installs spy software on visitors’ phones.
It is standard for Israeli airport staff to ask visitors questions while viewing their passports.
Carlson said footage leaked to the media with the goal of discrediting his claim of mistreatment was merely him agreeing to a driver’s request to take a photo with him.
He also claimed that Israel knowingly bombed the USS Liberty in 1967, a common conspiracy theory on the US far right.
Little common ground
During the introduction and Carlson’s interview with Huckabee, Carlson portrayed Israel as controlling the US and dragging the US into wars, echoing antisemitic tropes about hidden Jewish power and warmongering.
“Americans in the United States, can you be sure that your government will take your side over the Israeli government? No, of course not. They will always take the Israeli government’s side over yours and that’s the core problem,” he said.
“If you criticize Israel in your country, your government will censor you,” he said. Carlson and other prominent figures regularly criticize Israel without being censored.
Huckabee and Carlson remained relatively cordial but found little common ground and were often unable to agree on basic facts.
For example, as Carlson warned that Israel was endangering US troops, Huckabee attempted to point out that American troops have never fought for Israel. Carlson, however, repeatedly responded with the baseless claim that the Iraq War was fought at Israel’s behest, and alleged that Israel was prodding the US into war with Iran.
“I don’t think that it’s at all accurate to even intimate that tiny, little Israel is pushing the US into something it does not want to do,” Huckabee said.
“Prime Minister Netanyahu has way more influence over American foreign policy than Americans do,” Carlson said.
Carlson also questioned Israel’s right to exist and the ties of Jewish Israelis to the land, engaging in a byzantine discussion about indigeneity that included questions about whether Jews are an ethnicity or a religion, ancient history like the building of Stonehenge and genetics in Scandinavia. Huckabee said several times he was unable to follow Carlson’s train of reasoning.
Some of Carlson’s arguments echoed points made on the far left. He repeatedly accused Israel of murdering journalists, cast Jewish Israelis as foreign implants in Israel, accused Israel of genocide and attacked US financial aid to Israel. While anti-Zionist activists often accuse Israel of persecuting Muslims at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Carlson accused Israel of blocking Christian Palestinians from accessing the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

Gunmen on motorcycles kill at least 50 in northwest Nigeria: Report
Nigerian lawmaker reports ‘at least 50 people dead’ after attack as list of missing is still being compiled.
Gunmen killed at least 50 people and abducted women and children in an overnight assault on a village in northwestern Nigeria’s Zamfara State, authorities and residents said.
The attack started late on Thursday night and continued into Friday morning in Tungan Dutse village in the Bukkuyum area of Zamfara when armed men arrived on motorcycles and began setting fire to buildings and abducting residents.

“They have been moving from one village to another … leaving at least 50 people dead,” said Hamisu A Faru, a lawmaker representing Bukkuyum South.
Faru, speaking to the Reuters news agency by phone on Friday, said the number of people abducted remained unclear as local officials were still compiling lists of the missing.
Residents say warning signs were visible before the attack.
Abdullahi Sani, 41, said villagers alerted security forces after spotting more than 150 motorcycles carrying armed men a day earlier, but no action was taken.
“No one slept yesterday; we are all in pain,” Sani said, adding that three members of his family were killed in the attack.
Areas of Nigeria’s north and west continue to grapple with overlapping security threats, including armed criminal gangs and rebel fighters.
Just last week, at least 46 people were killed in raids in the Borgu area of northwest Niger State. The deadliest assault occurred in the village of Konkoso, where at least 38 residents were shot or had their throats cut, according to reports.
The crisis has drawn increased international involvement.
Nigeria recently expanded security cooperation with the United States after President Donald Trump accused the country of failing to halt the killing of Christians and threatened military intervention.
On December 25, the US launched air strikes on the northern state of Sokoto, conducted in coordination with Nigerian authorities.
Earlier this week, Nigeria’s military confirmed the arrival of 100 US soldiers tasked with training local forces.
Samaila Uba, spokesperson for Nigeria’s Defence Headquarters, said the US troops would offer “technical support” and “intelligence sharing” to help combat “terrorist organisations”, along with “associated equipment”.
He stressed the US personnel would not engage directly in combat and would share technical expertise under Nigerian command.

Nauseda strips former Ukrainian education minister Tabachnyk of Lithuanian award over collaboration with Russia
Ukrinform reports this, citing Delfi.
According to the international online publication, Nauseda also ordered Tabachnyk to return the order and the award documents to the Chancellor of State Orders of Lithuania.
The report notes that Tabachnyk has disgraced his status as a recipient.
The former Ukrainian education minister received the Lithuanian state award in 1996, when Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas was president. At the time, Tabachnyk was honored as the former head of the Ukrainian Presidential Administration for contributions to developing intergovernmental relations between Lithuania and Ukraine.
"Currently, he is a citizen of Russia, which is conducting military aggression against Ukraine. On March 20, 2024, the Vinnytsia City Court found D. Tabachnyk guilty in absentia of collaborating with Russia under three articles of the Criminal Code of Ukraine," the Lithuanian presidential administration stated.
They added that on November 22, 2024, by decree of President Volodymyr Zelensky, Tabachnyk was stripped of Ukrainian state awards.
As previously reported, in February 2025, President Nauseda also revoked a state award of Lithuania from former Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov.

Trump to travel to China from March 31 to April 2, with US tariffs in focus
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 overturned Mr Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imported goods.
A White House official confirmed the trip on Feb 20, just before the highest US court dealt Mr Trump a stinging defeat by striking down many of the tariffs he has used in a global trade war,
His talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on an extended visit to Beijing had been expected to revolve around extending a trade truce that kept both countries from further hiking tariffs.
But the Supreme Court’s reversal created new questions for tense US-China relations that had recently stabilised after Mr Trump trimmed tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for measures from Beijing, including cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade and pausing export restrictions on critical minerals.
Twenty per cent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the court ruled he had overstepped. Those tariffs were tied to national emergencies related to fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances.
Other duties on Chinese goods, including those implemented under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232,
It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Mr Trump would restore, but he told a press conference that he would impose a new 10 per cent global tariff for 150 days.
Mr Trump’s last trip to China, in 2017, was the most recent by a US president.
“That’s going to be a wild one,” Mr Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Feb 19 about the upcoming China visit. “We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.”
The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the dates of the trip, which were first reported by Reuters. Beijing has not confirmed the trip.
The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary because of national emergencies related to trade imbalances that have weakened US manufacturing.
Mr Trump had already been “playing defence” in the trade war, given the effectiveness of Beijing’s threat to cut off rare earths, said Dr Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes”, he said. Chinese officials “like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the US is diminished, and they want to keep things from re-escalating”, Dr Kennedy said.
Mr Trump’s visit will be the leaders’ first in-person talks since an October meeting in South Korea, where they agreed on the trade truce.
While the October meeting largely sidestepped the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Mr Xi raised US arms sales to the island when the two leaders spoke this month.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position Taipei rejects. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, has formal diplomatic ties with China, but it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier. Washington announced its largest arms sale approval with Taiwan in December, including US$11.1 billion in weapons that could ostensibly be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects more such sales.
Mr Xi also said during the February call that he would consider further increasing soya bean purchases, according to Mr Trump. Struggling US farmers are a major political constituency for Mr Trump, and China is the top soya bean consumer.
Analysts said on Feb 20 that China may be less likely to follow through on another big purchase of US soya beans after the Supreme Court ruling. Although Mr Trump has justified hawkish policy steps from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela as necessary to thwart China, he has eased policy toward Beijing in the past several months in areas from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones.
The global trade war Mr Trump initiated after he began his second term as president in January 2025 has alienated other trading partners, including allies. Critics had argued that imposing steep tariffs on countries across the board actually insulated Beijing from the tariff barrage and reduced incentives to move supply chains out of China.
The ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Mr Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
“Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that makes them less affected than those on other countries,” Mr Chorzempa said. REUTERS

OpenAI considered alerting Canadian police about school shooting suspect months ago

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has said it considered alerting Canadian police last year about the activities of a person who months later committed one of the worst school shootings in the country’s history.
OpenAI said last June the company identified the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar via abuse detection efforts for “furtherance of violent activities”.
The San Francisco tech company said on Friday it considered whether to refer the account to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) but determined at the time that the account activity did not meet a threshold for referral to law enforcement.
OpenAI banned the account in June 2025 for violating its usage policy.
The 18-year-old killed eight people in a remote part of British Columbia last week and died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound.
OpenAI said the threshold for referring a user to law enforcement was whether the case involved an imminent and credible risk of serious physical harm to others. The company said it did not identify credible or imminent planning. The Wall Street Journal first reported OpenAI’s revelation.
OpenAI said that, after learning of the school shooting, employees reached out to the RCMP with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT.
“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”
The RCMP said Van Rootselaar first killed her mother and stepbrother at the family home before attacking the nearby school. Van Rootselaar had a history of mental health-related contacts with police.
The motive for the shooting remains unclear.
The town of 2,700 people in the Canadian Rockies is more than 1,000km (600 miles) north-east of Vancouver, near the provincial border with Alberta.
Police said the victims included a 39-year-old teaching assistant and five students, aged 12 to 13.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest rampage since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.

Sometimes, silence speaks louder than words. The latest global university ranking, which was conducted by researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands, has caused a stir in Western media outlets like the New York Times and Le Monde, which noted the meteoric rise of Chinese universities – eight of which made it into the top 10. Normally, such results spark national pride on Chinese social media and give Beijing's mouthpieces an opportunity to sing the praises of the new mantra of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC): "The East is rising, the West is declining."
Paradoxically, the Dutch ranking has become a source of ridicule among Chinese internet users, who were astonished to see that Oxford University had been beaten by Zhengzhou University. The deafening silence of the official media has revealed the regime's embarrassment; the Leiden ranking, which is based on the number of scientific publications, has mainly reminded the Chinese public of the ongoing scandals involving paper mills – operations that produce paid-for scientific articles on demand. On January 23, the National Natural Science Foundation of China published a list of 46 academics sanctioned for "fraudulent behavior in the publication of scientific research." This is just the tip of the iceberg of xueshu fubai ("academic corruption") that has plagued the country's universities for three decades.
However, it would be unfair to blame Chinese researchers and scientists, who are no less competent or brilliant than their foreign peers, for causing such a calamity. Scientific fraud and the pressure to "publish or perish" exist everywhere, but the pressure has reached another level in the People's Republic of China (PRC), where the sole party, which holds absolute sway over academic careers, has made the number of publications the primary evaluation criterion – even for high school teachers. It is hardly surprising that the PRC overtook the US as early as 2017 in the ranking of scientific publications. Despite the regime's constant promise of "zero tolerance" toward xueshu fubai, Beijing has let paper mills prosper. Many CPC officials caught up in anti-corruption campaigns have been found with fake degrees and doctored publications on their résumés.

Will Thailand’s election be voided? Bar code blunder threatens to tear up results
With counting errors forcing revotes this Sunday, the reformist opposition is seizing on irregularities to demand a fresh election
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
Two weeks after an election that was called to cut through Thailand’s political stalemate, much is still in doubt.
The threat of annulment hangs over the entire vote, while the final shape of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul’s governing coalition is still being formed.
The February 8 poll, called by Anutin’s caretaker government to seek a fresh mandate, aimed to halt the revolving door at Government House that saw three prime ministers come and go in just two years.

In that time, an economy that was once the star of Southeast Asia has slowed to its weakest growth in decades.
Anutin’s Bhumjaithai stormed to a surprise victory at the poll, emerging as the largest party with more than 190 seats. Most voters, for the first time in a generation, actively turned to conservative leadership to tackle economic woes and end years of political upheaval.

China’s AI crossroads: 3 divergent paths in the race for dominance
AI rivalry is challenging the traditional strategies of China’s ‘big tech’ firms and how they have monetised their products in the past
On a crisp January afternoon, the Shenzhen Bay Sports Centre, just a stone’s throw from Tencent Holdings’ headquarters, was packed with employees gathering for a party featuring celebrity cameos and prizes. But before the fun started, they witnessed a round of sober self-reflection from their low-profile leader.
The New Year address by co-founder, chairman and CEO Pony Ma Huateng is an annual tradition for the social media and video gaming giant, offering its 115,000 employees rare insight into what is top of mind for their boss, who seldom accepts media interviews or makes public comments.
Ma, 54, touched on many topics – including gaming, cloud computing and China’s food delivery price wars – but it was his take on Tencent’s artificial intelligence efforts that was striking for most employees, some of whom later shared his comments with the South China Morning Post.
“We were actually slow in taking action [on AI],” Ma told them.
While his description of the company’s “measured pace” aligned with Tencent’s track record of being a steady and stable player among China’s “big tech” firms, the moment of soul-searching stood in contrast to a global AI race that has witnessed exponential growth and a proliferation of applications.
Unlike peers like Alibaba Group Holding, who are vocal about their spending targets for AI, Tencent sticks to quarterly results. It reported that capital expenditure across all sectors in the third quarter of last year was 13 billion yuan (US$1.88 billion).

Renovated former milk bar in Melbourne’s inner north sells for $5.1m at auction

By Wes Mountain
A family home of 45 years in Bentleigh East sold at auction for $1.8 million on Saturday, after a tense bidding war between three keen buyers.
The two-storey, four-bedroom converted bungalow at 4 Wallace Street, with a price guide of $1.5 to $1.6 million, was extended in 2000. While updated with a new kitchen, solar panels and water tanks, the original timber skirting and floorboards were preserved throughout.
Woodards Bentleigh agent and auctioneer Ben Quigley said it had been a good campaign, with many interested bidders who all turned up on the day.
Bidding started at $1.5 million, immediately hitting the $1.6 million reserve on the second bid.
A young couple narrowly beat a pair of investors, with bids inching up in $5000 and $2000 increments, and both parties almost bowing out at multiple points.
“It certainly gives a good indication of what the family home is worth now,” Quigley said. “And the vendors, what they’ve done for this house, they deserve it.”
The vendors, who are retiring to Gippsland, said they were “hanging off the doorframes” as the price went $200,000 over the reserve.
“It’s been a great place to bring up our daughter,” they said. “If we could pick this house up and move it, it would be wonderful, but you can’t do that.”
The property was one of 1257 scheduled to go to auction in Melbourne this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 66.4 per cent from 955 reported results throughout the week, while 95 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
In the city’s inner north-east, an Alphington townhouse backing onto parkland sold under the hammer for $1,575,000.
The three-bedroom home at 4/8 Coate Avenue, part of an English mews-style gated estate, has four-metre-high ceilings and a feature chandelier. It had a price guide of $1,375,000 to $1.5 million.
Michael Lang, Savills auctioneer and agent, said bidding started slowly at $1.4 million, with two bidders gradually pushing the price up by $10,000 and $20,000 increments, before moving to $5000 bids.
By the time it passed the $1,485,000 reserve, the pace had picked up and Lang said he had to race to confirm it was on the market.
“It was rocketing up,” he said. “The first bid was a bit tough, then the second one, and then it just rolled on rapidly after that.”
He said the winning bidders, a couple in their 50s, narrowly beat a younger professional couple, who were first home buyers. The vendors had been looking to upsize, he said, and would be happy with the result.
A lavishly renovated former milk bar in Fitzroy North sold for $5.1 million at auction, almost $1 million over its reserve.
The four-bedroom, Victorian weatherboard home at 558 Rae Street was updated by local architects Kennedy Nolan. It has a landscaped central courtyard, exposed concrete and timber details throughout.
With a price guide of $3.9 million to $4.3 million, bidding started at a “cheeky” $3.2 million, Nelson Alexander Fitzroy auctioneer and lead agent Mark Verrocchi said.
After a vendor bid of $3.9 million, bidding leapt up “very quickly”, he said, in increments of $20,000 and $50,000, before hitting the reserve of $4.2 million.
Verrocchi said a “rapid fire” auction pace, with four young families and a couple in their 50s competing, led to a quick sale.
The buyers, a young family, already had siblings in the area.
Verrocchi said the vendors were returning to their hometown in Newcastle, NSW, where they hoped to repeat their success with another renovated home.
In the heart of Coburg, a former laundromat and grocery fetched $1.13 million at auction, almost 15 per cent over reserve.
The updated three-bedroom Edwardian sits on a corner at 105 Munro Street, and had a price guide of $900,000 to $990,000.
It features Baltic pine floors, a timber dining nook and pink accents in the kitchen and bathroom.
Barry Plant agent and auctioneer Jarrod Couch said there was “a bit of history in the building”, including a study which preserved the original shopfront.
Couch started with a vendor bid of $900,000, and the bidding began in earnest at $910,000.
Bidding crept up in $10,000 increments, with three bidders competing to easily pass the $990,000 reserve. A couple in their 30s won the day to land their first home.
The vendors, who moved to NSW to retire four to five years ago, had recently been renting out the home.
“They’ve got no plans to come back to Melbourne, and decided now’s the time to move it on,” Couch said.
He said his two auctions this year had both sold reasonably comfortably, and thought more broadly that buyers hadn’t been intimidated by recent interest rate increases.

Israel says it hit Hezbollah sites in eastern Lebanon
February 21, 2026At least 10 people were killed and 24 wounded in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley on Friday, Lebanon's Health Ministry reported.
Israel's military said in a statement that it had hit Hezbollah command centers.
The strikes are among the deadliest reported in the region in recent weeks.
A senior Hezbollah official was among the dead, sources told Reuters news agency. Unnamed sources within the militant group later told news agencies that eight Hezbollah members were among those killed.
Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, while the EU lists its armed wing as a terrorist group.
Hamas targeted in southern Lebanon
Separately, the Israeli military on Friday said it had also struck what it said was a Hamas command center from which militants operated in the Ain al-Hilweh area in southern Lebanon.
Ain al-Hilweh is a crowded Palestinian refugee camp.
Hamas condemned the Israeli strike on Ain al-Hilweh.
The militant, Islamist group acknowledged that two of its members had been killed in the strike.
However, it rejected Israel's claim of targeting a command center, slamming it as a "flimsy pretext."
The building targeted belonged to a joint security force tasked with maintaining security in the camp, Hamas said.
The Israeli military said it "is operating against the entrenchment" of the Palestinian militant group in Lebanon and will "continue to act decisively against Hamas terrorists wherever they operate."
Hamas is classified as a terror organization by the US, Germany and several other countries.
A fragile ceasefire
Almost immediately after the attack on Israel led by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas on October 7, 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel in support of Hamas and Palestinians.
Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling.
The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024.
The US then brokered a ceasefire in November 2024, but it remains tenuous.
Israel has launched regular strikes on Lebanon despite the truce, saying it is targeting militants from Hezbollah and sometimes Hamas.
Lebanon's government last year committed to disarming Hezbollah.
The Lebanese army recently said it had completed the first phase of the plan, covering the area near the Israeli border.
But Israel has criticized the Lebanese army's progress as insufficient.
It has also accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and rearm.

British police contacting security officers who once protected former Prince Andrew

LONDON – British police on Feb 20 said they were contacting royal protection officers who might have information about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince, a day after his arrest
The announcement from the Metropolitan Police in London added that authorities were aware of suggestions that the city’s airports “may have been used to facilitate human trafficking and sexual exploitation”. A private jet used by Epstein was nicknamed the “Lolita express” and was said to have brought women into the country.
The investigation into Mountbatten-Windsor continued on a separate track on Feb 20, as officers from the Thames Valley Police searched a mansion that had been occupied until recently by the former prince in connection with allegations that he may have shared confidential government information.
Mountbatten-Windsor was questioned until late on Feb 19 at a police station in Norfolk, England, over accusations of misconduct in public office. This takes place when someone performing a job on behalf of the British public “willfully neglects to perform their duty” or “willfully misconducts themselves” in abusing the public trust. It carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment upon conviction.

Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Feb 19, is a younger brother of King Charles III.
His arrest came after the US Department of Justice released millions of documents in January in connection with Epstein. Reports suggest that Mountbatten-Windsor may have shared confidential government information with the disgraced financier while serving as a British trade envoy.
Mountbatten-Windsor has not so far been charged.
In their statement on Feb 20, the Metropolitan Police said they were “identifying and contacting former and serving officers who may have worked closely, in a protection capacity, with Andrew Mountbatten‑Windsor.”
The officers were being asked “whether anything they saw or heard during that period of service may be relevant to our ongoing reviews,” the statement added.
Close protection officers provide security for senior members of the royal family, giving them detailed knowledge of their meetings and travel schedules.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who has not spoken publicly or responded to requests for comment in recent months, has always denied any wrongdoing. NYTIMES

OpenAI flagged Canadian school shooter months before massacre but did not alert police
Despite detecting a misuse of ChatGPT for ‘violent intent’, OpenAI felt the risk did not meet its bar for police referral
OpenAI said the company identified the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar last June via abuse detection efforts for “furtherance of violent activities”.
The San Francisco tech company said it considered whether to refer the account to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police but determined at the time that the account activity did not meet a threshold for referral to law enforcement. OpenAI banned the account in June 2025 for violating its usage policy.
OpenAI said the threshold for referring a user to law enforcement was whether the case involves an imminent and credible risk of serious physical harm to others. The company said it did not identify credible or imminent planning. The Wall Street Journal first reported OpenAI’s revelation.
OpenAI said that, after learning of the school shooting, employees reached out to the Canadian police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT.
“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy. We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation,” OpenAI said in a statement.

South Korea Says US Trade Deal Still Intact After Tariff Ruling
South Korea said a US Supreme Court ruling striking down tariffs imposed under President Donald Trump’s emergency powers would not derail its broader trade agreement with Washington.
Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan held an emergency meeting Saturday to assess the decision, which found tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act unlawful. The ruling renders void the 15% reciprocal tariff currently applied to Korean goods, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Resources said in a statement.

The US trade statutes Trump will use to keep imposing tariffs: A look at sections 122, 232 and 301
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
The Feb 20 Supreme Court ruling keep taxing imports
Mr Trump, speaking from the White House, referenced the dissent from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who noted that “the Court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward”.
In addition to Section 122, Mr Trump said he would use two other trade statutes – one that allows the president to impose tariffs on specific products and another that allows for tariffs on an entire country.
All of these options are far less nimble than the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Mr Trump used to impose – or threaten – tariffs on a whim. And they could also be subjected to a legal challenge.
Here is a look at the trade provisions Mr Trump says he will invoke:
Section 122
Mr Trump said that he would put in place a 10 per cent global tariff using Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act. The levies would go into effect in about three days, the President said.
The statute says a president can impose duties to deal with “large and serious” balance-of-payments deficits – an issue related to trade deficits, which some of Mr Trump’s IEEPA tariffs purport to address. But it also imposes a 150-day limit on the tariffs, unless Congress votes to extend them.
At least temporarily, it would not be dissimilar from the baseline 10 per cent tariff that he had imposed globally, or the 15 per cent tariff that he had clinched in deals with other countries over the past year.
Mr Clark Packard at the conservative Cato Institute noted that Section 122 would allow Mr Trump to act fast. But a lot remains to be seen about its actual power. “With the statute never previously invoked, there’s no judicial precedent clarifying its limits,” Mr Packard wrote.
Section 232
One powerful option in Mr Trump’s toolbox is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, which allows the president to impose tariffs on foreign products in the interest of national security. Mr Trump has already subjected a widening roster of goods to these duties, including cars, steel and copper, along with other goods.
The President did not indicate whether he planned additional trade actions using Section 232 but said all existing tariffs under the statute would remain in place.
Unlike the IEEPA, which Mr Trump had used until Feb 20 to impose tariffs immediately, Section 232 requires a Commerce Department investigation into whether an import poses a national security risk. By law, the commerce secretary has 270 days to present findings from the investigation to the president. If the investigation determines that a specific import poses a national security threat, the president can impose tariffs.
So far, roughly 10 per cent of US imports are subjected to Section 232 tariffs.
Section 301
The President said he would use another set of powers, Section 301, to open investigations into unfair trade practices, which could yield additional tariffs.
Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act allows him to impose duties after conducting an investigation and finding that a country engaged in trade practices that were unfair, unreasonable or violations of previously signed trade deals.
Mr Trump has repeatedly invoked this power since his first term in office, primarily to impose steep tariffs on China, whose leader, President Xi Jinping, he is set to meet in the coming weeks.
In 2025, Mr Trump also opened an investigation into Brazil using Section 301, as part of a series of actions he took in response to that country’s treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, his political ally. NYTIMES

Trump, JD Vance vilify ‘lawless’ Supreme Court justices over tariff ruling
President Trump calls Supreme Court justices an ’embarrassment to their families’ in 45-minute address to the media.
United States President Donald Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, have launched personal attacks on the justices of the US Supreme Court and their families, after the country’s top court struck down trade tariffs imposed by the White House.
In a 45-minute address to reporters at the White House, the US president heaped criticism on the six justices who ruled against his signature tariff policy in the 6-3 decision by the court on Friday, including Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, whom Trump appointed to the court during his first term.

“I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, you wanna know the truth, the two of them,” Trump said, referring to Justices Gorsuch and Barrett.
“I’m ashamed of certain members of the court – absolutely ashamed – for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” Trump added.
Shockingly, Trump also claimed that the Supreme Court “has been swayed by foreign interests”, without providing any evidence.
Trump then warmly praised the three members of the court who dissented in the ruling.
“I’d like to thank and congratulate Justices [Clarence] Thomas, [Samuel] Alito, and [Brett] Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is, right now, very proud of those justices,” Trump said.
“When you read the dissenting opinions, there’s no way that anyone can argue against them,” he said.
Vice President Vance also sharply criticised the justices for their ruling, accusing them of “lawlessness” in a post on X.
“Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to ‘regulate imports’, didn’t actually mean it,” Vance wrote in a post on X.
“This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple,” said Vance, whose political profile rose to prominence after writing a memoir about his time at Yale Law School.
Trump and Vance’s comments mark a rare rebuke of the nine-member Supreme Court, which currently has six members appointed by Trump’s Republican Party and has often ruled in favour of his administration’s policies.

Brazil, India target critical minerals deal as Modi and Lula meet in New Delhi

Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are meeting in New Delhi, seeking to strengthen cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths as global supply chains face mounting pressure.
Lula, leading a delegation of ministers and business representatives, arrived in the Indian capital on Wednesday for a global summit.
Officials said the two leaders are expected to sign a memorandum on critical minerals and discuss ways to expand trade ties.
Brazil holds the world's second-largest reserves of rare earth elements, which are used in electric vehicles, solar panels, smartphones, jet engines and guided missiles.
India, aiming to reduce dependence on leading exporter China, has expanded domestic production and recycling while seeking new suppliers abroad.
Bilateral trade between the two countries exceeded $15 billion in 2025, making India the 10th largest market for Brazilian exports.
Both sides have set a target of $20 billion in trade by 2030.
With China maintaining a near-monopoly on rare earth production, countries have increasingly sought alternative sources.
The leaders are also expected to discuss global economic headwinds and strains on multilateral trade systems after both countries were hit by US tariffs in 2025.
Brazil is India's largest trading partner in Latin America.
Major exports to India include sugar, crude oil, vegetable oils, cotton and iron ore, the latter driven by India's rapid infrastructure growth.
Lula addressed the AI Impact summit in Delhi on Thursday and will later travel to South Korea for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung.

Zampa defends Australia's T20 prep after 'hollow' World Cup exit

Adam Zampa says there is no truth to claims that Australia does not care about T20 cricket.
Zampa described the emotions in the Australian camp as "pretty hollow" after exiting the World Cup at the group stage.
The 33-year-old said Australia had underperformed at each of the three T20 World Cups since winning the tournament in 2021.
Adam Zampa says suggestions Australia and its players do not care about T20 cricket are "totally false" after a disappointing World Cup campaign.
The 33-year-old admitted to feeling "hollow" and not yet wanting to board the plane home after Mitch Marsh's side got knocked out in the prelims of a World Cup for the first time in 17 years.
While being disappointed at the result, Zampa does not believe the performance is an indicator of the squad's care-factor for the shortest format of the game.
"The coaches and the staff probably put as much time into that [T20 cricket] than they would into Test cricket — potentially even more," he said.
"I'm particularly disappointed. I'm not ready to fly home tomorrow, that's for sure.
"You'd prefer to have the wickets than not, but it's probably the worst feeling after getting four wickets that I've ever had.
"I reckon I'd probably be feeling exactly the same if I got none-for tonight. Yeah, feeling pretty hollow, to be honest."
"After what we've built as a group over the last two years, the way we've played some really good bilateral cricket, to be sitting here right now, knowing I'm flying home tomorrow, I didn't envision this, that's for sure. So it's a flat feeling," he said.
Zampa said Australia's players had not spoken much about the disappointing tournament, though he expected a full review after they returned home.
He was particularly harsh on himself about the Sri Lanka loss during which he was hit for 41 off four wicketless overs as the co-hosts coasted home by eight wickets at Pallekele.
"Looking back, I think I could have done more in that Sri Lanka game. My contribution to that game was not where I wanted it to be and I'm not happy with it," he said.
"It's definitely my job to seal wickets through the middle, and I was able to do that in a couple of games, and not in some others.
"We built something over the last couple of years, and we've all got to play our roles in big games, and, unfortunately, we couldn't get it done when it mattered.
"We're a good team, but then results like this… it's just hard to fathom."
Zampa said Australia had under-performed at the last two T20 World Cups since winning the tournament in 2021.
"I guess we're renowned for being a good tournament team, but since we won in 2021, really disappointing results in 2022 and 2024. Those two teams probably should have given it a nudge and got close to winning it," he said.

Disgraced Andrew’s secret deals with Epstein pose a grim test for the King

Disgraced Andrew’s secret deals with Epstein pose a grim test for the King
London: An email to Jeffrey Epstein in October 2011 told the paedophile and financier that Prince Andrew was about to fly to China to visit three cities as well as Hong Kong.
“Most meetings by now are organised by me,” wrote David Stern, a secretive businessman who was joining the trip. “I stay in the background/hidden, just make the arrangements.”
That email, made public thanks to the US Congress and Department of Justice, is just one of thousands that shed light on the shadowy dealmaking surrounding Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, then known as Prince Andrew and the Duke of York.
It also highlights the challenge for police in piecing together a mosaic from the files in the hope of proving that the former prince engaged in misconduct.
Weeks after the release of the latest files, new facts are still being discovered in the emails between Epstein and his network of political and business insiders. But a lot of this is emerging years too late. It will require an enormous effort, including full assistance from Buckingham Palace, to assemble a case that stands up in court.
Stern was one of Epstein’s closest business associates. He was also a top aide to the former prince. So he remained the middleman between the two long after the prince, as he was at the time, claimed to have cut off contact with the sex offender.
Stern called Epstein “boss” in their emails and was assigned to help Sarah Ferguson, then the Duchess of York, try to avoid bankruptcy. He was also part of the Pitch@Palace scheme that Mountbatten-Windsor set up to connect investors with young companies.
“I am always on your team!!” Stern told Epstein in 2016. He was on the duke’s team too. That same year, he joined the board of the St George’s House Trust, a charity linked to the royal family. He gained incredible access for a man who seemed to come from nowhere.
In one message to Epstein, he could send happy snaps with Andrew and Sarah. In the next, he sent a raunchy photograph of a young woman with champagne.
We are learning more about Stern thanks to an investigation by The Times into his past and an investigation by The Daily Telegraph of London into his deals in China. The full picture is yet to emerge, but Stern was chasing deals with companies such as Evergrande, the Chinese property company that collapsed under billions of dollars in debt.
In the latest discovery in the files, the London Telegraph reports on a proposed deal sent from Stern to Epstein in 2013 to help Mountbatten-Windsor set up a £1 million company to share commissions for funds management work. It did not go ahead.
The investigation is made more difficult by the way so many shielded the former prince for so long. The British media sought to find out more about what Andrew was doing as trade envoy, for instance, but were usually blocked. UK government files are littered with rejected freedom-of-information requests. At times, officials in the Foreign Office or trade agency refused to confirm or deny they had any documents to be released.
Buckingham Palace protected Queen Elizabeth’s favourite son too. The Epstein files include references to young women gaining access to the palace, or Epstein inviting his contacts to royal dinners, but the royal family has kept tight control of any information about what went on.
This protected Mountbatten-Windsor when he was trade envoy from October 2001 to July 2011, and it continued when he ran the non-government Pitch@Palace network for many years afterwards, seeking deals around the world.
Political leaders did not want to confront awkward questions. Early in 2011, when there were serious revelations about Mountbatten-Windsor and his ties to Epstein, the reflexive response from the government was to back him as trade envoy. “I, for one, believe that the Duke of York does an excellent job,” said one minister, Ed Davey, in parliament. Now, as leader of the Liberal Democrats, he demands answers about the former prince.
There was a shameful inertia among those in charge. It took months for Mountbatten-Windsor to step down from the trade post after the scandal first hit. Later, in 2019, he grudgingly stepped back from public duties after more revelations and a disastrous BBC interview. Then, last October, he volunteered to give up his titles.
Finally, the palace realised it had to take a tougher line. Two weeks after that voluntary move, King Charles III removed his titles and honours.
The sluggish response now has a cost. Documents from the trade envoy years have probably been lost, and emails have been wiped. The police will have a tougher job because of the inaction when genuine concerns were aired.
Former cabinet minister Peter Mandelson is under even more scrutiny for endorsing the prince for the trade post in 2001. One Epstein contact helped another.
The King was clearly reluctant last year to be firm with his younger brother, and this may be understandable given what a rupture this has been for the royal family. Now, however, the King promises “full and wholehearted support and co-operation” for the police inquiry, and he will be judged by that pledge.
“The law must take its course,” he said on Thursday. The palace must prove the King means what he says. It should ensure police access to visitor records, files, emails, diaries, notes from foreign trips and any other documents that shed light on Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct in public office.
Mountbatten-Windsor has not been charged. It is too soon to think he will ever be charged, simply because of the challenge of assembling evidence to prevail in court. But it is about time there was a thorough investigation – and the palace will have to help.

South Korea considers joining NATO's PURL initiative – media
The Korea Times stated this citing diplomatic sources, Ukrinform reports.
If South Korea decides to participate, it could deepen its defense ties with Europe, while Seoul seeks to expand arms sales to NATO countries.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea stated that the country is "in continued discussions with NATO on various ways to support Ukraine."
An official confirmed that NATO has requested South Korea to join the PURL mechanism for supporting Ukraine. He added that Seoul's approach to aid the war-affected country focuses on "humanitarian aid and other nonlethal military equipment."
Ukraine's embassy in South Korea did not comment when contacted by The Korea Times.
South Korea, which has become one of the major arms exporters in recent years, is seeking to expand its presence in Europe.
In November of last year, it lost a bid to supply submarines to Poland – one of South Korea's largest arms buyers – in a deal worth about KRW 8 trillion ($6 billion).
Currently, South Korea is competing with Germany for Canada's next-generation submarine project, valued at approximately KRW 60 trillion ($41 billion).
On February 10, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol held a phone call with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at Rutte's request, discussing expanded defense cooperation.
Foreign Minister Cho Hyun also met with NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Sekerinska in Brussels on January 24. They agreed to continue joint efforts in areas including defense.
As previously reported, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that this year contributions to PURL have already reached $584 million, while the total need for PURL in 2026 is $15 billion.

Art deco apartment with train line views sells for $789,000

By Robyn Willis
A Glebe terrace nicknamed the “gingerbread house” by one auction attendee went under the hammer for $2.78 million on Saturday.
Bidding for the single-front terrace at 38 Bellevue Street, Glebe opened at $2.4 million after auctioneer Emma Brown-Garrett rejected the first bid of $2.3 million. The price guide for the property was $2.4 million and the reserve was $2.6 million.
There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
Two potential buyers slogged it out in the heat, with initial bids of $25,000 slowing to increments of $1000, $2000 and $3000. A final $3000 bid brought the hammer down.
The property was one of 1283 scheduled to go to auction in Sydney this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 66.5 per cent from 810 reported results throughout the week, while 178 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
The Glebe home last sold in 2000 for $650,000. It is in an elevated position on a quiet street, within walking distance of Wentworth Park and the new Sydney Fish Market.
The renovated property has four bedrooms and two bathrooms – plus a loo under the stairs – set over three levels, with coveted rear-lane access.
Ray White Touma Taylor agent Walter Burfitt-Williams commended the successful bidders, who planned to keep the property as an investment, and the underbidders, who had driven from Canberra to participate.
“These people are very canny. This is a really good piece of property. If it were in Darlinghurst or Redfern, you could add another million dollars to the price,” he said.
Brown-Garrett said that while there were fewer registered bidders at this time of year, they were motivated to buy.
“We are not seeing overly high registration numbers but get a couple of people, and you create competition. That’s all it takes.”
In Gordon, a two-storey renovated 1920s bungalow sold for $3,998,000. The property had a price guide of $3.6 million and a reserve of $3.85 million. There were four registered bidders, with three active.
The four-bedroom house at 34 Highlands Avenue, Gordon is set on a 1005-square-metre site and is fully renovated, with multiple living areas, formal dining and a pool.
It sold to a local family looking to upgrade. LJ Hooker Gordon agent Jing Peng said the underbidders had grown up in Gordon and were seeking to move back.
“It’s close to everything,” she said.
“Gordon is still very popular with people who love the north shore lifestyle, and with the market this year and the interest rates, people are looking for value.”
Closer to the city, a first home buyer was the successful bidder for a 65-square-metre apartment in an art deco building in Woolloomooloo, purchasing the property for $789,000.
The east-facing apartment at 8/150 Forbes Street, Woolloomooloo is in a building constructed in 1937 and designed by architects Brewster and Manderson.
It was conceived with the streamlined features of an ocean liner and was originally used as a vehicle showroom and offices before being converted into apartments in the 1980s.
The one-bedroom apartment with a view of the train lines includes a mezzanine-style loft bedroom with storage, high ceilings and an open-plan kitchen and living area.
Bidding for the property, which had a price guide of $725,000 to $750,000, opened at $700,000 with three active bidders placing increments of $5000. The reserve was set at $750,000.
The underbidders planned to place the property in a trust.
Agent Nuri Shik of BresicWhitney East said that at this end of the market, buyers were motivated by rental costs.
“They’re really wanting to buy because rents are so expensive,” Shik said.
On the south side of the city, a five-bedroom, three-bathroom house at 36 Budyan Road, Grays Point sold for $2,825,000 to a family from nearby Gymea looking to upgrade while still being near their children’s schools.
The property’s price guide was $2.5 million to $2.6 million. The initial reserve of $2.7 million was reduced during the auction to $2,660,000 as four active bidders competed. Bidding opened at $2.2 million and stalled at $2.5 million before picking up again.
Agent Ben Jensen of Alex Pitsis Group said the underbidders were a local couple who wanted to buy the fully renovated home, rather than renovate their own property.
Jensen said part of the appeal of the property was its proximity to bike trails and a nearby boat ramp for the Georges River.
“Grays Point is great if you love outdoor activities,” he said. “It’s an old-school Australiana community where kids can ride their bikes to the shops.
“If you have a floor plan like that, it opens the market to different clients – downsizers and families with young kids and older kids.“

Why Trump’s tariff defeat has sparked fears of an interest rate spike
In the seconds after the US Supreme Court ruled against Donald Trump’s tariff war on his own people, financial markets did one thing – bet that American interest rates would go higher.
Despite the political brouhaha around Trump and his more-than-colourful criticisms of the Supreme Court’s decision, the president’s tariff policy is a deadly serious economic story.
So much has transpired in the 12 months of the Trump presidency that it can be difficult to remember it all. But if you cast your mind back to April, and “Liberation Day”, you’ll recall the turmoil Trump’s tariff announcements caused.
Not only were the penguins and seals of Heard and McDonald islands targeted for tariffs, share markets collapsed, the Australian dollar sank like a stone and the Reserve Bank considered a half percentage point interest rate cut.
The world recovered as Trump walked back his actions (but not his rhetoric).
But there was always a strong suspicion that it could come undone if the Supreme Court backed the arguments of tens of thousands of businesses (and several states) that the tariffs were unconstitutional.
That’s where we find ourselves now.
The removal of tariffs, which have collected about $US176 billion ($249 billion) since their introduction, should be good for the American economy. No matter what Trump says, that $US176 billion was a dead weight on consumers and businesses.
Interest rates went up for two reasons. One was the expectation that the removal of tariffs could act like a fiscal stimulus to an economy already struggling with inflationary pressures.
They also went up for what the end of the tariffs mean for the US budget deficit.
Trump has consistently argued that the tariffs will repair a budget that by any measure is a disaster. Through 2025, tariff revenue surged from $US98 billion to almost $US290 billion.
Despite that increase, the budget remains deep in the red, with a cumulative deficit so far this American financial year of $US700 billion. Government debt is north of $US38 trillion, with the interest bill alone more than $US1.5 trillion.
Remove tariff revenue and the budget gets worse. The administration was expecting to collect $US3.6 trillion in tariff revenue between this year and 2035. The court’s decision reduces that to $US2.3 trillion.
In anyone’s money, a $US1.3 trillion shortfall is a problem. It means that the Trump presidency has to start selling more bonds to cover that debt.
More bonds usually mean higher interest rates to encourage investors to give their cash to Uncle Sam. And those higher interest rates increase the interest bill paid by American taxpayers.
Trump immediately said he would reimpose tariffs. He has a right to impose one tariff rate across all countries for six months before having to get congressional approval.
Congress has shown a growing unwillingness to back tariffs. In six months’ time, most members of Congress will be in the heat of their re-election campaigns and the thought of supporting a price hike on voters would surely make most baulk at supporting Trump.
Then there is the network of trade deals, with their varying levels of tariff rates, that were hammered out after “Liberation Day”.
While the wildlife of Heard and McDonald islands are likely to be spared another round of trade talks, the confusion of coming months will weigh on the economy.
As Oxford Economics lead US economist Bernard Yaros noted, the uncertainty of months of tariff discussion would affect businesses, investors and households. “This uncertainty is a key downside risk that could ding, rather than derail, growth this year,” he said.
The court’s decision followed less-than-stellar pieces of economic data over recent days.
America’s trade deficit, which Trump’s tariffs were supposed to erase, reached $US901 billion through 2025. It was almost exactly the same as 2024, and is one of the largest on record.
Inflation data showed core price growth at 2.5 per cent, partly because of the tariffs imposed by Trump. The Federal Reserve, as far from hitting its inflation target as the Reserve Bank is from hitting its own, is not about to embark on a round of rate cuts, even with Trump ally Kevin Warsh as its new head.
And late this week, GDP data showed American economic growth slowing through the final months of 2025. This was caused by both the US government shutdown plus a slowdown in consumer spending that was partly caused by Trump’s tariffs.
Trump’s tariffs remain the biggest economic own goal since British voters backed Brexit. The UK economy has never recovered from that decision.
The Supreme Court has given Trump a chance to reverse his own economic policy folly.

US military strike kills three in second alleged drug boat attack this week

The US military launched a strike on an alleged drug smuggling boat in the eastern Pacific on Friday, killing three men in its second strike this week.
“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” US Southern Command, which oversees operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, said on Twitter/X.
No US military forces were harmed, according to Southern Command, which is now led by Gen Francis Donovan.
Friday’s strike brought the total number of people killed in US strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats since September to at least 148. Earlier this week, another US military strike killed 11 people, making it one of the deadliest attacks this year.
A 16-second clip posted by the Southern Command on Friday shows a single strike being launched at the boat, which later burst into flames.
The strike is part of the Trump administration’s buildup of US forces in the region to allegedly intercept drug traffickers.
Just how legal these strikes are has been of rising concern for lawmakers and legal experts, with some arguing that the Pentagon is carrying out extrajudicial killings and exerting “abuse of power with life-or-death consequences”.
“Under both U.S. and international law, it is flagrantly illegal to use the military to kill civilians suspected only of crimes,” reads a December statement by Jeffrey Stein, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and Christopher Anders, director of the Democracy and Technology Division at ACLU. “Civilians, including those suspected of smuggling drugs, are not lawful targets. Just because the Trump administration says these strikes are firmly grounded in law doesn’t make it true.”
Donovan took over the US Southern Command after Adm Alvin Holsey abruptly retired, reportedly over disagreements about the strike policy.

Man charged with murder after woman struck by car in Reservoir

‘She did not deserve this’: Mother allegedly murdered by neighbour outside her home
On Saturday, a woman had to tell her niece the unimaginable: your mother was allegedly murdered, struck by a car outside her home in Melbourne’s northern suburbs.
The family of Melonie McKay, 53, were devastated by her death on Saturday, after the mother and grandmother was fatally hit on Seston Street in Reservoir about 7.40pm on Friday, where authorities declared her dead.
Her neighbour Luke Rainey, 44, was later charged with her murder.
McKay’s sister was tasked with telling one of her nieces, who struggles with severe mental illness and lived with her mother.
McKay was the epitome of kindness and compassion, always putting her loved ones first, her sister told The Age. Her warmth and love touched everyone she met, she said.
“The loss of her life to violence has been absolutely devastating, not just to us, but especially to her three children,” said McKay’s sister, who asked not to be named to protect her privacy.
“Our family will forever feel the void she’s left behind, and the pain of this loss is unimaginable.”
McKay lived without judgment, and her resilience when confronted with adversity inspired the people around her, her sister said.
McKay’s son, Trent Ottrey, learnt about Friday’s incident on social media and arrived at his mother’s home about two hours after it happened. On Saturday, he spoke to reporters outside the home with tears in his eyes.
McKay’s sister said the 53-year-old was struck outside her front door. Bouquets of flowers were left on her doorstep on Saturday.
“My mum grew up hard, so we grew up hard. We went through a bit,” Ottrey said.
“Half of the people I knew from around the area knew about it before I even knew about it.”
His mother struggled with mental illness and addiction, and Ottrey said he had a complicated relationship with her.
Ottrey said the family knew of Rainey.
McKay’s cousin, Carly McKay, paid tribute to the 53-year-old via a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for her funeral. “My cousin was the most caring and beautiful person who did not deserve to [lose] her life,” Carly wrote.
Rainey faced Melbourne Magistrates’ Court on Saturday, where he told the court he had two children, for whom he had full custody.
Appearing via video link, Rainey wore a dark green shirt and sat with his hands resting on his knees.
His lawyer told the court Rainey had no significant mental health concerns, but it would be prudent for his client to be linked with a custody nurse because of the length of time before a further hearing.
The lawyer said there was a large amount of evidence from the scene that needed to be processed by forensics, which would delay when the police’s hand-up brief of evidence could be submitted to the court.
“This is the highest offence that one can face … There is quite a lot of reconstruction by forensics to be done,” he said.
Rainey is unable to seek bail because of the nature of the charge and will return to court on July 1.
Forensic investigators could be seen behind police tape looking inside a white ute that was stopped on the road on Friday night, Nine News reported.

MONTREAL – OpenAI flagged and banned the suspect in one of Canada’s worst-ever mass shootings
The artificial intelligence company said that the suspected killer – Jesse Van Rootselaar
The Canadian police alleged that the 18-year-old killed eight people and injured about 25, before taking her own life in the remote western Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge earlier in February.
OpenAI identified an account associated with Van Rootselaar about eight months ago, with tools to detect misuse of its AI models to further violent activities, and banned it, the company said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported OpenAI’s identification of Van Rootselaar, citing anonymous sources as saying that the alleged killer “described scenarios involving gun violence over the course of several days”, which triggered an internal debate among roughly a dozen staffers, some of whom urged leaders to alert the police, the report said.
OpenAI said it considered referring the account to law enforcement at the time, but did not identify credible or imminent planning and determined it did not meet the threshold. After the shooting, the company contacted the Canadian authorities.
“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy,” an OpenAI spokesperson said by e-mail. “We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation.”
The company said it trains ChatGPT to discourage imminent real-world harm. BLOOMBERG

Brazil, India eye critical minerals deal as leaders meet
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW DELHI - India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were holding talks in New Delhi on Feb 21, seeking to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of these elements, which are used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smartphones to jet engines and guided missiles.
India, seeking to cut its dependence on top exporter China,
Mr Lula, heading a delegation of more than a dozen ministers as well as business leaders, arrived in New Delhi on Feb 18 for a global summit.
On Feb 21, he was given a ceremonial welcome and paid his tributes to India’s independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, before going into the meeting with Mr Modi.
Officials have said the two leaders are expected to sign a memorandum on critical minerals and discuss efforts to increase trade links.
The world’s most populous nation is already the 10th largest market for Brazilian exports, with bilateral trade topping US$15 billion (S$19 billion) in 2025.
The two countries have set a trade target of US$20 billion to be achieved by 2030.
With China holding a near-monopoly on rare earths production, some countries are seeking alternative sources.
Mr Rishabh Jain, an expert with the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank, said India’s growing cooperation with Brazil on critical minerals complements recent supply chain engagements with the United States, France and the European Union.
While these partnerships grant India access to advanced technologies, finance and high-end processing capabilities, “Global South alliances are critical for securing diversified, on-ground resource access and shaping emerging rules of global trade”, Mr Jain told AFP.
‘New momentum’
Mr Modi and Mr Lula are also expected to discuss global economic headwinds and strains on multilateral trade systems after both of their countries were hit by US tariffs in 2025, prompting the two leaders to call for stronger cooperation.
Washington has since pledged to roll back duties on Indian goods under a trade deal announced earlier in February.
“Lula and Modi will have the opportunity to exchange views on... the challenges to multilateralism and international trade,” said Brazilian diplomat Susan Kleebank, the secretary for Asia and the Pacific.
Brazil is India’s biggest partner in Latin America.
Key Brazilian exports to India include sugar, crude oil, vegetable oils, cotton and iron ore.
Demand for iron ore has been driven by rapid infrastructure expansion and industrial growth in India, which is on track to become the world’s fourth largest economy.
India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he was confident that Mr Lula’s talks with Mr Modi “will impart a new momentum to our ties”.
“Deeply appreciate his warm sentiments and guidance on advancing our strategic partnership,” he said in a post on X on Feb 21.
Brazilian firms are also expanding in the country, with Embraer and Adani Group announcing plans in January to build aircraft in India.
Mr Lula addressed the AI Impact summit in Delhi on Feb 19, calling for a multilateral and inclusive global governance framework for artificial intelligence.
He will travel on to South Korea for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum. AFP

US military kills 3 in latest strike on ‘narcoterrorist’ boat
The latest lethal strike pushes the overall death toll from the Trump administration’s deadly campaign to at least 148 across 43 attacks
The US military has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
US Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations”. It said the strike on Friday killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat floating in the water before bursting into flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to at least 148 people in at least 43 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
The boat strikes has also drawn intense criticism following the revelation that the military killed survivors of the very first boat attack with a follow-up strike.
The Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers said it was legal and necessary, while Democratic lawmakers and legal experts said the killings were murder, if not a war crime.

Nearly 50 Years After the ‘Miracle on Ice,’ Team USA Is Striving for Olympic History
Unknown

By any objective measure, Columbus Blue Jackets defensemen Zach Werenski has realized his dreams. A Gross Point, Mich., native who played his college hockey at the University of Michigan and is a 10-year veteran of the NHL, Werenski is one of many success stories populating the major American sports scene. In 2021, he signed a six-year, $57.5 million contract extension with the Blue Jackets, which made him one of the highest-paid defensemen in all of pro hockey. What’s more, he got married last summer, and he and his wife, Odette, are expecting their first child in a few months.
Given all that, Werenski has a packed schedule, especially during the NHL season, and has plenty of ways to occupy his scant free time. But none of this stopped him from catching the new Netflix documentary Miracle: The Boys of ‘80, which came out in late January, before Werenski flew with his American teammates to represent the United States in the Olympic hockey tournament in Italy. Werenski says he prefers this nonfiction fare to Miracle, the popular 2004 Disney movie based on the same real-life fairy tale of the legendary 1980 American Olympic hockey team that defeated the Soviet Union in Lake Placid, N.Y., en route to an underdog gold medal.
Werenski is well aware that no American men’s hockey team has won gold since the “Miracle on Ice” 46 years ago. So he felt a need to further soak up accounts of that storied victory, in order to help America write a new chapter of Olympic hockey history. “It definitely motivated me a little more,” says Werenski. “We’re aware of what’s at stake.”
The tournament at the 2026 Games has been the first one in a dozen years to feature NHL players, making it a best-on-best tournament on par with Olympic basketball, or World Cup soccer. With a dominant 6-2 victory over Slovakia in the Olympic semifinal in Milan, the American team has officially clinched a spot on the podium—and a shot at that historic gold.

As the American men’s hockey players filed off the ice following their semifinal win on Friday, there was little incentive for them to break down, in any detail, what wound up being a routine victory. No, all minds were already turned to Sunday, when the U.S. will face Canada in an all-North American, border war Olympic final, and a rematch of the 4 Nations Face-Off final from a year ago, when an overtime goal from Canadian star Connor McDavid broke American hearts. The United States had earlier defeated Canada, 3-1, in Montreal, in round robin play.
The matchup that everyone seemed to desire going into this tournament is actually happening. It’ll close up Olympic competition at these Milano Cortina Games, and if history is any kind of predictor of future events, it could be an epic end to a successful Olympics.
The prospect of winning the first American men's hockey gold medal on foreign soil—Team USA also finished first at the 1960 Olympics, in Squaw Valley, Calif.—has millionaire pros harkening back to more innocent days. “It’s going to be a real special moment to just have an opportunity to achieve your childhood dream,” says American Brady Tkachuk, who plays for the Ottawa Senators. “There’s nothing better than that.”
Both teams are familiar with each other from last year’s event, and the players also know one another’s tendencies from their NHL experience. The last time these two squads met in the Olympic final was in 2010, in Vancouver, when Canada needed a Sidney Crosby overtime goal to lift the host nation to an unforgettable victory. That game was the most-watched broadcast in Canadian television history. Canada also won the last Olympic tournament to feature best-on-best hockey, in 2014 in Sochi, and—thanks to that McDavid heartbreaker—are the defending 4 Nations Face-Off champs. Expectations are high in a country for which hockey is a national pastime, passion, and obsession rolled into one.

The U.S. might do well to just enjoy the moment. “I'm just going to do the same thing that we usually do,” says Tkachuk. “Eat pasta, hang out, just relax. If you overthink it, you're just going to miss the fun.”
But this isn’t 1980. The United States isn’t sending out a collection of college kids against the Red Army. An American victory wouldn’t shock the universe like it did nearly a half century ago.
It would, however, harken back to a special time, when in one area of endeavor, at least, the country embodied an underdog spirit. The whole country felt it. Can the U.S. capture that again?
We’ll find out soon enough: Sunday, at 2:10 p.m. Milan time. “Chills,” says U.S. forward Dylan Larkin, when asked what he’s feeling while envisioning what could be ahead. “Maybe we wouldn't even realize the impact it would have. The way this tournament has gone, and how everyone has seemed to want the U.S.-Canada final, hopefully it's really building some tension. And people are as excited about Sunday as we are.”

When Andrew got a princely lesson in the law in Australia

When Andrew got a princely lesson in the law in Australia
We can’t be entirely sure of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s reaction at discovering the size 12 boots of the law clomping around on the doorstep of his latest digs in the outer darkness of Sandringham Estate, Norfolk.
But we can take a wild and somewhat informed guess.
The then Prince Andrew, Duke of York, offered an insight into his royal snootiness at Melbourne Airport more than 20 years ago.
The moment revealed he was not keen to accede to the rules required of the rest of us commoners. Not keen at all.
Having indulged in what was considered a “private” visit to Melbourne – and these years later, we are intrigued to imagine what a private visit might have involved in relation to a fellow like Andy – he was collared by security as he was about to board a Qantas jet at Tullamarine, bound for New Zealand.
“Excuse I, your Magnificence,” said the security officer, or words approximately to that effect, which we have made up for effect.
“We’ll be needing to give you a bit of a quick security screening. Won’t take a sec.”
The prince reared back as if someone had accused him of being a member of the low-born classes who would allow just anyone to inspect his personage, or possibly something even worse.
He flat refused, according to a report in this masthead on October 2, 2005.
“Prince Andrew was prevented from boarding a Qantas jet to New Zealand last Wednesday after refusing to be screened by security guards at Melbourne Airport,” this masthead reported.
“After a tense stand-off, the Duke of York reluctantly agreed to be searched with a hand-held detector. The search took 10 seconds, and he was found to be clear.”
It wasn’t that he was being given the fifth degree in any old crowded security queue, either.
He was at a “special gate”, as might have befitted a prince who hadn’t yet caused the world to be transfixed by, for instance, a TV interview where he declared he couldn’t actually sweat, among other peculiar matters relating, for further instance, to a former pal named Jeffrey Epstein.
The Tullamarine security guards, bless them, weren’t about to be mucked around by Andrew even if he were the Queen’s favourite son.
“Managers and security were called, and it was suggested to the prince that he sit down in the next room and think about it for a while,” a source said at the time.
“He was told he would not be allowed to board the flight unless he agreed to be screened because it was the law. Eventually, he reluctantly agreed.”
Two decades later, common Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been reminded again that the law still applies to him.
Perhaps he’s a slow learner.

Isaiah Zagar, renowned Jewish mosaic artist who created Philadelphia’s Magic Gardens, dies at 86

Isaiah Zagar, the famed Jewish mosaic artist whose shimmering, kaleidoscopic installations transformed streets and buildings across Philadelphia and founded the city’s Magic Gardens, died on Thursday at the age of 86.
Zagar died on Thursday of complications from heart failure and Parkinson’s disease at his home in Philadelphia.
“The scale of Isaiah Zagar’s body of work and his relentless artmaking at all costs is truly astounding,” Emily Smith, the executive director of the Magic Gardens, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. “Most people do not yet understand the importance of what he created, nor do they understand the sheer volume of what he has made.”
Born Irwin Zagar in Philadelphia in 1939, Zagar grew up in Brooklyn, New York, where he received his bachelor’s in painting and graphics at the Pratt Institute of Art. “When you’re a Jew growing up in Brooklyn, they don’t name you Isaiah,” he told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 1980. “They name you Ira, or Irving, or Irwin.”
In 1959, when Zagar was 19, he received a summer art scholarship to go to Woodstock, New York, where he encountered the works of famed “outside artist” Clarence Schmidt, who would later become his mentor. During that summer, he also studied Jewish religious texts, which later inspired him to change his first name to Isaiah, according to the Daily Mail.
In 1963, Zagar met artist Julia Zagar, and the pair were married three months later and joined the Peace Corps as conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War.
Isaiah Zagar's early career
Zagar and his wife moved to South Philadelphia in 1968, where she opened the Eye’s Gallery on South Street, and he created his first art installation by embellishing the building’s facade.
Over the following decades, Zagar used broken tiles, mirrors, and bottles to adorn roughly 50,000 square feet of walls and buildings across Philadelphia with his iconic mosaic art. In the late 1990s, he transformed two empty lots near his South Philadelphia home into an immersive mosaic and sculpture installation that would later become the iconic Magic Gardens.
Zagar’s works are featured in the permanent collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. More than 200 of his mosaic pieces can also be found across several states, as well as in Mexico and Chile.
In 2008, Zagar’s son, the filmmaker Jeremiah Zagar, released the documentary “In a Dream,” an intimate portrait of his father’s struggles with mental health and drive to build the Magic Gardens. He worked with a producer he met in Hebrew class at the Jewish day school, now known as Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy, according to a 2022 profile in the Philadelphia Jewish Exponent.
“Isaiah was more than our founder; he was our close friend, teacher, collaborator, and creative inspiration,” wrote the Magic Gardens in a post on Facebook. “He was unlike anyone we have ever met and will ever meet. Above all things, he was an artist. In his lifetime, he created a body of work that is unique and remarkable, and one that has left an everlasting mark on our city.”
Zagar is survived by his wife and two sons, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

ChatGPT-maker OpenAI considered alerting Canadian police about school shooting suspect months ago

OpenAI employees raised alarm about mass shooting suspect months ago: report
Jesse Van Rootselaar’s ChatGPT account was flagged for ‘furtherance of violent activities’
- Bookmark
OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said Friday it considered alerting Canadian police in 2025 about the online activities of the suspect in one of the worst school shootings in the country’s history.
The San Francisco tech company said it identified the account of Jesse Van Rootselaar in June via abuse detection efforts for “furtherance of violent activities.”
It considered whether to refer the teenager’s account to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, but ruled that it did not meet the threshold for referal to law enforcement.
Instead, it banned the account for violating its usage policy.
Van Rootselaar, 18, is suspected of killing eight people in a remote part of British Columbia last week, before killing herself.
OpenAI said the threshold for referring a user to law enforcement is whether the case involves an imminent and credible risk of serious physical harm to others. The company said it did not identify credible or imminent planning.
OpenAI’s revelation was originally reported by The Wall Street Journal.
OpenAI said that, after learning of the school shooting, employees reached out to the RCMP with information on the suspect and her use of ChatGPT.
“Our thoughts are with everyone affected by the Tumbler Ridge tragedy. We proactively reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with information on the individual and their use of ChatGPT, and we’ll continue to support their investigation,” an OpenAI spokesperson said.
The RCMP said Van Rootselaar first killed her mother and stepbrother at the family home before attacking the nearby school. Van Rootselaar had a history of mental health contacts with police.
The motive for the shooting remains unclear.
The town of 2,700 people in the Canadian Rockies is more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) northeast of Vancouver, near the provincial border with Alberta. Police said the victims included a 39-year-old teaching assistant and five students, ages 12 to 13.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest rampage since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.

Tariffs on Singapore expected to stay unchanged even as Trump imposes new 10% global levies

HOUSTON – Goods from Singapore will face a tariff of 10 per cent, even after the US Supreme Court threw out President Donald Trump’s signature reciprocal tariffs policy
The apex court ruled in a 6-3 decision on Feb 20 that the US President does not have the power to unilaterally impose tariffs
But Mr Trump moved to impose a new 10 per cent global tariff
Just hours after the landmark ruling, he appeared at a press conference at the White House to criticise the development as “deeply disappointing”.
“I am ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what is right for our country. Foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years are ecstatic, and dancing in the streets. But they won’t be dancing for long!” he said.
The justices were “fools and lapdogs” as well as “unpatriotic and disloyal”, he said.
“It is my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests, and a political movement that is far smaller than people would think. But obnoxious, ignorant and loud!”
Mr Trump did not name the “foreign interests” when asked but added: “They have a lot of influence over the Supreme Court, whether it’s through fear or respect or friendships.”
Though disparaging of the court decision, he did not appear shaken by the ruling, which threatens to upend the centrepiece of the trade policy of his second term. He said it would only force him to take a longer route to achieve the same end.
“It is my great honour to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a global 10 per cent tariff on all countries, which will be effective almost immediately,” he said in a subsequent Truth Social post.
The new tariff is being imposed under Section 122 (Trade Act of 1974) which permits temporary import surcharges or quotas to address serious trade deficits. It is a stopgap measure while longer investigations are conducted. The tariffs can be no higher than 15 per cent and last only for 150 days.
Under IEEPA, a baseline tariff of 10 per cent was charged on goods from Singapore – a US free trade partner since 2004 – under the so-called “Liberation Day” reciprocal tariffs announced by Mr Trump in April 2025.
“Given that Singapore is already subjected to a 10 per cent tariff, things should remain stable,” veteran US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler, who is senior vice-president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told The Straits Times.
Aside from the baseline tariffs on Singapore goods, different tariffs apply to certain sectors, like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.
About 75 per cent of Singapore’s semiconductor exports enter the US duty-free or at reduced rates due to exemptions
Singapore-based pharma companies are subject to a 100 per cent tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical products unless the company is building a manufacturing facility in the US.
But implementation of the tariff has been delayed.
Mr Trump said he had “great alternatives” to the IEEPA tariffs.
He named Section 301 (Trade Act of 1974), under which US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer can investigate and remedy unfair trade practices, including through tariffs. These actions are country-specific and do not offer universal coverage.
Mr Trump also mentioned Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which allows the President to impose tariffs on imports that threaten national security, after an investigation by the Department of Commerce.
None of these provisions – which entail a slow process to find trade distortions by trade partners – allow for the sweeping, universal tariffs that Mr Trump had imposed under IEEPA.
They will force the US trade policy to be more rule-bound and less idiosyncratic.
Ripples will be felt in South-east Asia, which saw some of the highest reciprocal tariff rates – between 46 per cent and 49 per cent – announced in April 2025.
Some of these were subsequently lowered through negotiated trade deals
Businesses will need clarity quickly, given that the court ruling adds uncertainty and confusion to an already complicated trade landscape, said Mr Brian McFeeters, president and chief executive officer of the US-ASEAN Business Council.
“But this is not a deal-breaker for the US-ASEAN economic ties,” he said, describing South-east Asian leaders as deeply pragmatic players who recognise the scale of the US market and the quality and staying power of US investments.
“There may be some disruption or slower movement on the margins but the broader trajectory – including progress on agreements on reciprocal trade focused on tackling non-tariff barriers – remains firmly intact,” Mr McFeeters told ST.
Mr Trump had also imposed additional tariffs under IEEPA on China, Canada and Mexico tied to fentanyl trafficking concerns. Likewise, India had faced tariffs of around 50 per cent, which included IEEPA tariffs to penalise its purchase of Russian oil, before these were negotiated down to 25 per cent in February
“Beijing will be delighted to see the Supreme Court invalidate the IEEPA tariffs, which it has condemned as illegitimate and inconsistent with US commitments to the World Trade Organization,” said an analysis from scholars at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). The average rate of US tariffs on China, inclusive of IEEPA tariffs, stands at 47.5 per cent.
Dr Marcus Noland, executive vice-president at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted that the trade deals struck with Japan, South Korea and others were contingent on the threat of the so-called Liberation Day tariffs.
“If those are null and void, then one has to expect that our partner countries will want to vacate the subsequent deals that were, frankly, extortionary,” he said.
The July 2025 trade deal with the European Union
The CSIS analysis said the agreement might collapse and lead to a nullifying of investment commitments of US$600 billion (S$760 billion) by 2029 and purchases of US$750 billion worth of natural gas over three years that the Trump administration has presented as major successes.
Ms Cutler, the trade negotiator, said walking away from the deals announced in recent months does not seem to be on the cards for US partners.
“They know all too well that such a step could end up leaving them in a worse position with the White House,” she said.
Even after the IEEPA tariffs were struck down, US businesses could continue paying the tariffs for days or weeks until they are officially notified about changes in the tariffs. The US is also likely to face demands for massive refunds to importers, which some estimates say could run to about US$175 billion.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his estimates show that the use of Section 122 authority, combined with potentially enhanced Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs, will result in “virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026”.
The tariff ruling appears to be popular; a YouGov survey of 1,931 US adults on Feb 20 found that 60 per cent approved of the Supreme Court striking down Mr Trump’s tariffs.

Border Police thwart illegal Palestinian infiltration attempt near Jerusalem

Border Police on Friday thwarted an attempt by approximately 30 Palestinian West Bank residents to infiltrate Israel through the seam route near the Nebi Samuel area, located just outside Jerusalem.
According to the Israel Police Spokesperson's Office, Border Police initially identified a suspicious vehicle transporting several individuals near the route. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the vehicle's driver, a 60-year-old Jerusalem resident, was assisting the Palestinians. The driver was subsequently detained for questioning by the Jerusalem Border Police's Investigations and Intelligence Division.
Meanwhile, additional suspects were located near the route. An initial field interrogation revealed that the suspects were attempting to attend Ramadan prayers at the Temple Mount.
Police keep worshipers safe during Temple Mount Ramadan prayers
Thousands of police officers and Border Police were deployed across Jerusalem on Friday, the first Friday of Ramadan, to ensure the safe arrival of worshippers at the Temple Mount. Under the command of Jerusalem District Commander Major General Avshalom Peled, the forces were tasked with overseeing security operations throughout the city, particularly at key points such as the Qalandiya crossing.
The coordinated effort aimed to maintain public order, facilitate smooth traffic flow, and ensure the safety of tens of thousands of worshippers attending the noon prayer at the Temple Mount. The prayer proceeded without incident, with extensive security measures in place.
Earlier in the day, a special situation assessment was held at the police point at the Western Wall, attended by Police Commissioner Major General Danny Levy, Major General Avshalom Peled, and other senior police officers. Following this, Minister of National Security MK Itamar Ben-Gvir joined the team for a subsequent situation briefing to finalize security preparations for the day’s events.
Jerusalem Police vow to maintain Temple Mount status quo during Ramadan
Jerusalem Police have deployed hundreds of officers throughout the capital with a focus on the Old City and the Temple Mount to ensure freedom of worship and public order during Ramadan, officials said.
Deputy Commander Arad Braverman said forces will be stationed around the clock at key sites, with larger deployments on Fridays to manage crowds and traffic. Authorities expect the government to approve about 10,000 entry permits for West Bank Palestinians to attend Friday prayers, depending on final decisions.
Police stressed there will be no change to the status quo on the Temple Mount, despite political rhetoric, and noted there will be no magnetometers at the site.
Officials also highlighted heightened monitoring of incitement and efforts to prevent disorder, including online misinformation, saying past attempts to spark unrest have been thwarted. Coordination with the Jerusalem Municipality, Magen David Adom, and the Islamic Waqf is ongoing to manage crowds and traffic safely.
Jerusalem District Commander Avshalom Peled said police are committed to safeguarding freedom of worship for all religions during the holy month.
Israeli activist group decries 'aggressive' Temple Mount policy
An Israeli activist group, Ir Amim, criticized what it called an “aggressive policy on the Temple Mount” ahead of Ramadan, warning that recent changes have undermined the status quo at the site.
The group said hundreds of thousands of Muslim worshippers are expected daily during the holy month and accused authorities of “violations,” such as allowing expanded Jewish prayer and other measures it says restrict Muslim access.
Ir Amim pointed to police data showing that the number of Muslim worshippers on the mount has declined significantly over the past decade, framing this as evidence of “systematic deterrence.”
The organisation urged the police and government to ease limitations on Muslim worshippers, reinstate previous restrictions on Jewish prayer at the compound, and consider closing the site to non‑Muslims during Ramadan’s final ten days.

Illinois Senate candidate Robin Kelly says Israel committed ‘genocide’ in Gaza

An Illinois congresswoman who is running for US Senate said during a debate Thursday night that she believed Israel committed a genocide in Gaza, in the latest sign of a sea change in Democratic sentiment about Israel.
“It may not have started off being like that, but I believe that is what it turned into,” said Rep. Robin Kelly, who is running to replace the retiring Sen. Dick Durbin.
Following the debate, Kelly took to X to hammer the point that neither Lieutenant Gov. Juliana Stratton nor Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi was willing to match her accusation.
“Every candidate on stage tonight had the opportunity to condemn genocide in Gaza,” she wrote. “I’m the only one who did.”
The debate came a month after Scott Wiener, the Jewish politician running to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi in California, drew fire after initially declining to answer a debate question about whether Israel committed genocide in Gaza, then said he had decided it had.
Kelly's shifting opinion on Israel
It also came just a year after Kelly received a donation from AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby - then adopted more critical stances on Israel since declaring her Senate candidacy last May.
The three candidates’ responses to the question about Gaza underscored just how present Israel remains in electoral politics months after a US-brokered ceasefire sent the two-year-old Israel-Hamas war into a new era. During the war, Democratic voters’ approval of Israel plummeted to the single digits, according to some polls, and an array of politicians who had never before been vocal critics of Israel adopted harshly critical stances.
Kelly has traveled to Israel multiple times on congressional delegations and sought to curry support within the Chicago Jewish community in the past. Now, as she carves out a position among the three frontrunners in the Senate race as the one most critical of Israel, her success in the primary could be a measure of how heavily Democratic voters are weighing the issue.
None of the candidates offered a straightforward pro-Israel view on the debate floor. Asked whether she would support Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s resolution to recognize “the genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza,” Stratton said that “the devastation and suffering that we have seen is terrible” and that “we must do everything we can” to provide humanitarian aid to Gazans.
Krishnamoorthi said he is concerned that people are “extremely divided” in determining “what exactly happened.”
“My concern is this: division getting in the way of progress right now in this fragile ceasefire,” he said. “If that gets in the way of progress, then we’re going to go back to war. And we can’t let that happen.”
Kelly added that she had not actually read Tlaib’s resolution. “But as I just said, I think it was genocide,” she said.
Robin Kelly's history in politics
Kelly first took office in 2013. Since announcing her Senate run last year, she has adopted harsher stances on Israel.
In August, she said she would have voted in favor of a pair of Bernie Sanders-led resolutions in the Senate that would block certain arms sales to Israel. And in the House, Kelly cosponsored the Block the Bombs Act that would withhold the transfer of offensive weapons to Israel.
“Israelis and Palestinians must work to secure a path forward where both peoples can live in peace, safety, and security,” Kelly said in a statement at the time regarding Sanders’ resolutions. “I have supported Israel, but in this moment, I cannot in good conscience defend starving young children and prolonging the suffering of innocent families. Now is the time for moral leadership in the US Senate.”
At a candidates’ forum in October, several candidates referred to Israel’s campaign in Gaza as a “genocide,” the Daily Northwestern reported.
Kelly was not among them. But she pledged during the forum that she would not accept funds from AIPAC. That was a new position for Kelly, who accepted contributions from AIPAC’s PAC in March and April 2025, according to FEC filings. She was endorsed by the liberal pro-Israel group J Street in her 2024 reelection campaign.
At the forum, Stratton was the only candidate who recognized the upcoming two-year anniversary of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Stratton and Krishnamoorthi did not swear off AIPAC contributions.
The Democratic primary, set for March 17, is seen as a three-person race among Kelly, Stratton, and Krishnamoorthi. Kelly has garnered endorsements from several politicians, including Sens. Cory Booker and Chris Murphy. Stratton’s endorsements include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, while Krishnamoorthi has been endorsed by Bill Daley, who was Obama’s White House chief of staff, and a number of state and US representatives.
Unlike a handful of House elections in the state, this race has not seen any reported spending by pro-Israel groups, including AIPAC or its super PAC, the United Democracy Project. Jewish Insider reported last year that votes from Chicagoland’s sizable Jewish community are “up for grabs” because no candidate has particularly deep ties to the community.
Kelly has previously traveled to Israel as a member of Congress. In 2016, Kelly met with leaders from Chicago’s Jewish United Fund and Jewish Community Relations Council to discuss her second trip to Israel. “She backs a two-state solution and supports Israel’s ongoing security needs,” the JUF wrote after the meeting.

What Bret Stephens got wrong in his ‘State of World Jewry’ address - opinion
Unknown

Throughout my career, I have been privileged to have many brilliant bosses who have taught me their vision and brought out the best in my work, from my first boss to my current one.
One of the most inspiring was Bret Stephens, who would arrive at The Jerusalem Post’s former decrepit office in Jerusalem’s Romema neighborhood every day dressed in an elegant suit and tie that made him look like one of Barack Obama’s aliens. We all knew his wardrobe was intended as a lesson and a metaphor, and we internalized it.
Stephens brought the Post’s professionalism that shone through in all our work. We had to keep up with his high standards, and I still think of him when I write nowadays, long after he moved on to win the Pulitzer Prize at a young age for his commentary at The Wall Street Journal and to set the public agenda at The New York Times.
I even still take his advice and wear a pink or purple tie when facing the most hostile interviews in order to soften my message.
That was why I listened over and over again to his eloquent and nuanced “State of World Jewry” address that he delivered recently at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, and I encourage you to go to YouTube or Spotify and do the same.
Stephens knew he would ruffle feathers with his call for American Jews to “stop caring” about antisemitism, focus instead on encouraging “Jewish thriving,” and adjust their philanthropy accordingly. He invited his audience and viewers to express their disagreement, so this is my chance.
'Well-meaning but mostly wasted effort': Bret Stephens
“The fight against antisemitism, which consumes tens of billions in Jewish philanthropy, is a well-meaning but mostly wasted effort,” he said in the address, asking the crowd whether anyone thinks the fight against antisemitism is working.
One could agree with Stephens that antisemites cannot be reformed – and do not need to be better informed because they suffer from a disease – without accepting his solution of stopping to try or even care. Had he stopped there, I would not have felt compelled to respond.
But he went further, saying that “the same goes for efforts to improve Israeli advocacy and hasbara [public diplomacy].” He said it would be wrong to think the tide could be turned “if we got the news media to deliver fairer coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” or adopted “history’s most brilliant PR strategy for Israel.”
“I also know that Tucker Carlson’s popularity and influence as a podcaster and political figure has only soared as his bigotry has become more blatant,” he said. “That journalistic disgraces such as the fake report about the 500 dead Palestinians at the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza did nothing to prevent subsequent fake or grossly sensationalized reporting about the war that perpetuated antisemitic stereotypes.”
Sorry, Bret, but I think those efforts since Oct. 7 have not been wasted and actually have been surprisingly effective. I am not referring to efforts by the Israeli government, and neither was he, but about the sweat and tears shed by ordinary Jews around the world as digital warriors fighting for Israel on the media battlefield.
They risked losing friends and even their livelihood, as they defended the Jewish state from modern-day blood libels, even though they knew they were hopelessly outnumbered. They used resources provided by media watchdogs like HonestReporting and educational organizations like StandWithUs, knowing full well that the other side could count on constant funding from the Qataris and a PR strategy hatched by Hamas propaganda chief Abu Obeida long before Oct. 7.
Past wars in Gaza were stopped prematurely, just days into the operation, without key accomplishments, after the world media pressured world leaders to pressure Israel to end the war. We could not afford to let that happen this time around.
I believe that the questioning of the coverage that began after the misreporting of the Al Ahli incident 10 days into the war successfully handicapped that media pressure and enabled the IDF’s efforts to be sustained as long as they were needed to improve Israel’s long-term security.
Of course, fake and sensationalized reporting continued and there were plenty of journalistic disgraces, but they were taken with a grain of salt even larger than in your typical bubbie’s matzah ball soup recipe.
HonestReporting did its job in educating news consumers, and even the bureau chief of Reuters in Lebanon, Maya Gebeily, admitted in a video interview with The Beirut Banyan podcast that media watchdogs made her team extra careful while reporting on Israel.
“We were operating – all journalists at the time and continue to be – in an environment... that is hyper-politicized,” she said. “We’ve seen from various organizations like HonestReporting and other watchdogs that basically look at Western media in particular and try to poke holes in the tweets, in the LinkedIn posts, in the stories of journalists, and try to accuse them of bias.”
I admit that gaining deterrence on the media battlefield against journalists like Gebeily and those Stephens rightfully referred to as “the Hamas water carriers masquerading as reporters by the BBC” is easier than for pundits like Tucker Carlson because they have employers who safeguard their media outlet’s reputation. Carlson long ago lost his shame when spreading lies, and who will we complain to – the emir of Qatar?
Nevertheless, Carlson and his ally Candace Owens must continue to be monitored, exposed, questioned, chastened, and held accountable.
As a proud graduate of the Ida Crown Jewish Academy in Chicago, I absolutely agree with Stephens that much more money must be invested in Jewish day schools with low tuition rates for the Jewish people to thrive. But those schools must teach the most sensitive nuances in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and how it could be weaponized, in order to prepare their pupils for college, even if it means treading into political waters and upsetting parents and benefactors.
And until that happens, young people will continue to get their information from social media and AI platforms with no universal truth, so funding fact-checking organizations with Israel’s interests in mind is actually more imperative than ever.
Stephens concluded that “constantly seeking to prove ourselves worthy in order to win the world’s love is a fool’s errand” and “the goal of Jewish life is not to ingratiate ourselves with others so that they might dislike us somewhat less.”
I might be a fool, but I will not stop trying to get the world to understand Israel better and to empower the young base of future Jewish leaders to realize why Israel is on the right side of history.
To that end, I’ve been part of a special team that was honored at the Knesset for what we did as “Voices of Iron” during the war. I’ve addressed communities and campuses in half the 50 states of the US since Oct. 7, helped train dozens of Chabad campus emissaries, and served as the keynote speaker to a mission to Israel of 14 American campus organizations.
And thanks to Stephens, I even did it wearing a suit and purple tie.

US President Trump announces new 10% tariff on all countries after supreme court loss
Unknown

10:38:36 KST

US President Donald Trump moved swiftly on Friday to replace tariffs struck down by the Supreme Court with a temporary 10% global import duty for 150 days while opening investigations under other laws that could allow him to re-impose the tariffs.
Trump told a briefing he was ordering new tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, duties that would be added to existing tariffs. These would partly replace the 10% to 50% tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the top court declared illegal.
Trump later said on Truth Social that he had signed an order imposing tariffs on all countries, "which will be effective almost immediately."
A spokesperson for the US Customs and Border Protection agency declined to comment when asked when collections of the illegal IEEPA tariffs would halt at ports of entry.
Later on Saturday, Trump announced that he would aim to apply "the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level" tariff on all countries, "many of which have been “ripping” the US off for decades," according to the American president.
Trump's Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, said the new 10% duties and potentially enhanced tariffs under the Section 301 unfair practices statute and the Section 232 national security statute would result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026.
"We will get back to the same tariff level for the countries. It will just be in a less direct and slightly more convoluted manner," Bessent told Fox News, adding that the Supreme Court decision had reduced Trump's negotiating leverage with trading partners.
Never-used presidential powers
The never-used Section 122 authority allows the president to impose duties of up to 15% for up to 150 days on any and all countries to address "large and serious" balance-of-payments issues. It does not require investigations or impose other procedural limits. After 150 days, Congress would need to approve their extension.
"We have alternatives, great alternatives," Trump said. "Could be more money. We'll take in more money, and we'll be a lot stronger for it," Trump said of the alternative tools.
While the administration will likely face legal challenges, the Section 122 tariffs would lapse before any final ruling could be made, said Josh Lipsky, international economics chair at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington.
Trump said his administration was also initiating several new country-specific investigations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 "to protect our country from unfair trading practices of other countries and companies."
Faster investigations
Trump's shift to other statutes, including Section 122, while initiating new investigations under Section 301, had been widely anticipated, but these have often taken a year to complete.
The 10% tariffs only last for five months, but Trump said that would allow his administration to complete investigations to justify higher tariffs.
Asked if rates would ultimately end up being higher after more probes, Trump said: "Potentially higher. It depends. Whatever we want them to be."
He said some countries "that have treated us really badly for years" could see higher tariffs, whereas for others, "it's going to be very reasonable for them."
The fate of dozens of trade deals to cut IEEPA-based duties, as well as negotiations with major US trading partners, remained unclear in the wake of the ruling, though Trump said he expected many of them to continue. He said deals that are abandoned "will be replaced with the other tariffs."
"This is unlikely to affect reciprocal trade negotiations with our trading partners," said Tim Brightbill, trade partner with the law firm Wiley Rein in Washington. "Most countries would prefer the certainty of a trade deal to the chaos of last year."
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said details on new Section 301 investigations would be revealed in the coming days, adding these are "incredibly legally durable." Trump relied on Section 301 to impose broad tariffs on Chinese imports during his first term.
Refunds to be 'litigated'
The Supreme Court's ruling puts about $175 billion in tariff revenue collected over the past year subject to potential refunds, according to estimates provided to Reuters by Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists.
Asked whether he would refund the IEEPA duties, Trump said, "I guess it has to get litigated for the next two years," suggesting that a quick, automatic refund process was unlikely.
Speaking in Dallas, Bessent told business leaders that since the Supreme Court did not provide any instructions on refunds, those were "in dispute," adding: "My sense is that could be dragged out for weeks, months, years."
More procedures
Part of the reason Trump opted for IEEPA to impose tariffs last year was that the 1977 sanctions statute allowed swift, broad action with almost no constraints. Until Friday, he had also used it as a cudgel to swiftly punish countries over non-trade disputes, such as Brazil's prosecution of former president and Trump ally Jair Bolsonaro.
While Trump's new investigations will prolong tariff uncertainty, they could inject more order into his tariff policy by forcing him to rely on trade laws that have well-understood procedures, research, and public comment requirements, and longer timelines, said Janet Whittaker, senior counsel with Clifford Chance in Washington.
"The administration will need to follow these set processes, conduct the investigations, and so for businesses, that means more visibility into the process," Whittaker said.
Robert Lighthizer, Trump's trade chief during his first term, said on Fox News that he hoped Congress would revise decades-old trade laws to give Trump new tariff tools.
"I think there's consensus in this Congress that we have to change the old system, and I hope that they will take this as an opportunity to do that," Lighthizer said.

After Uganda's post-election crackdown, authorities are targeting the last remaining opposition figures

In Uganda, the political repression orchestrated by a regime that has been firmly entrenched in power for 40 years did not conclude with the overwhelming and preordained seventh victory of Yoweri Museveni in the January 15 presidential election. Since then, several dozen protesters have been killed, and hundreds more are languishing in prison. The fate of the two main opposition leaders, Robert Kyagulanyi – known as "Bobi Wine" – and Kizza Besigye, illustrates this stifling of democracy and the versatility of the regime's repressive machinery.
Wine has been living in hiding for a month, evading a manhunt led by the security forces at the behest of Muhoozi Kainerugaba, the chief of the General Staff and the presumed successor to his father, the president. Besigye is waiting in his cell for a trial before a specially convened court that offers little hope of fairness.
Accused of high treason on charges he denies, Besigye is to be tried by military officers sitting in a court-martial, and not by a civilian court as recommended in a Supreme Court ruling issued in January 2025. Since then, Parliament – which merely follows presidential directives – passed a law again allowing military courts to try civilians accused of acts that threaten state security. On Wednesday, February 11, the opposition leader's lawyers formally challenged the constitutionality of this law, but with little hope of being heard.

Opinion | How the next China shock is shaping hearts and minds
No longer confined to trade and technology, competition between China and the West is now playing out in the realm of cultural imagination
For decades, China’s role in the global economy was easy to define. It made things cheaply and at astonishing scale. “Made in China” became shorthand for industrial capacity. It was often contentious, sometimes admired, sometimes feared.
That division is now eroding. In smartphones, electric vehicles (EVs) and digital services, Chinese firms are climbing the value chain, competing with Western companies and, in many sectors, leading globally. But the next China shock may take a different form.
Call it China Shock 2.0 or 3.0, depending on how you count them, but China is no longer just manufacturing the world’s products. It is increasingly manufacturing the world’s preferences, too. Especially among younger consumers, Chinese brands are shaping tastes, aesthetics and the global image of China.
Geopolitically, this shift matters. Competition between China and the West is no longer confined to trade and technology. It is increasingly playing out in the realm of cultural imagination. If tariffs and export controls are tools of hard power rivalry, brands are tools of soft power. The question is how to compete with China in the latter arena.

Moscow’s Gulag museum forced Russians to confront their own history. The Kremlin has decided that era is over. A new ‘Museum of Memory’ has one villain: the Nazis.
Russia is turning one of its last major spaces for confronting Soviet-era repression into a showcase for state-sanctioned patriotism. The Gulag History Museum in Moscow — long a rare institutional refuge for the memory of Stalin’s victims — is becoming a “Museum of Memory” dedicated to what the Kremlin calls the “genocide of the Soviet people” at the hands of Nazi Germany. The transformation encapsulates a broader Kremlin project: not the suppression of historical memory, but its replacement with a competing narrative that serves the present war in Ukraine.

The new entity will take over the building where the Gulag History Museum operated until it was forced to suspend operations in November 2024, officially over fire-safety violations. Natalya Kalashnikova, a veteran of both Russia’s energy sector and its war in Ukraine, will lead the new museum. The old institution’s collections will be consigned to storage. The new genocide exhibition will reportedly draw on archives from the ”No Statute of Limitations” project, which has already reached Russian classrooms, where schools have organized students into staged commemorations, sometimes making them kneel for the Nazis’ victims.
The concept of “genocide of the Soviet people” has no grounding in Soviet-era historiography or established international law. President Putin introduced the terminology into Russian public discourse in July 2020, when he declared that Nazi crimes against Soviet citizens “have no statute of limitations” and should be recognized as genocide both at home and globally. Russian courts moved quickly: By October 2020, a court had recognized wartime mass killings as genocide for the first time, and in 2022, the Siege of Leningrad received the same designation. A law ”On Perpetuating the Memory of Victims of the Genocide of the Soviet People” followed in April 2025. State Duma deputies have since proposed criminal penalties for denying that this genocide occurred.
Since April 2025, Natalya Kalashnikova has run the Smolensk Fortress museum, where she has regularly welcomed veterans of the war in Ukraine. She has made nearly monthly trips to the front — in what capacity, her institution has not said — and holds medals for participation in the ”special military operation” and for contributions to Russia’s defense.
In contrast to Kalashnikova’s militant patriotism, her eldest son, now 31, left Russia for Austria just a week before the full-scale invasion began and has not returned. Dmitry Kalashnikov, an alumnus of both the Moscow Conservatory and London’s Royal College of Music, continues to perform abroad; in May 2022, he received one of the Royal College’s top honors from then-Prince Charles.
Before moving into cultural administration, Kalashnikova worked in Russia’s energy sector, overseeing the creation of Krymenergo, the utility established after Russia’s annexation of Crimea. She met the Gulag museum’s existing staff for the first time on February 20, 2026, the same day her appointment was announced.
The institution she is inheriting operated under fundamentally different principles. Founded in 2001, the Gulag History Museum survived until November 2024 as Russia’s only major center preserving the memory of Soviet political repression, serving as a counterweight to the historical amnesia promoted by the Kremlin. The museum’s previous director, Roman Romanov — who held the post from 2012 until he was dismissed in early 2025 — was reportedly forced out after refusing to remove sections about Soviet state violence from an exhibition on Moscow’s history. Putin subsequently removed him from the Presidential Human Rights Council.
One museum employee told the news website Gazeta.ru that the staff is at a loss: “Everyone is confused, trying to decide whether to stay or go. The exhibition will be completely redone, everything will be new. The Gulag museum’s collection will stay in storage — it will just lie there.”
Kalashnikova described the changes as a “reorganization” and said the collection cannot legally be destroyed, as all items are registered state property. She added, with an air of circular logic, that before anyone discusses an opening date, the building’s safety would need to be assessed. “We have to check out the fire situation first — you remember those issues,” she told her new colleagues.

‘Embarrassment to their families’: Trump denounces Supreme Court justices after tariffs ruling
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump on Feb 20 lashed out at the US Supreme Court and the six justices who struck down his signature global tariffs
Although previous presidents have sharply criticised Supreme Court rulings against them, Mr Trump’s lengthy tirade to reporters at the White House stood out for its contemptuous tone, as well as the personal nature of his scorn and praise.
It represented a remarkable attack by a sitting president against the top US judicial body, even after Mr Trump and other senior officials in his administration over the past year have assailed lower-court judges for rulings that have impeded his policies since he returned to office in January 2025.
The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, had over the past year permitted Mr Trump’s expansive assertion of executive power with few exceptions, in a series of decisions issued on an emergency basis.
But the Feb 20 ruling delivered Mr Trump a stinging defeat. It was authored by Chief Justice John Roberts and joined by two fellow conservatives whom Mr Trump had appointed during his first term in office – Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett – as well as the three liberal justices.
“The Supreme Court’s ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing. And I’m ashamed of certain members of the court – absolutely ashamed – for not having the courage to do what’s right for our country,” Mr Trump said at the opening of remarks that lasted 45 minutes.
Speaking to reporters from behind a dimly lit lectern in the White House briefing room, he impugned the patriotism of some of the justices and claimed that the court “has been swayed by foreign interests”, but declined to provide any evidence.
And he heaped scorn on Mr Gorsuch and Ms Barrett for joining the 6-3 majority ruling that sank his tariffs policy – a favourite foreign policy cudgel – imposed under a law meant for national emergencies.
“I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, you wanna know the truth, the two of them,” Mr Trump said, referring to Mr Gorsuch and Ms Barrett.
Mr Trump spoke glowingly of a dissenting opinion written on Feb 20 by his other court appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, that was joined by fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
“I’d like to thank and congratulate Justices Thomas, Alito and Kavanaugh for their strength and wisdom and love of our country, which is, right now, very proud of those justices,” Mr Trump said. “When you read the dissenting opinions, there’s no way that anyone can argue against them.”
Mr Kavanaugh wrote that the court’s ruling against Mr Trump did not necessarily foreclose the President “from imposing most, if not all, of these same sorts of tariffs under other statutory authorities”, adding that “the court’s decision is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward”.
“In essence, the court today concludes that the President checked the wrong statutory box by relying on (an emergency economic powers law) rather than another statute to impose these tariffs.”
Mr Trump repeatedly mentioned Mr Kavanaugh, whom he appointed to a lifetime position on the court in 2018 and stuck with through a bruising Senate confirmation battle in which the nominee denied allegations of sexual assault dating back decades.
“I would like to thank Justice Kavanaugh for his, frankly, his genius and his great ability,” Mr Trump said. “Very proud of that appointment.”
He called the three liberal justices “the Democrats on the court”.
“They’re an automatic no, just like in Congress. They’re an automatic no. They’re against anything that makes America strong, healthy and great again,” Mr Trump said. “They also are a, frankly, disgrace to our nation, those justices.” REUTERS

An American citizen was shot dead by Immigration and Customs Enforcement months before the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota, records have shown.
Ruben Ray Martinez was killed during a traffic stop on South Padre Island in Texas last March, several outlets, citing documents obtained by nonprofit watchdog American Oversight, reported.
Martinez had just turned 23, and he and his best friend were driving from San Antonio to South Padre Island to celebrate, his mother, Rachel Reyes, told the Associated Press.
Shortly after midnight on March 15, 2025, a driver, confirmed by family to be Martinez, and a passenger in a blue Ford were passing through an intersection where Homeland Security Investigations officers had been helping South Padre Island police redirect traffic after an accident, according to an internal ICE incident report included in the new release of documents.
Reyes confirmed to the Associated Press that the victim in the report was her son, and Charles Stam, a lawyer for Martinez’s family, also confirmed Martinez was the one killed to The New York Times.
Agents surrounded Martinez’s car and ordered him and the passenger to get out, according to the report. Martinez “accelerated forward” and hit an HSI special agent, “who wound up on the hood of the vehicle,” the report said.
An HSI supervisory special agent then fired multiple times through the open driver’s side window, according to the report.
Martinez was taken to a hospital and later died, the report said. The HSI agent hit by the car was treated for a knee injury, according to the report.
“It was his first time getting to go out of town,” Reyes said of her son. “He was a nice guy, humble guy. And he wasn’t a violent person at all.”
It’s unclear why Martinez was stopped in the first place.
Without confirming the identity of the victim, the Department of Homeland Security said a federal agent had fatally shot a man that day in March to “protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public.”
“A driver of a blue Ford intentionally ran over a Homeland Security Investigation special agent resulting in him being on the hood of the vehicle. Upon witnessing this, another agent fired defensive shots to protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public,” a DHS spokesperson told The Independent. “This incident is under active investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety Ranger Division.”
According to the Associated Press, Martinez’s death is one of at least six fatal shootings by federal immigration agents since the start of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, which has grown increasingly unpopular.
The Trump administration sparked nationwide backlash over the deaths of Good, a mom of three, and Pretti, an ICU nurse. Both were gunned down by federal agents in the streets of Minneapolis last month. Both were 37-year-old U.S. citizens.
Both shootings have been framed by the Trump administration as self-defense, a claim that has been scrutinized.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, while just 38 percent approve, the lowest level since the president returned to the White House.

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in eastern Pacific, killing 3

3 killed after US military strikes boat engaging in ‘narco-trafficking operation’
This strike brings the total number of deaths from the Trump administration's attacks on alleged drug boats to at least 148 people
- Bookmark
The United States military has confirmed another deadly strike on a vessel suspected of drug trafficking in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, resulting in three fatalities. This latest incident contributes to a rising death toll from such operations.
US Southern Command stated on social media that the boat "was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations." A video accompanying the post depicted a boat ablaze in the water.
This strike brings the total number of deaths from the Trump administration's attacks on alleged drug boats to at least 148 people across at least 43 incidents since early September, spanning the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean.
Donald Trump has previously declared the US to be in "armed conflict" with cartels in Latin America, justifying these attacks as a "necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs."
However, his administration has provided scant evidence to substantiate claims of eliminating "narcoterrorists."
Critics have raised significant questions regarding both the legality and effectiveness of these strikes.
Concerns are amplified by the fact that fentanyl, a primary cause of fatal overdoses, is typically trafficked into the US over land from Mexico, where it is produced using chemicals imported from China and India.
The military's actions have also drawn intense scrutiny following revelations that survivors of an initial boat attack were subsequently killed in a follow-up strike.
While the Trump administration and many Republican lawmakers defended these actions as legal and necessary, Democratic lawmakers and legal experts condemned them as murder or potentially a war crime.
Last week, the White House shared that 11 people were killed in three separate strikes within 24 hours.
While the military did not present direct evidence that the boats were transporting drugs, it did release videos depicting their destruction.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared earlier this month that “some top cartel drug-traffickers” in the region “have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” However, Hegseth did not provide any details or information to back up this claim, made in a post on his personal account on social media.

Trump furious after Supreme Court upends his global tariffs, imposes new 10% levy
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 20 - U.S. President Donald Trump responded with fury to Friday's Supreme Court ruling that he lacked the power to unilaterally set tariffs on imports, denouncing individual justices as he vowed to continue a global trade war that has kept the world on edge for a year.
Saying he was undeterred by what he repeatedly called a ridiculous ruling, Trump announced an immediate new 10% tariff on imports from all countries, on top of any existing tariffs, and then issued a proclamation putting them into effect. The law allows him to impose a levy of up to 15% for 150 days, although it could face legal challenges.
The court's landmark 6-3 ruling upended the leverage Trump and his trade envoys have wielded over foreign governments at negotiating tables to reshape diplomatic relations and global markets.
The ruling briefly sent U.S. stock indexes surging, before ending modestly higher as analysts warned of renewed confusion in global markets while they await Trump's next moves.
Hours after the ruling, Trump signed an executive order repealing the tariffs that the court struck down, and he also issued a proclamation imposing a 10% duty on most goods imported into the U.S. for 150 days, granting exemptions for certain items including critical minerals, metals and energy products, the White House said.
TRADE DEALS, REVENUE IN QUESTION
The ruling called into question the trade deals Trump's envoys have negotiated in recent months under the threat of high tariffs. It left open the fate of the $175 billion Trump has collected from U.S. importers under what the court said was his incorrect reading of the law.
"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump told reporters at the White House, complaining that foreign countries were ecstatic and "dancing in the street."
He insinuated, without evidence, that the majority of the court caved to foreign influence: "They're very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution. It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think."
Since returning to the White House 13 months ago, Trump has said he had what the court summarized as the "extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope." Citing a national emergency, he said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) meant he could set tariffs at any rate he chose.
The court grounded its opinion, which was written by Chief Justice John Roberts, with a quote from the U.S. Constitution: “The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”
The argument by the Trump administration that it had identified a war-like emergency to justify a loophole failed to persuade the court.
"The Government thus concedes, as it must, that the President enjoys no inherent authority to impose tariffs during peacetime," Roberts wrote.
"And it does not defend the challenged tariffs as an exercise of the President’s warmaking powers. The United States, after all, is not at war with every nation in the world."
Despite the court's bluntness in ruling the president had exceeded his authority, Trump told reporters: "It's ridiculous, but it's OK, because we have other ways, numerous other ways."
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY RISES
After a year of Trump's often ad hoc tariff announcements whipsawing markets and the global economy, the ruling and Trump's response reintroduced a hefty dose of uncertainty that economists, investors and policymakers had hoped was in the rearview mirror.
"I think it will just bring in a new period of high uncertainty in world trade, as everybody tries to figure out what the U.S. tariff policy will be going forward," said Varg Folkman, analyst at the European Policy Centre think tank.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the court ruling could have mixed results.
"The Supreme Court has taken away the President's leverage, but in a way, they have made the leverage that he has more draconian because they agreed he does have the right to a full embargo," Bessent told "The Will Cain Show" on Fox News.
"We will get back to the same tariff level for the countries. It will just be in a less direct and slightly more convoluted manner," he said.
In announcing his new temporary 10% tariff, Trump became the first president to invoke Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows the president to levy tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days to fix "fundamental international payments problems." That, too, could draw legal challenges. Such tariffs can only be extended with Congress' authorization. REUTERS

US experts warn Saudi uranium enrichment possible under proposed US nuclear deal

Saudi Arabia may be allowed to enrich uranium on its own soil under a proposed nuclear agreement with the United States, according to U.S. congressional documents and arms control experts who warn of proliferation risks as Washington negotiates with Iran and considers possible military action against it. Riyadh did not respond to questions from The Associated Press on the matter.
President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden have previously sought to reach a nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia to share American technology. Nuclear nonproliferation experts caution that any centrifuge spinning in the kingdom could open the door to a weapons of mass destruction program, an issue Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously suggested he would pursue if Iran were to obtain a nuclear bomb.
Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan signed a mutual defense agreement last year following an Israeli strike on senior Hamas officials in Qatar. Pakistan’s defense minister said at the time that his country’s nuclear program would be “made available” to Saudi Arabia if necessary. The remarks were widely interpreted as a warning to Israel, which according to foreign reports is considered the only Middle Eastern country possessing nuclear weapons.
“Nuclear cooperation can be a positive mechanism for maintaining nonproliferation norms and increasing transparency, but the devil is in the details,” wrote Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. The documents raise “concerns that the Trump administration has not carefully considered the proliferation risks posed by its proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia or the precedent that such an agreement could create,” she wrote.
US competition with rival powers
A congressional document, also reviewed by AP, indicates that the Trump administration aims to secure 20 nuclear deals with countries worldwide, including Saudi Arabia. It notes that an agreement with Riyadh could generate billions of dollars. Reaching a deal with Saudi Arabia would “advance the national security interests of the United States and break from the failed policy of inaction and indecision that our competitors have exploited to undermine the American industry and the global standing of the United States in this field,” the document states. China, France, Russia and South Korea are among the leading exporters of nuclear power plant technology.
According to the documents, the draft agreement would include the signing of safeguards agreements with the United Nations’ International Atomic Energy Agency. The deal would provide oversight of “the most sensitive areas for potential nuclear weapons proliferation.” The IAEA did not respond to AP’s questions. Saudi Arabia, which is a member of the agency, also did not comment on the report.
“This indicates that once the bilateral safeguards agreement enters into force, it would open the door for Saudi Arabia to acquire uranium enrichment technology or capabilities, even from the United States,” Davenport wrote. “Even with various restrictions, it appears quite likely that Saudi Arabia would have a pathway to some form of uranium enrichment or access to enrichment knowledge.”

FBI investigating ‘terrorism-related’ event after driver rammed car into Nevada power substation
The driver was a 23-year-old man from New York
- Bookmark
Police and the FBI are investigating after a car filled with weapons was rammed into a power substation near the Hoover Dam Thursday, in what has been described as a "terrorism-related event.”
It is the latest in a string of incidents targeting electric infrastructure in recent years but there is no ongoing threat to the public, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a news conference Friday.
Police received a 911 call at 10 a.m. Thursday reporting a vehicle had crashed through a secured gate at the substation in Boulder City, located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Las Vegas, McMahill said.
A witness called in the incident after seeing the car crash then hearing gunshots, according to the sheriff. The driver of the vehicle was 23-year-old Dawson Maloney of Albany, New York, police said.
Prior to the crash, Maloney had been reported missing. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, McMahill said.
Security video, shared by Vegas police, shows a vehicle speeding towards the facility, swerving past a gate, then driving through a chainlink fence.
Maloney’s vehicle, a rented Nissan Sentra, later crashed into large wooden bales of wire, police photos show. Fallen traffic cones were strewn across the substation in the wake of the incident.
The man communicated with family members before the crash, referencing self-harm, and said he was going to commit an act that would gain media attention. He referred to himself as a terrorist in a message sent to his mother, police said.
Authorities found explosive materials and multiple books “related to extremist ideologies” in Maloney’s hotel room, McMahill said. The books included ones about right- and left-wing extremism, environmental extremism, white supremacism and anti-government ideology, he said. Police photos also show multiple U.S. military weapons manuals recovered from his possessions.
“These findings significantly elevate the seriousness of this incident,” McMahill said during the press conference.
The official described the materials as a "smorgasbord of radical literature” and said law enforcement agencies are seeing a rise in individuals combining disparate extremist ideas.
“This is something that we have seen in the last couple of years that individuals will take very left-wing ideology, very right-wing ideology, combine it ... and then they come up with their own, their own ideology," he said.
Hotel guest Logan Stubbs said he saw Maloney before the crash.
"He had his hoodie up and just looked really sketchy,” Stubbs told ABC7. “There was just something off about him.”
Maloney is listed as a student at Albany Law School in the class of 2027. He was also an honors student at New York’s Siena University.
“We are heartbroken to hear of the tragic passing of one of our law students, Dawson Maloney, in an off-campus incident,” Tom Torello, director of communications and marketing at Albany Law School, said in a statement.
Two shotguns, an assault rifle-style pistol, and flame throwers were found in his rental car, McMahill said. A police photo shows the weapons piled on top of each other near one of the car seats. About six shotgun shells can be seen nearby. Maloney was wearing what police described as “soft-body armor” at the time of the crash.
Authorities recovered a 3D printer and several gun components needed to assemble a firearm from an Albany residence. Officials have searched two Albany residences overall as part of their investigation.
Maloney had driven a rental car from Albany to Boulder City, according to Christopher Delzano, the FBI's Las Vegas special agent-in-charge.
The New York man rented the car on February 12 and began driving across the country two days later.
Boulder City is home to the Hoover Dam, providing water to millions of people across Nevada, Arizona and California. The power substation that was rammed is owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
Boulder City Police Chief Timothy Shea said there was no evidence of major damage to critical infrastructure and no service disruptions as a result of the crash.
In 2023, a man rammed a car through a fence at a solar power facility in the desert northeast of Las Vegas, setting the car on fire. The solar power facility served Las Vegas Strip casinos. He was declared unfit for trial.
Electrical substations have also been targeted in Washington, Oregon and North Carolina.
“The risk is continued disruption of our economic system in our country — not only that, but there’s also lives at stake,” Jon Wellinghoff, a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told The New York Times after the incident in North Carolina.
Extremists have targeted such infrastructure for a variety of reasons, according to experts, including “accelerationist” views that seek to hasten the collapse of society.

US citizen shot and killed by federal immigration agent last year, new records show

Newly released records show a US citizen was shot and killed in Texas by a federal immigration agent last year during a late-night traffic encounter that was not publicly disclosed by the Department of Homeland Security.
The death of Ruben Ray Martinez, 23, would mark the earliest of at least six deadly shootings by federal officers since the start of a nationwide immigration crackdown in Donald Trump’s second term. On Friday, DHS said the shooting on South Padre Island last March occurred after the driver intentionally struck an agent.
The shooting involved a Homeland Security Investigations team that was conducting an immigration enforcement operation in conjunction with local police, according to documents obtained by American Oversight, a non-profit watchdog group based in Washington.
The records are part of a tranche of heavily redacted internal documents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement that the non-profit obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
Though Martinez’s death on 15 March 2025 was reported by local media outlets at the time, federal and state authorities did not disclose that the shooting involved the team from HSI. In a statement Friday, DHS said the driver who was killed “intentionally ran over a Homeland Security Investigation special agent”, resulting in another agent firing “defensive shots to protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public”.
The department did not respond to questions about why it had made no media release or other public notification of the officer-involved shooting over the last 11 months.
Martinez’s mother, Rachel Reyes, said her son was just days past his 23rd birthday when he and his best friend drove from San Antonio down to the beach for the weekend to celebrate. South Padre Island, located on the Gulf coast just north of the US-Mexico border, is a renowned spring break destination that attracts tens of thousands of college-aged partiers each March.
According to an internal two-page ICE incident report included in the newly disclosed documents, shortly after midnight, HSI officers were assisting South Padre Island police by redirecting traffic through a busy intersection after a vehicle accident with several injuries.
A blue, four-door Ford with a driver and passenger approached the officers, who ordered the driver to stop. The report does not say why. Initially, the driver didn’t respond to commands but did eventually come to a stop, according to the report.
Agents then surrounded the vehicle, telling those inside to get out, but the driver “accelerated forward” and struck an HSI special agent “who wound up on the hood of the vehicle”, the report said. An HSI supervisory special agent standing by the side of the car then fired his weapon multiple times through the open driver’s-side window, and the vehicle stopped.
Paramedics already on the scene of the accident quickly provided medical aid and the driver was taken by ambulance to a regional hospital in Brownsville, where he was pronounced dead, according to the report. The passenger, also a US citizen, was taken into custody.
The HSI officer whom the report says was struck by the vehicle was treated for an unspecified knee injury at a nearby hospital and released.
The names of the two HSI agents involved in the shooting and the names of the two men in the car were all redacted from the ICE report, but Reyes confirmed the driver was her son. She said he was shot three times.
Reyes said she first learned her son had been shot by a federal agent, rather than a local police officer, about a week after he was killed. She was contacted by an investigator from the Texas Rangers, the lead agency looking into the shooting. Reyes said the investigator told her there were videos of the shooting that contradicted the account provided by federal agents. DHS did not immediately respond to an email Friday about the claim that there is video showing a different account.
She said she was told by the investigator that the state report into the shooting was completed in October and that the case would be presented to a grand jury for potential criminal charges.
The Texas department of public safety, which includes the Rangers, said in a statement Friday that the investigation into the shooting was still “active” and declined to offer more information.

Three dead in latest US strike on alleged drug boat: Pentagon

WASHINGTON - US forces on Feb 20 launched a strike against alleged drug traffickers in the Eastern Pacific, killing three people, the military said.
“Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations” along an apparent narco-trafficking route, the US Southern Command posted on X, adding that “three male narco-terrorists were killed during this action”.
The post included black and white video of the strike that showed an aerial view of a boat before it is bombed and engulfed in flames.
The United States began targeting alleged smuggling boats in early September, killing nearly 150 people in total and destroying dozens of vessels since then.
Under President Donald Trump, the United States has routinely conducted these strikes without offering definitive evidence of illegal activity, leading legal experts to raise concerns that the deaths could be considered extra-judicial killings.
The strikes are part of a campaign that Mr Trump’s administration has insisted is needed to combat drug trafficking.
It has also stationed naval forces off the coast of South America, seized oil tankers and carried out a stunning raid that captured Venezuela’s leftist leader Nicolas Maduro.
Maduro is incarcerated in the US awaiting trial for drug and weapons charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. AFP

Supreme Court checks Trump's expansive view of executive power
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON, Feb 20 - For more than a year, Donald Trump has moved through Washington like a monarch, in a capital increasingly shaped by his power, threats and whims.
On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court abruptly altered that trajectory. In striking down his administration’s signature economic policy, the justices delivered a rare and public rebuke that signaled the dominant Republican president had finally reached the limits of his authority.
Trump’s reaction was immediate and visceral.
Upon learning of the ruling, Trump told governors gathered at the White House that he was "seething" and had to do something about the courts, said Delaware Governor Matt Meyer, a Democrat who was in the room.
Later, in front of reporters, Trump tore into the justices who ruled against him - including two of his own nominees - calling them weak, a disgrace and an "embarrassment to their families." He scoffed at what he cast as the majority’s tortured logic.
"For someone who never admits losing," said Chris Borick, a pollster and political science professor at Pennsylvania’s Muhlenberg College, "this is a pretty significant loss."
TRUMP'S FAVORITE WORD
Few policies have defined Trump’s second term in office more than his aggressive use of tariffs. To Trump, a tariff is not just a tax imposed on goods when they cross the U.S. border, but "my favorite word" and "the most beautiful word in the dictionary," as he has repeatedly told supporters.
He has wielded the threat of tariffs as a cudgel to extract concessions on soybean purchases, win billions in foreign investment pledges, stem the flow of narcotics, wade into international conflicts, adjust prescription drug prices and boost favored U.S. industries.
The Republican-controlled Congress, despite its constitutional authority over taxation, mostly stood aside.
The conservative Supreme Court often enhanced Trump's power, granting him immunity for his actions in office and issuing emergency rulings that favored his policies.
But the court's 6-3 decision on Friday, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, punctured Trump's long-held assertion that he could impose sweeping tariffs in the name of U.S. economic security. The ruling injected fresh uncertainty into a political landscape already shaped by volatile markets, uneasy foreign partners and looming midterm elections that could further curtail Trump’s power.
"It is a blow to his expansive vision of emergency powers, which was the pillar for his entire economic agenda and more," said Julian E. Zelizer, presidential historian at Princeton University.
WOUNDED PRESIDENT LASHES OUT
Met with the biggest setback of his current term in office, an angry Trump responded characteristically: lashing out at those who dared to stand in his way, while still claiming victory.
Under theatrically dimmed lights in the White House press briefing room, Trump berated judges he had appointed. He suggested that their ruling had clarified his broad powers to use tariffs or cut off trade with other countries entirely. And he quoted a dissenting Supreme Court opinion that said the decision might not substantially constrain a president's ability to order tariffs in the future.
"I can charge much more than I was charging," Trump concluded.
"It's a little more complicated," he said. "The process takes a little more time, but the end result is going to get us more money, and I think it's going to be great."
Asked if he would ask Congress to give him the powers the Supreme Court said he did not have, Trump was defiant.
"No, I don't need to, it's already been approved," he said. "I mean, I would ask Congress and probably get it."
No president has used the law that was in dispute, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as expansively as Trump. And despite his bravado at Friday’s press briefing, the alternative laws he could tap to impose tariffs would be slower to implement, require more exhaustive justification and come with time limits.
"The presidency is definitely weaker" as a result of the ruling, said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law. "He's weaker." REUTERS

US military says it attacked vessel in Pacific Ocean, killing three people
The US military's Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) claimed the vessel was involved in drug trafficking, without providing any evidence.
The United States military said it attacked a boat in the eastern Pacific, killing three people, in the latest strike on a vessel in international waters that Washington alleges was involved in drug trafficking.
US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which is responsible for military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, said three men were killed in the attack on Friday, describing the operation as a “lethal kinetic strike” in an area of the Pacific Ocean that was a “known narco-trafficking route”.

No evidence was provided to support the US military’s claim that the three victims were involved in drug trafficking.
The killings on Friday raise the death toll from US President Donald Trump’s administration’s attacks on vessels in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea to at least 148 people killed in some 43 attacks carried out by the US military since early September.
Latin American leaders, legal experts and human rights workers have questioned the legality of the military campaign, accusing US forces of carrying out extrajudicial killings in international waters where Washington has no jurisdiction.
A short video clip, apparently featuring the latest attack, was released on social media by SOUTHCOM, showing a stationary boat with outboard engines bursting into flames and drifting after being hit by US fire.
Earlier this week, SOUTHCOM said it carried out three attacks on vessels in the Pacific and Caribbean, killing 11 people in total.
Ben Saul, the United Nations special rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism, said the US military’s announcements of its attacks on vessels amounted to confessing to the “murder of civilians at sea”.
“US leaders must be held accountable by US or international justice,” Saul said.
Officials in the Trump administration, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and US Admiral Frank Bradley, have come under scrutiny for reports that the first attack on a vessel, which took place in September 2025, included a follow-up strike that killed survivors who were clinging to the wreckage of a boat.
Legal experts said the US military committed a crime if it deliberately targeted and killed the survivors of a shipwreck.
Critics have also questioned why the Trump administration is targeting alleged drug trafficking by sea when the fentanyl, which is responsible for many fatal overdoses in the US, is more commonly smuggled into the US by land from neighbouring Mexico.

Trump ends some tariffs, imposes new global one

Trump ends some tariffs, imposes new 10% global one
February 21, 2026After the US Supreme Court on Friday struck down sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, the White House announced the end of certain duties enacted under a law used to address national emergencies.
The White House said those tariffs "shall no longer be in effect and, as soon as practicable, shall no longer be collected."
Undeterred by the Supreme Court ruling, Trump said later on Friday in a post on his Truth Social platform that he had the "Great Honor" to sign an order imposing temporary 10% tariffs on global imports to be "effective almost immediately."
The move comes after the conservative-majority Supreme Court said the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump had originally used to impose tariffs, "does not authorize the president to impose tariffs."
The new 10% tariff is scheduled to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday (0601 Wednesday UTC/GMT) and can initially last 150 days. The White House said the new import duty will not apply to certain food products and to important minerals or goods already subject to separate tariffs that remain in place after the top court's ruling.
Trump's use of tariffs for political policies
The court's decision upholds a lower court ruling from May that found Trump had overstepped his authority by unilaterally declaring punitive and "reciprocal" tariffs. The government had appealed the lower court ruling.
Trump has routinely levied or threatened to levy such penalties on trading partners for a host of reasons ranging from vague claims of unfair treatment to attempting to influence foreign courts to help his political allies abroad. The US Constitution gives Congress the sole power to levy tariffs.
Though other presidents have made ample use of the IEEPA, often to impose sanctions, Trump is the first president to use it for import taxes.
What did the Supreme Court rule?
In Friday's majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts declared, "The Framers [of the US Constitution] did not vest any part of the taxing power in the Executive Branch."
The court found that, "had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs" with IEEPA, "it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes."
In a statement put out after news of the decision broke, Canadian Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Candace Laing called it a legal ruling, not a policy reset, adding, "Canada should prepare for new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects."
Trump goes off on 'unpatriotic' Supreme Court justices
Hours after the news broke, Trump called the decision "deeply disappointing" and directed his ire at those justices who voted against his tariff authority.
"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court for not having the courage to do what's right," he said, labeling those who voted against his power to unilaterally levy tariffs a "disgrace to the nation."
Trump appointed three justices to the Supreme Court in his first term, only Justice Brett Kavanaugh voted in his favor, while Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch were part of the majority.
Trump later called the two a "embarrassment to their families" without going so far as to say that he regretted having appointed them.
He then maligned the court's liberal justices as "unpatriotic" and anti-American.
After claiming that the court was under the sway of foreign influences and threatening investigations, Trump said foreign countries are "dancing in the streets [over the decision], but they won't be dancing for long."
He said many more measures are in the works and brushed off a question about the need to consult Congress moving forward, saying: "I don't have to. I have the right to do tariffs, and I've always had the right to do tariffs," seemingly ignoring the court's decision.
When asked if the decision would result in even higher tariffs, Trump said, "possibly."
First time Supreme Court has moved to limit Trump's executive power
Friday's decision, which saw conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh dissenting, marked the first time the Supreme Court has taken steps to rein in Trump's executive authority.
Writing the dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said Friday's decision "is not likely to greatly restrict presidential tariff authority going forward."
Trump had been outspoken about the case before Friday, warning that striking down his ability to levy tariffs would be an economic body blow to the country.
The Congressional Budget Office previously released projections estimating the tariffs would generate $3 trillion (€2.54 trillion) in revenue over the next decade.
In December, the US Treasury claimed to have collected some $133 billion in tariff revenue.
Despite these claims, Trump's tariff policy remains unpopular with US taxpayers and businesses.
Though Friday's decision will keep Trump from applying tariffs under the IEEPA, administration officials say they expect the tariff framework to remain in place under other authorities.
The administration has argued that the tariffs are paid by ill-behaved trading partners, but experts say US consumers and businesses are bearing the brunt of the economic hit.
Ahead of Friday's Supreme Court decision, companies such as Costco insisted they deserve a refund for the losses they have incurred as a result of the president's policies.
In his dissent, Kavanaugh wrote, "The court says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers. But that process is likely to be a 'mess,' as was acknowledged at oral argument."
Tariff ruling undercuts Trump's leverage, says Bessent
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the Supreme Court has taken away Trump's leverage with its decision.
"The Supreme Court has taken away the president's leverage, but in a way, they have made the leverage that he has more draconian because they agreed he does have the right to a full embargo," Bessent told "The Will Cain Show" on Fox News.
"We will get back to the same tariff level for the countries. It will just be in a less direct and slightly more convoluted manner," he said.
Bessent also stressed that he believed every country was going to honor the trade agreements made with the Trump administration over the last year.
"He (Trump) has a right to a complete embargo, he can just cut countries off ... or he can cut whole product lines off. We can't receive any money. So, I would call on all countries to honor their agreements and move forward," Bessent underlined.
EU calls for policy stability as it shifts posture
Reacting to the decision, EU Trade & Economic Security spokesman Olof Gil wrote on X, "Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship. We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them."
As a result of US badgering, the EU and other US trading partners have shifted alliances away from Washington, instead signing extensive trade agreements with China and India, for instance, in pursuit of economic cooperation.
Jürgen Hardt, politician and foreign policy spokesperson for Germany's governing Christian Democrats (CDU), told DW that it's "too early to judge" on whether the Supreme Court ruling will lead to any meaningful change in the Trump administration's conduct of trade relations.
Hardt believes Trump will have to weigh the consequences of his politics carefully until the US midterm elections later this year.
The German parliamentarian also expressed hope that the latest development could provide fresh momentum for trade negotiations between the US and the European Union. "I think we also have to think about what is the consequence for us, maybe a new momentum in trade negotiations with the US and also new momentum for some parts of the business," he stressed.
Agathe Demarais, a senior policy adviser at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), told DW she expects the Trump administration to pursue other avenues to keep tariffs in place, while at the same time emphasizing that they have failed to deliver the economic boost the president claimed they would when he introduced them.
"For starters, the US goods trade deficit grew by 2.1%, to $1.23 trillion last year — an all-time record. Far from shrinking, US imports grew by 4.5% (or $145 billion)" in 2025, she said.
"As to who pays for tariffs," said Demarais, "the data are unambiguous: According to a recent paper from the Kiel Institute, which analyzed over 25 million shipments worth nearly $4 trillion, US firms and consumers bear 96% of tariff costs — not foreign exporters. New York Fed data confirm this analysis, putting tariff pass-through at more than 90% on average."

These shy, scaly anteaters are the most trafficked mammals in the world
Conservationists are raising the plight of the pangolin, a scaly anteater found in parts of Africa and Asia that is the most trafficked mammal in the world
- Bookmark
They are hunted for their unique scales, and the demand makes them the most trafficked mammal in the world.
Wildlife conservationists are again raising the plight of pangolins, the shy, scaly anteaters found in parts of Africa and Asia, on World Pangolin Day on Saturday.
Pangolins or pangolin products outstrip any other mammal when it comes to wildlife smuggling, with more than half a million pangolins seized in anti-trafficking operations between 2016 and 2024, according to a report last year by CITES, the global authority on the trading of endangered plant and animal species.
The World Wildlife Fund estimates that over a million pangolins were taken from the wild over the last decade, including those that were never intercepted.
Pangolins meat is a delicacy in places, but the driving force behind the illegal trade is their scales, which are made of keratin, the protein also found in human hair and fingernails. The scales are in high demand in China and other parts of Asia due to the unproven belief that they cure a range of ailments when made into traditional medicine.
There are eight pangolin species, four in Africa and four in Asia. All of them face a high, very high or extremely high risk of extinction.
While they're sometimes known as scaly anteaters, pangolins are not related in any way to anteaters or armadillos.
They are unique in that they are the only mammals covered completely in keratin scales, which overlap and have sharp edges. They are the perfect defense mechanism, allowing a pangolin to roll up into an armored ball that even lions struggle to get to grip with, leaving the nocturnal ant and termite eaters with few natural predators.
But they have no real defense against human hunters. And in conservation terms, they don't resonate in the way that elephants, rhinos or tigers do despite their fascinating intricacies — like their sticky insect-nabbing tongues being almost as long as their bodies.
While some reports indicate a downward trend in pangolin trafficking since the COVID-19 pandemic, they are still being poached at an alarming rate across parts of Africa, according to conservationists.
Nigeria is one of the global hot spots. There, Dr. Mark Ofua, a wildlife veterinarian and the West Africa representative for the Wild Africa conservation group, has rescued pangolins for more than a decade, which started with him scouring bushmeat markets for animals he could buy and save. He runs an animal rescue center and a pangolin orphanage in Lagos.
His mission is to raise awareness of pangolins in Nigeria through a wildlife show for kids and a tactic of convincing entertainers, musicians and other celebrities with millions of social media followers to be involved in conservation campaigns — or just be seen with a pangolin.
Nigeria is home to three of the four African pangolin species, but they are not well known among the country's 240 million people.
Ofua's drive for pangolin publicity stems from an encounter with a group of well-dressed young men while he was once transporting pangolins he had rescued in a cage. The men pointed at them and asked him what they were, Ofua said.
“Oh, those are baby dragons,” he joked. But it got him thinking.
“There is a dark side to that admission,” Ofua said. “If people do not even know what a pangolin looks like, how do you protect them?”

China youth ditch fast living to become ‘old-school humans’; stories get 1 billion views online
Young people are turning their backs on parties, fashion and fine dining in hope of finding ‘the good life’ by embracing simplicity
Once, young people in China were obsessed with emulating trendy lifestyles, attending parties, enjoying fine dining and treating consumption as a social currency.
But as this fast-paced lifestyle became the norm, many began to feel exhausted.
In response, a quieter, more traditional way of living has surfaced, and the young people have started calling themselves “old-school humans”.
Last December, some people began sharing stories on social media about spending time with their grandparents at local markets or dining with their parents at community canteens.
These moments of generational connection quickly gained attention, with many humorously adopting the “old-school human” label to describe their lifestyle, which feels out of sync with trendy things.

Court paves way for law requiring schools to display Ten Commandments in classrooms
Critics are arguing that it violates the separation of church and state
- Bookmark
An appeals court has cleared the path for a controversial Louisiana law mandating the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.
The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, voted 12-6 to overturn a previous injunction that had halted the law's implementation. In its opinion, released Friday, the court said it was premature to rule on the legislation's constitutionality.
The decision stems from a lack of clarity regarding how prominently the religious text would be displayed, whether teachers would reference the Ten Commandments during lessons, or if other historical documents, such as the Mayflower Compact or the Declaration of Independence, would also be exhibited, the majority opinion noted.
Without these specifics, the judicial panel concluded it lacked sufficient information to assess any potential First Amendment concerns arising from the law. The court said that more facts were required to "permit judicial judgment rather than speculation."
But the six judges who voted against the decision wrote a series of dissents, some arguing that the case was ripe for judicial review and others saying that the law exposes children to government-endorsed religion in a place they are required to be, presenting a clear constitutional burden.
Circuit Judge James L. Dennis wrote that the law "is precisely the kind of establishment the Framers anticipated and sought to prevent.”
The ruling comes after the full court heard arguments in the cases in January 2026 following a ruling by a three-judge panel of the court that Louisiana’s law was unconstitutional. Arkansas also has a similar law that has been challenged in federal court.
Texas’ law took effect on Sept. 1, marking the largest attempt in the nation to hang the Ten Commandments in public schools.
Multiple school districts were barred from posting them after federal judges issued injunctions in two cases against the law, but they have already gone up in many classrooms across the state as districts paid to have the posters printed themselves or accepted donations.
The laws are among the pushes by Republicans, including President Donald Trump, to incorporate religion into public school classrooms. Critics say it violates the separation of church and state while backers argue that the Ten Commandments are historical and part of the foundation of U.S. law.
The laws have been challenged by families representing a variety of religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, and clergy, in addition to nonreligious families.
In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The court found that the law had no secular purpose but served a plainly religious purpose.
And in 2005, the Supreme Court held that such displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds of the Texas state Capitol in Austin.

Matildas goalkeeper Teagan Micah has revealed she will miss the Asian Cup after suffering another concussion.
Micah will be replaced in the squad by Brisbane Roar keeper Chloe Lincoln, who has three Matildas caps to date.
What's next?
Micah's withdrawal cements Mackenzie Arnold as the Matildas goalkeeper ahead of the Asian Cup opener on March 1 against the Philippines in Perth.
Luckless goalkeeper Teagan Micah has been forced to withdraw from Australia's Women's Asian Cup squad after sustaining another concussion.
Micah has not played for club side Lyon in over a month after copping a head knock in training.
She was named in the Matildas squad on Thursday but Football Australia announced on Saturday that she would be replaced by Brisbane Roar No.1 Chloe Lincoln.
Micah has suffered her fair share of head knocks over her career and lost her status as Australia's first-choice 'keeper in the lead-up to the 2023 World Cup as she recovered from concussion.

"I am truly devastated to have to withdraw from the Asian Cup," Micah wrote on Instagram on Saturday.
"I recently sustained another concussion and although I have pushed my hardest to be back in time, I am simply just not ready.
"The timing feels absolutely cruel … and sometimes football and elite sports can break your heart and truly test you not just as a player but as a person.
"My priority is my health, my long term career and to get back to playing here in OL [Olympique Lyonnais]."
Micah's withdrawal will mean Mackenzie Arnold becomes coach Joe Montemurro's No.1 for the tournament, which kicks off on March 1 when Australia face the Philippines in Perth.
Lincoln has won just three caps and joins Arnold and the uncapped Jada Whyman in Montemurro's squad.
"Chloe has earned this opportunity through her hard work and professionalism," said Brisbane A-League Women coach Alex Smith.
"We're incredibly proud to see her receive national recognition and we know she'll represent both Brisbane Roar and Australia with pride."
Australia's squad will assemble in Perth next week ahead of their opening match.
They will also face Iran on the Gold Coast on March 5 and then meet South Korea in Sydney on March 8 in their two remaining group games.

Democratic governors demand refunds after Supreme Court tosses Trump tariffs

Governor JB Pritzker sent Donald Trump an invoice on Friday, February 20, demanding nearly $9 billion in tariff refunds for Illinois families after the US Supreme Court ruled the president's much-touted tariffs are illegal.
Pritzker urged the White House to "cut the check" after justices ruled 6-3 that Trump had exceeded his authority by invoking emergency powers to impose tariffs that reshaped global trade and pushed up prices at home.
"Your tariff taxes wreaked havoc on farmers, enraged our allies and sent grocery prices through the roof," the veteran Democrat wrote, warning that further legal action could follow if compensation was not forthcoming.
In the letter shared with US media, Pritzker demanded about $1,700 for every Illinois household – the amount Yale University experts said the average US household would pay on tariffs last year.
Pritzker wasn't alone in seeking payback – both political and literal – for widespread consumer woes.
'Time to pay the piper'
Earlier Friday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the money Trump's tariffs had raised came from US voters' pockets – and should be refunded.
"Time to pay the piper, Donald. These tariffs were nothing more than an illegal cash grab that drove up prices and hurt working families, so you could wreck longstanding alliances and extort them," he said. "Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately - with interest. Cough up!"
Pritzker and Newsom are widely seen as potential Democratic contenders in the 2028 presidential race. Their demands add a populist flourish to a complicated legal and economic reality. Announced with fanfare last April, Trump's tariffs have raised more than $130 billion from importers, with a significant proportion of that extra cost passed on to consumers through higher prices.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed skepticism that ordinary Americans will see direct compensation. The scale of potential repayments is vast. The influential Penn-Wharton Budget Model has estimated that refunds could total $175 billion, though it's unclear who would ultimately receive the money. Trump himself acknowledged that any refund process could take years.
In his dissent, Trump-appointed conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted Friday's ruling "says nothing today about whether, and if so how, the government should go about returning the billions of dollars that it has collected from importers."
New York's Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, called the Trump administration's tariffs "an unlawful backdoor tax on hardworking families, farmers and small businesses, raising prices on everything from groceries to building materials" – without demanding refunds.

Supreme Court ruling against Trump’s tariffs leaves Mexico in cautious wait-and-see mode

Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Mexico’s economy secretary urges caution after the Supreme Court voids President Trump’s tariff provisions, including fentanyl levies on Mexico, China and Canada.
- ‘I tell you to put yourselves in Zen mode. As tranquil as possible,’ said Marcelo Ebrard, the economy secretary.
- Ebrard plans to travel to the United States next week to seek clarity on what the decision means for the U.S. and Mexico.
MEXICO CITY — Mexico’s secretary of the economy, Marcelo Ebrard, urged “prudence” Friday in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling invalidating part of President Trump’s sweeping tariff regimen.
“We have to see where this is going,” Ebrard told reporters. “We have to see what measures [Washington] is going to take to figure out how it is going to affect our country. “
Amid widespread concern about tariffs in Mexico — the United States’ major commercial partner, with almost $1 trillion in annual two-way trade — Ebrard cautioned: “I tell you to put yourselves in zen mode. As tranquil as possible.”
Across the globe, nations were assessing how the high court’s ruling might affect them. Some world leaders expressed relief or satisfaction with Friday’s decision.
“The justices have shown that even a US president does not operate in a legal vacuum. Legal boundaries have been set, the era of unlimited, arbitrary tariffs may now be coming to an end,” Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament’s International Trade Committee, wrote on X.
Trump told reporters that his administration will impose new tariffs by using alternative legal means.
Also writing on X, Canada’s trade minister, Dominic LeBlanc, referred to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the Trump administration used to impose tariffs: “The United States Supreme Court’s decision reinforces Canada’s position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.”
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, when asked about the tariffs, said, “We’ll review the resolution carefully and then gladly give our opinion.”
Ebrard said he plans to travel to the United States next week to clarify matters.
Last year, Ebrard noted, Mexico managed to stave off Trump’s threats to impose a 25% across-the-board levy on all Mexican imports.
However, Mexico has been pushing back against Trump administration tariffs on imports of vehicles, steel and aluminum, among other products.
Among other impacts, the Supreme Court voided so-called fentanyl tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada. The Trump administration said it imposed those levies to force the three nations to crack down on trafficking of the deadly synthetic opioid.
The Supreme Court’s decision Friday to strike down the majority of tariffs imposed by President Trump could provide some relief to L.A.’s trade-reliant economy — but only if they are not reimposed again through other means.
In the aftermath of Friday’s ruling, Trump said he planned to seek alternative legal avenues to impose now-stricken tariffs.
About 85% of Mexican exports to the United States are exempt from tariffs because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. The accord extended a mostly free-trade regimen among the three nations, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The three-way pact is scheduled for joint review starting July 1. That date marks six years since the agreement was signed during the first Trump presidential term.

Israel has 'Biblical right' to take over all of Middle East, claims US envoy Huckabee

09:55:00 KST

In a high-stakes interview that has exposed a deep rift within the American Republican coalition, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has told commentator Tucker Carlson that Israel possesses a "Biblical right" to claim a vast swathe of land spanning the modern Middle East.
During the sit-down at Ben Gurion Airport on Wednesday, Carlson pressed the ambassador on the geographic boundaries of land grants described in Genesis 15, which include the territory from the Nile to the Euphrates.
When asked if Israel would have the right to take over the entire region based on this "original deed," Huckabee responded: "It would be fine if they took it all."
That an area that would include entire Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and parts of Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
"Israel is a land that God gave, through Abraham, to a people that he chose," Huckabee said, describing the Jewish people's connection to the land as a combination of "a people, a place, and a purpose."
While he later claimed that the Israeli government is not currently seeking to expand to those ancient borders, affirmation of Huckabee, a Baptist minister and an avowed Zionist, of the theological claim has triggered immediate international condemnation and reignited debates over the influence of Christian Zionism on US foreign policy.
Carlson interview of the US envoy stemmed from prior public disputes between the two over Israel's policies, particularly regarding Christians and US foreign policy.
Carlson has been accusing Huckabee of prioritising Israeli interests over American ones.
Carlson has previously interviewed both a Palestinian Christian and a Jordanian Christian, focusing on their experiences of harmonious co-existence within Muslim-majority societies.
These discussions also addressed the oppressive policies enacted during the Israeli military occupation.
Israeli leaders’ Latvia or Poland roots
The interview, which aired on Friday, quickly devolved into a heated exchange regarding the universal application of national rights.
Carlson, who has grown increasingly critical of unconditional US support for Israel, questioned why Huckabee defends the indigenous rights of Eastern European Jews while appearing more hesitant to affirm the same rights for the Irish or for Palestinian Christians whose families have lived in the Levant for two millennia.
"How do we know that Bibi [Netanyahu's] ancestors ever lived here?" Carlson asked, pointing out that many Israeli leaders have roots in Latvia or Poland.
"There are a lot of people in the territory that Israel controls today... who through genetic testing, we can know their families have been here for thousands of years. They have less of a right to the land than someone whose ancestors lived in Latvia?"
Huckabee dismissed the genetic argument, insisting that the "biblical, historical, and ethnic" connection creates a "very strong case" that is validated by archaeology.
"The stones cry out," the ambassador said, referencing the City of David excavations as proof of a 3,800-year continuous link.
Gaza genocide numbers
The conversation turned sharply toward the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israel has killed and wounded tens of thousands of Palestinians, wiped off all neighbourhoods and displaced almost entire 2.3 million residents in its genocide.
Huckabee falsely claimed that the Israel military have maintained a "lower proportion of civilians killed in urban warfare than in any urban conflict in modern history."
However, the ambassador struggled to provide concrete figures when pressed by Carlson.
After initially stating he did not know the exact death toll, Huckabee later suggested that if one accepted the Gaza Health Ministry's figures — which he estimated at roughly 60,000 — the ratio of militants to civilians killed would still be record-breaking for its "humanity."
"You just said they did a better job than the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan," Carlson countered.
"On what basis are you making the claim that the Israeli Army in Gaza spared more civilians than the US Army and Marine Corps?" Huckabee admitted he did not have the exact numbers on hand but maintained his position based on "conversations with people who fought there."
Huckabee defends Israel’s killing of children
Experts suggest the Gaza death toll of over 70,000 may be an undercount.
According to a new study published in The Lancet Global Health, more than 75,000 Palestinians were killed in the first 15 months of Israel's genocide in Gaza, a figure significantly higher than the 49,000 deaths announced at the time by local health officials.
The peer-reviewed research has found that women, children and the elderly accounted for 56.2 percent of violent deaths during that period, a proportion it said broadly aligns with reporting by Gaza's health ministry.
The study, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and led by Michael Spagat of Royal Holloway, University of London, surveyed 2,000 Palestinian households over seven days beginning on December 30, 2024.
"The combined evidence suggests that, as of January 5, 2025, 3–4 percent of the population of Gaza had been killed violently and there have been a substantial number of non-violent deaths caused indirectly by the conflict," the authors wrote.
During the interview, Huckabee defended Israel’s killing of children in Gaza, including 14-year-olds, suggesting some may have been complicit.
"If they participated in that then God help them."
The US envoy justified killings if individuals "supported Hamas" or "fought Israel," even if they were minors, while Carlson expressed bafflement and stated he would "never murder children."
" If these were your children being held hostage in Gaza, what would you do to get them out?" Huckabee asked Carlson, who replied, "I would not kill children, period. And I wouldn’t make excuses for killing children either."

Brisbane synagogue’s front gates rammed in suspected attack

Man charged after ute rams Brisbane Synagogue in ‘targeted attack’
Updated ,first published
A car has rammed into the gates of an inner-Brisbane synagogue on Friday night in what police called a targeted attack.
Shortly after 7pm on Friday, a Toyota Hilux utility was driven towards the Brisbane Synagogue on Margaret Street, narrowly missing a passerby and knocking down the building’s gates.
Acting Superintendent Michael Hogan said a 32-year-old Sunnybank man had been taken into custody within 90 minutes of the attack after tyre spikes were deployed and he was arrested outside the nearby Queensland Holocaust Museum.
“It was definitely a targeted attack against the Jewish synagogue,” Hogan said.
He said specialist counter-terrorism officers had been involved since the beginning of the investigation, but had ruled out the attack as an act of terrorism.
“I think what we need to keep in mind is there are a number of other contributing factors, including mental health and intoxication, that really need to be considered in this circumstance,” Hogan said.
The driver, Matt De Campo, was charged on Saturday with multiple offences, including committing serious vilification or a hate crime, driving dangerously, and possessing dangerous drugs.
Police claimed De Campo made anti-Semitic remarks during an interview, and he represented himself when appearing in court on Saturday.
Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies vice president Libby Burke said the representative body was deeply distressed by the incident.
“This attack is not only an attack on my community, it is an attack on all of us,” Burke said.
“A synagogue is a sacred space, a place of prayer, reflection and community.
“To see its gates viciously rammed is profoundly devastating and is not dissimilar to what we have seen throughout the globe – vehicles used as weapons to kill and harm Jews.”
Burke called for stronger legislation to protect Jewish Queenslanders, and said there had been a “meteoric rise” in antisemitism over the past two years.
“Hate-filled slogans and symbols create the environment in which violence becomes possible,” she said.
“There must be clear consequences for those who seek to intimidate, to threaten or harm our community.”
Dr Dvir Abramovich of the Anti-Defamation Commission said the attack was “intimidation on wheels”.
“We are told this is not being treated as terrorism. But when a synagogue is deliberately attacked, the label matters less than the impact,” he said.
CCTV footage of the incident showed a person behind the gates, but police said they did not think the individual was being targeted by the driver.
The footage, taken by surveillance on the synagogue, shows the utility slowing ahead of the gates, before reversing into the gates.
“I believe once you watch the video surveillance, it’s very clear that he’s intended to do some damage to the gates,” Hogan said.
“There’s certainly no indication ... that he attempted to enter the synagogue at all.”
Hogan said the 32-year-old was known to police and was arrested without incident after being followed by Polair.
“He’s used his own motor vehicle, which greatly assisted the police in identifying who the person was,” he said.
Officers suspected the driver acted alone, and said there was no ongoing threat to the community.
On Saturday, Premier David Crisafulli said he had spoken to police and leaders of Queensland’s Jewish community.
“This is another signal as to why we have put strong laws before parliament to protect all people where they worship,” he said.
“We are going through the process, and I fully intend to have them passed during the next sitting of parliament.”
Police urged anyone with relevant CCTV or dashcam footage of the incident to come forward.

Justice Department swiftly fires lawyer chosen as top federal prosecutor for Virginia office
A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump has been swiftly fired by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys
- Bookmark
A lawyer picked by judges to serve as the top federal prosecutor for a Virginia office that pursued cases against foes of President Donald Trump was swiftly fired Friday by the Justice Department in the latest clash over the appointments of powerful U.S. attorneys.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced the firing of James Hundley on social media shortly after he was unanimously chosen by judges to replace former Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. While the law says that the district court may choose U.S. attorneys when an initial appointment expires, the Trump administration has insisted that the power lies only in the hands of the executive branch.
“EDVA judges do not pick our US Attorney. POTUS does. James Hundley, you’re fired!” Blanche said in a post on X.
Hundley, who has handled criminal and civil cases for more than 30 years, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment Friday evening.
The firing of Hundley is the latest reflection of tumult in one of the Justice Department’s most elite prosecution offices, which since September has been mired in upheaval following the resignation of a veteran prosecutor amid Trump administration pressure to prosecute two of the president’s biggest political foes, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
That prosecutor, Erik Siebert, was effectively forced out and swiftly replaced by Halligan, a White House aide who secured indictments against Comey and James but was later deemed by a judge to have been unlawfully appointed. The cases were dismissed, but the Justice Department has appealed that decision.
Halligan resigned from the position last month after judges in the district signaled continued skepticism over the legitimacy of her appointment.
U.S. attorneys, the top federal prosecutors in regional Justice Department offices around the country, typically require Senate confirmation but the law does permit attorneys general to make temporary appointments for limited time periods. In several instances, though, the Justice Department has attempted to leave its temporary appointees in place in ways that have invited court challenges and drawn resistance from judges who have found the appointments unlawful.
Last week, a lawyer appointed by judges to be the U.S. attorney for northern New York was fired by the Justice Department after spending less than a day in the job. Judges in the district appointed Kinsella after declining to keep the Trump administration’s pick, John Sarcone, in place after his 120-day term elapsed.

As conditions in Roj camp deteriorate, Australia urged to accept citizens trapped in Syria

Conditions in the north-eastern Syrian camp where 34 Australians have been forcibly returned are deteriorating dramatically, with reports of near-nightly raids, and increasingly violent beatings, amid worsening uncertainty over their futures.
The 11 women and 23 Australian children forced back to Roj camp on Monday returned to find their tents – formerly huddled collectively in a row known as Australia Street – demolished and their possessions seized.
Kurdish officials have reportedly refused to return their tents, so the group has been scattered across the shrinking, unstable camp, billeted with other families.
There are no established lines of communications with the group, and their immediate future – whether another attempt will be made to reach Australia – is increasingly unclear.
The group – the last Australians left in the camp after previous government-run repatriations – are the wives, widows and children of slain or jailed Islamic State fighters.
They have been given Australian passports and permission to leave Roj camp.
But their efforts to reach Damascus, and from there board flights to Australia, were thwarted when Syrian government officials stopped their convoy, refusing them permission to cross into government-controlled territory. They were forced back to Roj, in Syria’s far north-east, near to the Turkish and Iraqi borders.
Sources on the ground in Syria say the camp is increasingly unstable and violent. It is expected to be transferred from Kurdish control into the hands of the Syrian government soon.
There are fears, too, for renewed violence amid the uncertainty of a fragile ceasefire between the Syrian government and the Kurdish forces, still in control of Roj camp for now, but who have ceded most of their territory.
‘We just want her home’
“It’s getting more dangerous, more uncertain,” a Syrian source said.
“Other countries are undertaking these repatriations. Australia has completely abdicated its responsibility.”
One mother said she had been actively avoiding the news, as any mention of the fate of the Australians who remained stranded in Syria was unbearable.
“It’s been almost seven years, we just want her home,” she said.
In Australia, human rights groups have urged Australia’s politicians to prioritise the rights of the Australian children to be repatriated to safety.
Sign up: AU Breaking News email
The government has been resolute that it is not assisting with the Australians’ repatriation, as it had previously with other Australians detained in the same camp.
The prime minister said he was inimical to their return.
“I have nothing but contempt for these people,” Anthony Albanese told ABC radio.
“The government is providing no support for the repatriation of these people or any support whatsoever.”
He had earlier said “you make your bed, you lie in it”. When it was pointed out most of the group were children, and that some had been born in the camps, he said: “I think it’s unfortunate that children are caught up in this, that’s not their decision, but it’s the decision of their parents or their mother.”
The chief executive of Save the Children Australia, which has advocated on behalf of the group over years, said all political parties should dial down the political rhetoric and put the wellbeing of vulnerable Australian children first.
“This is a group of innocent Australian children who deserve safety and protection, as every child does. That has largely been lost from the debate in recent days,” Mat Tinkler said.
“Every parent knows that babies and toddlers don’t make beds. The reality is that some of these children were born in the displacement camps, and many were toddlers when they were first taken there.
“These children would be sleeping in warm, comfortable beds at home in Australia by now if the government had repatriated them when it should have. They have lost years of their childhoods languishing in tents, in conditions that would shock most Australians.”
Tinkler said the government had always had the power to repatriate its citizens, as the Morrison and Albanese governments had done in 2019 and 2022, but that now, “politics is getting in the way of real solutions for these children”.
“Children are not responsible for the actions of their parents, and their rights must not be swept aside because it is politically convenient to do so.
“Leaving them in limbo will not make the Australian community any safer. In fact, national security experts say it may present a greater long-term risk.”
‘The conditions in the camps are dire’
Human Rights Watch said that Roj camp, while it remains in the hands of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, is expected to be handed over to the Syrian government soon.
“Conditions there seem to have deteriorated in the last weeks, with women we are in touch with reporting near nightly raids and beatings of a scale and severity not previously felt.”
The Australia director of Human Rights Watch, Daniela Gavshon, said the organisation had repeatedly pressed the Australian and other governments to repatriate their citizens who had been unlawfully and indefinitely detained in north-east Syria for almost seven years.
“The conditions in the camps are dire. The situation is untenable and the government needs to find a solution. These Australians should be brought back to Australia for rehabilitation, reintegration, and prosecution of adults where warranted.”
Gavshon said Australia was well equipped to reintegrate the women and children from the camps, with services to support those who had experienced displacement, violence, family separation and interrupted schooling.
“For years now, experts have been saying, the greatest danger for Australia is not accepting the return of children from the camps in north-east Syria. It’s leaving them there.”
The Australian government has said it will seek to impose a temporary exclusion order on one of the women understood to be seeking to return to Australia.
The Australian government undertook two successful repatriation missions – of eight orphaned children in 2019, and of four women and 13 children in 2022 – but said consistently it had no plan to repatriate the final group. One returned woman was charged with entering a proscribed area, Raqqah province. Mariam Raad pleaded guilty and was discharged conditionally in a NSW court.
Last October, two women and four children escaped nearby al-Hawl detention camp, making their way across Syria to Lebanon, where they were given passports at the Australian embassy. They returned to Australia on a commercial flight.
In 2024, Clare O’Neil, then home affairs minister, was preparing to bring a plan to repatriate the remaining Australians to cabinet for approval. But there were concerns within government over backlash to any repatriation from community groups in electorally critical marginal seats in western Sydney, and the plan was abandoned.
The US funds the bulk of security operations across north-east Syria through the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. It wants the camp closed and has withdrawn funding and pushed allies to repatriate their citizens.
Islamic State “continues to seek to indoctrinate residents and to infiltrate the detention facilities” at Roj, the US says.
The commander of US Central Command, Adm Brad Cooper, told a UN conference in September “as time goes on, these camps are incubators for radicalisation”.

PacifiCorp to pay $575M to resolve federal government's claims over wildfires in Oregon, California
PacifiCorp has agreed to pay $575 million to resolve the federal government's claims for damages stemming from six wildfires in Oregon and California
- Bookmark
PacifiCorp has agreed to pay $575 million to resolve the federal government's claims for damages stemming from six wildfires in Oregon and California in 2020 and 2022, federal officials announced Friday, in the utility's latest multimillion-dollar payout related to the deadly blazes.
The settlement resolves the federal government's claims that PacifiCorp's electrical lines negligently started four fires in Oregon in 2020 and two fires in California in 2020 and 2022, the Justice Department said. The money will help restore some of the 290,000 acres (117,359 hectares) of public land that burned. It will also help repay the government for the cost of fighting the fires, which the department said was “critical because the U.S. Forest Service now spends more than half of its budget on wildfire suppression annually."
“This settlement served the Department’s longstanding policy of holding individuals and corporations responsible for damages caused by wildfires. Every fire impacting federal lands, no matter the size, is a priority,” U.S. Attorney Eric Grant of the Eastern District of California said in a statement.
PacifiCorp said the settlement demonstrates its ongoing commitment to resolve claims related to the fires. It has so far settled claims totaling over $2 billion, according to its statement.
The utility has faced a series of lawsuits over the 2020 blazes in Oregon. In other cases that have gone to trial in the state, juries in multiple verdicts have ordered PacifiCorp to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to victims.
In 2023, an Oregon jury found PacifiCorp liable for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from top fire officials. The jury determined it acted negligently and willfully and should have to pay punitive and other damages — a decision that applied to a class of property owners. More than a thousand class members have cases set for trial in 2026 and 2027.
PacifiCorp’s appeal of the case is still making its way through state court.
The 2020 Labor Day weekend fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon’s history. They killed 11 people, burned more than a million acres (404,686 hectares) and destroyed thousands of homes.
In California, the 2020 Slater Fire and 2022 McKinney Fire also claimed several lives.
Earlier this week, PacifiCorp announced that it will sell its wind, natural gas generation and distribution assets and infrastructure in the state of Washington to Portland General Electric Company for $1.9 billion to help stabilize its finances. Even though it is appealing wildfire judgments against it, PacifiCorp has had to post bonds with the court, which has put a crunch on its cash flow.
Darin Carroll, PacifiCorp’s CEO, said Tuesday the move would “improve the company’s financial stability while simplifying our operations” and help ensure reliable service for customers in Washington.
The utility’s parent company, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, is sitting on more than $382 billion cash, but the conglomerate expects PacifiCorp to take care if its own obligations. The executive who led Berkshire’s utility unit for years, Greg Abel, is now Berkshire’s CEO.

Bad Bunny positioned to consolidate his popularity in Brazil with first-ever performances
Bad Bunny’s huge global rise is finally breaking through in Brazil, a market that overwhelmingly favors national artists
- Bookmark
While Bad Bunny has dominated global charts, the superstar has not had quite the same success in Brazil, a country notoriously hard for foreign stars to win over due to a devotion to national artists.
But a shift that began with his Grammy-winning album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” may accelerate further after his first-ever gigs in Brazil on Friday and Saturday in Sao Paulo.
Bad Bunny has come to Brazil at the peak of his career so far, following the phenomenal hype around his performance at the Super Bowl halftime show.
“It’s the best time to try and unlock a country like Brazil, at a time when he’s managed to dominate practically the entire world,” said Felipe Maia, an ethnomusicologist who is pursuing a doctoral degree on popular music and digital technologies at Paris Nanterre University.
For years, the Puerto Rican artist born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio has been one of the most-streamed artists on the planet.
But neither the singer, nor his album, nor his songs were among the most played last year in Brazil, according to Spotify. The most streamed artists in the country on the platform in 2025 were all Brazilian.
In the land of samba, funk, bossa nova, choro, sertanejo, forro and pagode, among other Brazilian music genres, 75% of streaming consumption in Brazil focuses on national artists, according to the 2025 midyear music report of Luminate, a company specializing in entertainment industry data. Brazil is the country that most listens to its own music, it said.
Sold-out shows
Still, particularly since “Debí Tirar Más Fotos," the fever around Bad Bunny has made headway in Brazil. Only one performance was initially scheduled at the Allianz Parque arena, but it sold out so quickly the artist added an extra date, which also sold out.
By mid-afternoon on Friday, long queues had formed. Brazilian fans mixed with people from El Salvador, Colombia and Venezuela. Many came wearing straw hats — used by Bad Bunny and traditionally worn by jíbaros, rural Puerto Rican farmers.
Tickets on Ticketmaster, the official vendor, ranged from $50 to $210, but resellers on Friday were selling tickets for that same night for more than $830 — more than 2.5 times the minimum monthly wage in Brazil.
Flávia Durante, a Sao Paulo -based DJ who specializes in Latin American music, said that some Brazilians have a tendency to see Spanish-language music as corny due to the association with Mexican telenovelas, but that Bad Bunny pierced a bubble with his latest album.
“Nowadays everyone knows all the songs, they sing along and really get into it. I normally play him at the peak of the night. People request him, even at rock or 80s pop themed parties,” Durante said.
Since the half-time Super Bowl show, that popularity has grown. Bad Bunny’s average streams grew by 426% on Spotify in Brazil in the following week compared with the previous one. Many songs experienced massive streaming surges, with “Yo Perreo Sola” leading the growth with a 2,536% increase.
‘Latino resistance’
During Brazil’s Carnival celebrations, Bad Bunny themed costumes were a fixture in Rio’s raucous, dazzling street parties.
Nicole Froio, a Colombian Brazilian writer specializing in Latin American cultural issues, went kitted out in a straw hat and plastic, tropical plants that echo the background of his latest album. It was the third Carnival in which Froio — who has two Bad Bunny tattoos and a third one planned — wore attire that evoked the Puerto Rican artist.
For a long time, Froio was the sole person among her Brazilian friendship group who liked Bad Bunny. She believes that Brazilians in general have trouble identifying themselves as Latino.
“There’s a lot of prejudice around Hispanic music and there were preconceptions against him because of his Puerto Rican accent, because people don’t understand him,” she said.
Brazil’s Latino identity exists but it is diffuse and difficult to seize due to the variety within the continent-sized country, said Maia. But Bad Bunny succeeds in giving it emphasis, particularly in cosmopolitan cities such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, he said.
Brazil, like other countries in the Americas, was listed by Bad Bunny in the Super Bowl halftime show, when he reminded the world that while “America” is used as a synonym for the U.S. in the U.S., it is the name used across two continents.
Bad Bunny’s global success, including in Brazil, “reinforces that we’re part of this — that we belong,” said 22-year-old Diogo da Luz, a longtime fan of the Puerto Rican ahead of Friday's concert. “He reinforces that we are one people and that we’re very united.”
For Froio, who has been waiting to see him live for six years and will see him on Saturday, Bad Bunny “represents a Latino resistance.”
She pointed to the fact that other Latin American superstars, including Anitta, Shakira, and Ricky Martin, have recorded full songs in other languages, while Bad Bunny has kept his music almost entirely in Spanish.
“For me, there’s a great authenticity in his sound that inspires me to be who I am and let everyone else deal with it,” Froio said.

NORAD intercepts 5 Russian aircraft near Alaska, though military says there was no threat
NORAD intercepted five Russian military aircraft near Alaska’s western coast, but officials say the flights were not provocative

Military jets were launched to intercept five Russian aircraft that were flying in international airspace off Alaska’s western coast, but military officials said Friday the Russian aircraft were not seen as provocative.
The North American Aerospace Defense Command said it detected and tracked two Russian Tu-95s, two Su-35s and one A-50 operating near the Bering Strait on Thursday.
In response, NORAD launched two F-16s, two F-35s, one E-3 and four KC-135 refueling tankers to intercept, identify and escort the Russian aircraft until they departed the area, according to a release from the command.
“The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter American or Canadian sovereign airspace,” according to the NORAD statement. It also noted this kind of activity “occurs regularly and is not seen as a threat.”
The Russian aircraft were operating in an area near the Bering Strait, a narrow body of water about 50 miles (80 kilometers) wide separating the Pacific and Arctic oceans, called the Alaskan Air Defense Identification Zone.
Such zones begin where sovereign airspace ends. While it’s international airspace, all aircraft are required to identify themselves when entering zones in the interest of national security, NORAD said.
The command used satellites, ground and airborne radars and aircraft to detect and track aircraft
NORAD is headquartered at Peterson Space Force Base, Colorado, but has its Alaska operations based at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage.

Jersey Shore star reveals cervical cancer diagnosis
Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi says she is likely to have a hysterectomy
- Bookmark
Reality TV personality Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi has revealed she has been diagnosed with stage one cervical cancer.
The former star of MTV's Jersey Shore shared the news in a TikTok video on Friday, explaining that a biopsy had confirmed the diagnosis.
Speaking from her car between medical appointments, Polizzi expressed a mix of emotions.
“Obviously not the news that I was hoping for,” she said, “but also not the worst news, just because they caught it so early, thank freaking God.”
She used the opportunity to encourage her followers to undergo regular Pap smears, which can detect abnormal cells in the cervix before they become cancerous.
She added that she anticipates needing a hysterectomy following a PET scan, which will determine whether the cancer has spread further.
“I’m 38 years old and I’ve been struggling with abnormal Pap smears for three or four years now, and now look at me,” she said.
“Instead of putting it off because I didn’t want to go, because I was hurt and scared, I just went and did it. And it was there, cancer is in there but it’s Stage 1 and it’s curable.”
She remarked that “2026 is not panning out how I wanted it to”.
However, she added: “But also, it could be worse.”
Polizzi, 38, rose to fame with the debut of Jersey Shore in 2009, appearing in six seasons and subsequent spin-offs like Snooki & JWoww and Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.
She still lives in New Jersey with her husband of 11 years and their three children.
A diagnosis of stage one cervical cancer means that the cancer is within the neck of the womb (cervix) and has not spread to nearby tissues or other organs, according to Cancer Research UK.
The main treatments are surgery and combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Killing of nationalist student leaves French far left in deep trouble as elections loom

Killing of nationalist student leaves French far left in deep trouble as elections loom
Is the far left about to replace the far right as the pariah of French politics?
The question is inescapable following the killing in Lyon of nationalist student Quentin Deranque by suspected far-left militants.
Deranque was killed on 12 February after a small university protest by far-right feminists, who he was supposed to be protecting.
Mobile phone footage shows him being repeatedly kicked and punched on the ground by masked and hooded young men. He died of head injuries.
Since then a torrent of condemnation has come down on the main party on the radical left, La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), which has a bloc of some 70 MPs in the 577-member National Assembly - and on its leader, veteran firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
On Saturday afternoon about 3,000 people held a rally in memory of Quentin Deranque at the place in Lyon where he was attacked. Security was tight and police kept opponents well away.
Those attending were from an assortment of small traditionalist, Catholic, nationalist and neo-fascist groups. Significantly the populist right National Rally - France's biggest party - kept away.
The seven suspects now charged in connection with the killing were all members of, or close to, an organisation called La Jeune Garde (The Young Guard) which used to provide security for LFI before it was banned last year.
One of the suspects – Jacques-Elie Favrot – was the salaried parliamentary assistant of an LFI deputy, Raphaël Arnault, who set up The Young Guard in 2018.
Favrot has been charged with "complicity to murder by instigation", not with delivering the blows that killed Deranque.
But Adrian Besseyre – who according to his lawyer also worked in Arnault's team at the National Assembly – is one of those charged with murder.
All the suspects deny any intention to kill, according to the investigating magistrate. Two refused to talk, he said, while the others admitted being at the scene, and some admitted inflicting blows.
For the past 50 years it was a constant accepted by most of the French political establishment that the party to be ostracised for its links to extremism lay at the other end of the political spectrum: the National Front, and its successor the National Rally (RN).
What has happened in the last 10 days could be turning that nostrum on its head – completing the "de-demonisation" of the RN so fervently pursued by its leader Marine Le Pen, and making new "demons" out of the radical left.
From diametrically opposing points of view, the RN and LFI both reject the consensus that has governed France for the last 50 years.
With its nationalist traditions, the RN promotes the interests of French citizens over immigrants, and takes a tough line on crime which it links with some immigrant communities. True to its Marxist roots, LFI defends a working class which it sees as now being mainly of immigrant origin.
On economic matters the two parties are not a million miles apart. But on touchstone "identity" issues, there is mutual hatred.
On Gaza, LFI refused to condemn the deadly Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, while RN – for all its antisemitic past – sides increasingly with Israel.
If the untouchable stain shifts from one to the other - from far right to far left – the implications for the future of France could be profound.
Until now the far right has been kept at bay by a cordon sanitaire applied by the rest of the parties.
The RN may be the most popular party in the country, but it finds it hard to win elections because opponents make arrangements among themselves to ensure the anti-RN vote is united.
A classic example was at the last legislative elections in 2024, called following President Emmanuel Macron's sudden dissolution of the Assembly.
The RN was expected to sweep the board and did well in the first round of voting.
But in the decisive second round, Macronite and left-wing candidates stood aside in order to concentrate the anti-RN vote. The result was a resurgence of the left and centre, with the RN winning only 120 or so seats – and no majority for anyone.
But this machination was only possible because other parties were willing to deal with Mélenchon's LFI – a party which, unlike the RN, was considered part of the "Republican arc", in other words acceptable.
But what if that is about to change because of the murder of Quentin Deranque and the implication of young men with links to LFI?
What if the Socialists with their 70 or so MPs, and the centrists with about 160, refuse now to cut any kind of deal with LFI? Suddenly the blocking majority against the far right begins to collapse.
But there's more. What if the mark of shame shifts so completely to the far left that the far right becomes clean by comparison?
Then the conservative Republicans – with about 50 seats in parliament – start openly dealing with the RN. And the far right is at the portal of the mainstream.
All this could already have important repercussions in the municipal elections which take place next month across France.
How much more significant it will be when voters come to choose who rules the country – at the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2027.
Writing in the conservative Le Figaro newspaper, commentator Guillaume Tabard put it succinctly: "Since Quentin Deranque's death, the political landscape has shifted.
"Mélenchon's party has become the formation that is the most condemned in politics and the media. For [the RN] it is a godsend, after half a century in which the distinction belonged to it."
Circumstances have certainly played hugely into the far right's hands.
Le Pen and party president Jordan Bardella are accustomed to accusations targeting the RN's own links with disreputable "security" organisations or electoral candidates with unacceptable pasts.
Now they need barely to open their mouths. The rest of the political class is doing their work for them, as centrists, conservatives and moderate left-wingers alike join the anti-LFI campaign.
The process of ostracism is all the more ineluctable because LFI itself has clearly decided that the worst policy would be to show remorse.
Naturally they condemn the killing, but Mélenchon refuses to condemn The Young Guard or to suspend its founder Raphaël Arnault as an MP.
For France's mainstream left, it is all deeply disconcerting. They are caught between the need to distance themselves from LFI and the ingrained instinct not to give succour to the far right.
It is a hopeless situation, and their only recourse is to keep reminding voters that the RN has its own history of ambivalence towards violent extremism.
"By focusing all our attacks on the LFI, we are creating a corridor of respectability for the RN," lamented the former prime minister and possible 2027 presidential candidate Dominique de Villepin, a conservative in the past but now shifting to the left.
"We are offering the RN what it has always dreamed of: the appearance of normality."

Turkey, Saudi sign major solar power deal
Saudi Arabia will help Turkey build solar plants capable of powering more than two million homes, under a deal the two countries signed Friday that aims to deepen energy cooperation between the key regional players.
The signing ceremony at an Ottoman-era palace by the waters of the Bosphorus Strait in Istanbul followed a $2-billion inter-governmental energy agreement between the two countries during a landmark visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Riyadh on 3 February.
Turkey is preparing to host the United Nations' COP31 climate summit on its Mediterranean coast later this year, with Australia leading the negotiations.
Ties between Turkey and Saudi Arabia have steadily improved in recent years after collapsing in the wake of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.
The two countries now cooperate on a range of diplomatic issues, including support for Gaza and backing Syria's new government following the ouster of president Bashar al-Assad in 2024.
Under the agreement, Saudi firm Acwa will build two solar power plants in the provinces of Sivas and Karaman in central Turkey, with a combined capacity of 2,000 megawatts - enough to meet the electricity needs of 2.1 million households, officials said.
Turkish energy minister Alparslan Bayraktar hailed the project as "one of the largest domestic and foreign investments ever made in our energy sector", and said Turkey "will also secure electricity procurement at the lowest price ever achieved in our country".
Turkey is undergoing an energy "revolution", he said, adding that 62 percent of installed electricity capacity last year came from renewable sources.
"We have increased our installed capacity in solar and wind energy from almost zero to over 40,000 megawatts today. We consistently emphasise that our country has much greater potential in renewable energy," he told a ceremony.
By 2035, Turkey aims at increasing its installed capacity in solar and wind to 120,000 megawatts.
Ankara is also targeting net zero emissions by 2053, but 33.6 percent of its electricity came from coal last year, according to official ministry data.
In response to an AFP question about Turkey's dependence on coal, Bayraktar said Turkey aims at cheaper energy and reducing reliance on energy imports.
"Coal can initially be replaced with gas, but in the medium and long term it can be substituted with nuclear" power plants, he said.

Hong Kong budget 2026-27: ‘sweeteners’ for grass roots or the middle class?
Debate grows in the wake of finance chief’s projection that city will achieve early operating account surplus after three-year deficit
Hong Kong’s improving fiscal position has prompted a groundswell of calls for the government to offer more “sweeteners” in the coming budget, including a cross-party demand for more tax relief for the middle class, but economists have cautioned against such across-the-board measures.
They were more supportive of targeted spending, a cause taken up in recent weeks by concern groups asking for more specific forms of help for grass-roots residents, especially the unemployed.
The growing debate was sparked by Hong Kong finance chief Paul Chan Mo-po’s disclosure last August that the city was set to achieve an early operating account surplus after three consecutive years of deficit.
In February, Chan said that a stock market boom had helped the government’s operating account return to surplus in the 2025-2026 financial year – a year earlier than projected.
The surplus could reach about HK$500 million (US$64 million), according to estimates by some accounting firms.
The government rolled out one-off support measures totalling HK$8.3 billion last year, a 28 per cent year-on-year reduction from HK$11.5 billion in 2024 and an 86 per cent drop from HK$59.4 billion in 2023.
With the improved public finances, there has been a growing chorus for more sweeteners in this year’s budget.

What’s next after US Supreme Court ruling on Trump’s tariffs?
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - The US Supreme Court’s striking down of US President Donald Trump’s global tariffs
What comes next after the conservative-majority court’s decision?
Long road to refunds
The ruling sets up a long fight for tariff refunds, as the duties, now deemed illegal, generated some US$133.5 billion (S$169 billion) from January 2025 to mid-December.
The top court did not address the refunds issue, and analysts say this will be decided by lower courts in the coming months.
The US Court of International Trade is expected to manage this process, said ING analysts Carsten Brzeski and Julian Geib.
“Refunds won’t come automatically, as any importer that wants its money back must sue individually,” they said. “This process has already kicked off, with over 1,000 corporate entities now involved in a legal fight.”
Mr Trump told reporters on Feb 20: “We’ll end up being in court for the next five years.”
More volatility
Hours after the court decision, Mr Trump vowed to impose a new 10 per cent tariff on imports
This is widely seen as a temporary move to pave the way for more durable tariffs, but is set to trigger other challenges and upheaval in the meantime.
The law Mr Trump is tapping for this tariff – Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – only allows for a duty of 150 days unless Congress extends it.
Mr Trump has said there will be new investigations of unfair trade practices under Section 301, a path towards more lasting duties.
Mr Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, said the Feb 20 ruling merely “opens a new chapter” in Mr Trump’s tariff policy.
There will be “more uncertainty, more volatility for businesses to navigate, and more fraught trade deals for countries to negotiate,” Mr Lipsky added.
Losing speed
But for now, the court’s decision “removes one of Trump’s fastest tools for imposing broad tariffs,” said ING.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News on Feb 20 that tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) “were custom made for President Trump to assert leverage” against other countries.
“We were able to bring them to the table very quickly,” he said.
“We will get back to the same tariff level for the countries,” Mr Bessent vowed. “It will just be in a less direct and slightly more convoluted manner.”
Trade deal uncertainty?
With tariffs imposed via emergency economic powers forming the basis of recent trade talks, analysts warned that some partners may try to rethink their commitments.
Mr Lipsky expects economies that have already made deals to keep them rather than “risk unravelling an agreement which at least has provided some stability”.
But those still finalising deals may have more leverage now.
Asia Society Policy Institute senior vice-president Wendy Cutler expects that walking away from announced deals “does not seem to be in the cards for our partners”.
“They know all too well that such a step could end up leaving them in a worse position with the White House,” she said.
Lower tariffs?
With the Supreme Court ruling, consumers “face an overall average effective tariff rate of 9.1 per cent, which remains the highest since 1946 excluding 2025,” according to The Budget Lab at Yale University.
This is down from 16.9 per cent.
Despite Mr Trump’s plan to move towards more lasting duties, Navy Federal Credit Union chief economist Heather Long expects that the Feb 20 ruling “will force a reset in tariff policy”.
She anticipates this is “likely to lead to lower overall tariff rates and a more orderly imposition of future tariffs.” AFP

Trump FCC chair at center of Colbert and Kimmel controversies urges networks broadcast ‘patriotic, pro-America’ content
Brendan Carr suggested networks start each broadcast with the Pledge of Allegiance
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has urged networks to broadcast “patriotic, pro-America” content for the country’s 250th birthday.
Many Americans may not have known who the FCC chair is if not for recent controversies between the Trump administration and late-night television hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert. Carr and the administration as a whole have been accused of stomping on First Amendment rights by trying to influence what broadcasters air.
Now, Carr has asked broadcasters to join the Pledge America Campaign, in which they would air “patriotic, pro-America content that celebrates the American journey and inspires its citizens by highlighting the historic accomplishments of this great nation from our founding through the Trump Administration today,” according to a Friday statement.
This upcoming July 4 will mark 250 years of American independence and the White House has created its own task force to plan festivities.
Carr has suggested broadcasters air programming geared toward this “non-partisan celebration” and gave examples, including running specials about American history, starting each broadcast day with the Pledge of Allegiance, or airing music by “America’s greatest composers.” Such artists listed in the statement were John Philip Sousa, Aaron Copland, Duke Ellington, and George Gershwin.
“I am calling on broadcasters to pledge to provide programming that promotes civic education, national pride, and our shared history. This type of programming is more relevant than ever, as surveys show that civics education is in rapid decline. And classic programming such as Schoolhouse Rock! is now only found in online archives.
“Broadcasters are uniquely positioned to help address these concerning developments by providing programming that celebrates the remarkable story of American Independence while also tailoring it to the specific needs of their local communities, in furtherance of their public interest obligations,” Carr said.
Anna Gomez, the only Democratic FCC Commissioner, rebuked Carr’s Pledge America Campaign, writing on X, “Nothing is more American than defending our constitutional rights against those who would erode our civil liberties.
“If broadcasters choose to participate in this FCC campaign, they can do so by defending their First Amendment rights and refusing government interference.”
In September, ABC decided to briefly suspend Kimmel’s late-night show after comments he made about the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ABC’s decision came after Carr pressured the network to “take action” against Kimmel for his comments.
Upon his show’s return, Kimmel called out Carr, mentioning a 2022 social media post from the FCC official that read, “Political satire is one of the oldest and most important forms of free speech.”
Colbert recently took a jab at Carr after the comedian this week claimed CBS lawyers blocked him from broadcasting an interview with James Talarico, a Democrat running for U.S. Senate in Texas, on The Late Show.
The FFC has a rule requiring broadcasters to offer equal time to each political candidate in a race. It has long been understood that talk shows are exempt from the rule, but the communications agency warned in January not all late-night and daytime programs are exempt.
“Carr said he was thinking about dropping the exception for talk shows because he said that some of them were motivated by partisan purposes,” Colbert said on his show Monday. “Well, sir, you’re chairman of the FCC. So FCC you. Because I think you are motivated by partisan purposes yourself.”
CBS has denied that it blocked The Late Show from broadcasting the Talarico interview, saying “The show was provided legal guidance that the broadcast could trigger the FCC equal-time rule for two other candidates.”
The FCC rules built for broadcast don't apply to digital platforms and the video of the interview has since been watched on The Late Show’s YouTube platform more than 8.3 million times.
In a Fox News interview Wednesday, Carr defended his agency, telling host Laura Ingraham, “The days that these legacy media broadcasters get to decide what we can say, what we can think, who we can vote for, are over. I think President Trump played a key role in just smashing the facade that they still get to decide the narrative.”

The dirty little secret economists never want to mention

Why economists hate low unemployment for inflation
Bad news, they reckon, always comes in threes.
There was the big spike in inflation in recent months with the rate rising to an uncomfortable 3.8 per cent.
What followed was an interest rate hike a fortnight ago. And then this week, even worse news. Unemployment was stuck at levels many considered to be way too low.
A jobless rate at 4.1 per cent almost certainly puts pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).
It's a level that confirms the economy is running hot, justifies its most recent rate hike and, even worse, raises the chance of another rate rise in May, according to most economists.
Hang on a sec. Take a step back and just consider the broader implications of that line of thought.
Are we really saying there are too many people with a job? That we need more people on the dole queue so the rest of us feel comfortable?
Oddly, there are very few amongst us willing to take one for the team; to live in poverty and sacrifice their family so everyone else can pay a lower mortgage rate.
A bit of a reminder here.
The RBA has two mandates, two targets for which it must aim. For the past 66 years, it has been obligated to keep prices in check and to maintain full employment.
So, running an economy that has historically low levels of unemployment after an unprecedented series of interest rate hikes in the past few years, was not just unexpected, it's unheard of.
The textbooks would tell you that a punishing series of rate hikes should slow the economy and force businesses to lay off workers as they look to cut costs.
Incredibly, the economy slowed but the jobs remained, partly due to elevated government spending, particularly in the healthcare and aged care sectors.
For the past year, there's been an obsession about artificial intelligence and the potential impact on the job market. So far, it hasn't dented employment numbers.
But that could change quickly.
What happens when the theory no longer works?
Many of our big-name economic commentators don't deviate too far from the headline numbers whenever there's a new data drop.
Instead, they obsess about an oft talked about, but mysterious concept called the NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.
The theory goes that, if you have just the right amount of workers on the unemployment scrap heap, you can keep inflation in check.
The problem is that no-one knows exactly what the magic unemployment rate is. Even more confusing, it seems to change and, on occasions, such as the past few years, not hold true at all.
LoadingBut just before the pandemic, that changed, as the jobless rate dropped into the 4s and then, later on, into the 3s.
What economists and especially central bankers like our Reserve Bank of Australia are loath to admit, however, is that they deliberately attempt to engineer a situation where a certain percentage of workers are out of a job.
It's a concept worth remembering when the tabloids go on their regular rampage against "dole bludgers" and welfare cheats.
Once upon a time, the RBA considered full employment to be exactly that. The goal was to have everyone who wanted a job to be gainfully employed.
Not any longer.
Is the jobs market as tight as the figures suggest?
At just 4.1 per cent, our unemployment rate is low by historical measures, at least for the past 50 years.
Its strength throughout the inflation surge three years ago when interest rates rose 13 times in succession may have been baffling. But it was welcome because it helped us avoid a recession and a potential banking crisis.
As tough as living conditions were, with price rises far outstripping wage gains, most Australians avoided defaulting on bank loans because they were still bringing in an income.
But there are signs the growth in jobs is slowing, as this graph from investment bank Jarden shows.
Just 17,800 jobs were created in February, according to the latest statistics, below the 20,000 expected.
The percentage of the workforce actively looking for a job, what is known as the participation rate, has dropped back from last year's record levels, possibly because of the slowdown in population growth as immigration numbers have reduced.
Had the participation rate stayed at those record levels, the unemployment rate would have been higher.
During the peak immigration flows 18 months ago, we needed to create around 40,000 jobs a month just to keep the unemployment rate steady.
In the past 25 years, there's been a huge increase in the public sector workforce as governments have prioritised education, meeting the needs of an ageing population and catering for the disabled.
Once steady around 22 per cent, the public sector now accounts for around 29 per cent of the workforce.
But it may well have peaked. The growth in NDIS-related jobs has now stabilised, according to Jarden's research.
And it now sees a potential slowdown in private sector employment as interest rates begin to bite.

In the army now: Pictures that show how ordinary Ukrainians have been shaped by war

Civilians to soldiers: how four years of war has changed ordinary Ukrainians
The Russian bombs that began falling on Ukraine on 24 February 2022 turned tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians into soldiers overnight.
Many who had never held a weapon before rushed to take up arms. In the four years that have followed, as the war has ground on and the initial patriotic fervour has died down, thousands more have been conscripted. For men, service is open-ended and applies to those aged 25-65. Women can serve on a contractual basis.
Speaking from mud-soaked dugouts, drone command centres, frontline observation posts and rehabilitation centres, seven Ukrainian soldiers have told the BBC about the civilians they once were, the soldiers they have become – and the toll the war has taken on them.
Olena, 26: 'My place is here as long as the enemy is in my house'
Not long ago, Olena worked as a nightclub administrator in Prague. "It felt like everything was ahead of me - and there was plenty of time," she says. Then, she realised if she didn't protect her future, she would remain stuck in the past.
In December 2024, she returned to Ukraine, joined the army and became a pilot.
"I look at the 'before' photo and see myself calmer," Olena says. "More naive. Everything became different. I became different."
"My 'past' life was filled with a constant chase: to make it in time, to achieve, to build, to earn, to prove. Now, everything is simpler: what matters is that my brothers-in-arms are alive after enemy strikes."
The difficult moments, Olena says, are not the explosions or the danger: "Sometimes the hardest thing is the silence after the news of losses."
She finds strength in thinking of her family, away from the front lines, who "survive a week without light and heating, but don't lose the hope for a better future".
While the fighting continues, she can't imagine another life: "My place is here as long as the enemy is in my house."
Oleh, 37: 'I am not a military man, I have never seen myself like that'
Like the majority of Ukrainians, on 24 February 2022 Oleh was "confused, and scared".
Some ran towards the borders; others, to the enlistment offices. "I froze, trying to master my fear," says Oleh, a publishing graduate and former NGO worker. "I am not a military man, I have never seen myself like that, and I did not understand how ordinary people could stand in the way of such a powerful enemy like Russia."
But the next month, Oleh - who loved role-playing board games and wrote fiction - joined the army.
As a soldier, he says, "you are constantly in a small room in your head, the space of which is getting smaller every time. Outside the window, others are living… while there is no handle on the door on your side to get out."
The war has jolted him. "Before, it was important for me to help others find their way, to become strong, self-confident. Now I understand that the technique of positive thinking does not save you from armed thugs."
Getting rid of them, Oleh says, is a way of helping not with words but deeds.
"You can't save everyone. But even your unsuccessful attempts will matter."
Anastasiia, 19: 'Before, I didn't have a clear concept of values in life'
When she finished school, Anastasia didn't know what she wanted to be, so she took up a job as a barista. Then she became fascinated by drones - the nimble, deadly aircraft that have become centrepieces of the war in Ukraine - and in March 2025 joined the army.
"I first held the position of unmanned systems duty officer, and then became an FPV (first person view) operator," she says. Since then, she has found that being a woman in the armed forces "was and still is the most difficult thing".
"You constantly have to prove you are worthy of doing the job, and on an equal footing with others."
In the 11 months since signing up, Anastasia says she has learned about happiness. "Time with loved ones, love, delicious food," she lists. "Being close to your family. Not being afraid that you won't wake up tomorrow."
"Before, I didn't have a clear concept of values in this life due to my age," she says. "Now, I feel completely different."
Roman, 42: 'I try not to think about the future'
Before the full-scale invasion started, Roman was one of Ukraine's top bio-engineers, trained to create 3D models for facial reconstruction surgeries. After 2022, he volunteered as a medic, and was later mobilised. "If the war hadn't happened I may have moved to Copenhagen. I worked there a lot, with the best surgeons," he says.
Instead, he has spent the last years in dugouts around Ukraine. Now, from his position in the north of the country he tries "not to think about the future - I live here and now". He is a combat medic in an unmanned systems battalion. In a sense, he says, his life is his work - just as it was before he joined the army.
For now, there is no end in sight.
"I will rest after the war," he laughs. Then he pauses. "No, there'll be lots of reconstruction surgery to be done then. So, maybe, after that."
Viktor, 28: 'I look at these photos and it's like a different person'
The photo on the left was taken in early 2022 - a few weeks before Viktor took what he says was the most important decision of his life.
He had already served four years in the army and moved to Poland, but the afternoon of the start of the Russian invasion he went back to Ukraine: "Not because I wasn't afraid, but because I had no choice."
"In these photos, I am young. A little boy," he says now. "I barely remember myself like that anymore. But I remember very clearly who I became, and who the war turned me into."
When he shared these photos on social media, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers followed suit: "Our eyes say a lot. There's no need to even spell out the things we have seen or done."
Almost all the friends he joined up with have died.
"I look at these photos and it's like a different person, but at the same time I'm still me - just someone who didn't know what was ahead. It's probably good that I didn't know."
Serhii, 42: Two years as a prisoner of war
The day of the Russian invasion, Serhii – a civilian with a government job - joined the army. By spring he was one of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russia during the siege of the Azovstal steelworks in the coastal city of Mariupol.
He was held for over two years and captivity remains the most harrowing experience of his life. "That feeling of being doomed… Out of everything I've done in the army and in life overall, that was the worst. Not having any idea what the future could bring or what would come next."
During the long days of the siege he speaks of "a profound reassessment of my values - it felt as if you suddenly start rushing to live". He thought about his life before and after the war and set goals for how he would live if he managed to survive. He is now in rehabilitation and lives with his wife and two children.
"If I look at my photo from before the full-scale invasion, I can say only one thing: 'Oh, kid, you have no idea what still awaits you."
Kyrylo, 35: 'I had plans - the war took them all away'
Before 2022, Kyrilo's life was good.
"I had a wife, two children, a house – everything I needed. I had plans."
The war, he says, took it all away.
Kyrylo was held in captivity in Russia for several weeks in 2022 and watched comrades being abused. "It was hard," he says, "when you can't even stand up to defend them."
The return to freedom in Ukraine was no less difficult. "Very often you run into the fact that you're nobody. And for soldiers this happens a lot: while you're fighting, you're something, someone. As soon as you stop - then that's it, you're nobody."

Exclusive
Ukrinform
Winter crops for the 2026 harvest have been sown on 461,000 hectares in Vinnytsia region, down 26,000 hectares from last year.
This was reported to Ukrinform by the Vinnytsia Regional Military Administration (RMA).
“Winter crops for the 2026 harvest have been sown on 461,000 hectares, including 315,000 hectares of winter grains and nearly 146,000 hectares of winter rapeseed,” the RMA reported.
According to updated data, the area under winter crops decreased by 26,000 hectares compared with the previous year.
Recent sampling of monoliths from sown fields showed no damage or plant loss. Winter crops are in good and satisfactory condition.
As reported earlier, despite an unusually cold winter, the condition of winter crops across Ukraine — sown on 6.4 million hectares — remains stable.

'We nearly gave up': These pizza chefs bought their first home. It hasn't been easy

Stoking the wood oven is a daily ritual at a busy Italian restaurant — Boss Pizzeria — in Melbourne's east.
Despite business challenges, married owners Sansita Bootsrakoothanachok and Daniel Barrese have also fired up their finances, and recently bought their first home.
"Very, very proud, we have now achieved a big, big goal in life," Bootsrakoothanachok, 37, told SBS News.
However, their success follows a long struggle to turn their finances around and cut rising costs.
"We had plenty of customers and people loved our food, but the income was not covering costs," Bootsrakoothanachok said.
"After we paid for wages, rent and running costs, we had no money left, so we didn't pay ourselves," she said.
"Everything was gone from our account. So, it's not very good for the business."
To boost profits, the couple needed to cut back hard.
"At first it was very stressful, I have to be honest, and we had to make many sacrifices," she said.
Working harder and not drawing a salary is an all-too-familiar small business story, according to credit reporting agency CreditorWatch.
Soaring prices and falling revenues have forced many restaurant and cafe owners in Australia to give up over the past year.
"Around one in 10 food service businesses are shutting their doors," said CEO Patrick Coghlan.
"That could be voluntary administration, it could be insolvency, it could be just closing the business down.
"But this is a record high failure rate and double the national average," he said, referring to data in the latest Business Risk Index for January.
Bootsrakoothanachok and Barrese have survived by analysing costs and making adjustments, such as curbing food waste and getting up early to buy fresh vegetables at the market.
Reducing floor staff has also helped to boost cash flow.
"At first, Daniel was busy in the kitchen, so he had to put a lot of staff on the floor," Bootsrakoothanachok said.
"But I said 'I can manage the floor alone when we not busy and even when we have a full house, I can handle more tables'."
Handling more roles was an exhausting move that took a toll on the couple, who married seven years ago.
"Sometimes we nearly gave up, and my husband actually asked me if I was alright to keep going," Bootsrakoothanachok said.
A migrant from Thailand, Bootsrakoothanachok studied tourism. Barrese trained as a chef in Italy, before migrating to Australia.
"I told him that because I am from Thailand, I am a fighter," Bootsrakoothanachok said.
"And after a year, we met our accountant who asked what we did with the place, because suddenly we started to turn more profit," she said.
However, Coghlan said in the current economy, many cafe and restaurant owners are losing the battle against financial stress.
"The hospitality industry is one of the riskier industries in Australia, and pressure has been building for months," he said.
It's a sentiment echoed by Wes Lambert, CEO of the Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association.
"The cumulative effect of wage and interest rate rises plus other cost increases means that conditions in 2026 are as bad as they have ever been," he said.
"Operators around the country are telling us that there is no money in hospitality, and many are not paying themselves.
"They are certainly are not able to pay any arrears to the Australian Tax Office or clear any back rent that is due.
"If interest rates and mortgage payments continue to rise then already sluggish demand in many segments of food service will only get worse," he said.
Limited spending power
New Australian Bureau of Statistics data reveals that Australians' pay rises are falling behind the rising cost of living.
The Wage Price Index for the 12 months to December 2025 showed that wages grew 3.4 per cent, lower than inflation for the same period of 3.8 per cent.
This is reducing disposable income for dining out.
It also means that smaller food service operators running on razor-thin margins are likely to remain at risk, Coghlan said.
"Unfortunately, Australia's food service industry is really under pressure. It is already experiencing a higher rate of business closures than any other industry.
"With recent increases in interest rates and continuing consumer price index challenges, we expect that to continue to really hurt this industry for the rest of the year.
"The cost of ingredients, utilities have climbed and continue to climb.
"We are also seeing rent pressure, which is squeezing cafes, dining rooms and restaurants.
"Many owners are locked into leases in key retail precincts where landlords have pushed sharp increases as pandemic-era concessions ended," he said.
Hard work and cost-cutting have helped turn the tables at Boss Pizzeria, and Bootsrakoothanachok hopes to be an inspiration to others.
"We've been able to get rid of all our debts, so we do not have any loans associated with the business," she said.
Friendly customer service has also helped build customer loyalty.
"This is the best pizza I've ever had, and I keep coming back because I love the taste, I love the atmosphere," patron Angela Harris said.
Bootsrakoothanachok hopes to open a second business this year, and recently returned from visiting family in Thailand.
"I just have to keep fighting until I win, and I have actually won now," she said.
"So, I am very proud of myself."

Microsoft Xbox chief Phil Spencer retires, replaced by AI executive Asha Sharma

09:16:18 KST

Microsoft's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, is leaving the software maker following a 38-year tenure, as the company's Xbox business faces increased challenges.
"Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that was published on Friday. "I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership."
Spencer's exit follows the departures of business development chief Chris Young and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke in 2025. Charlie Bell, who had been Microsoft's most high-ranking security leader, switched to an individual contributor role earlier this month.
Revenue from video games at Microsoft declined about 10% in the December quarter from a year earlier, a steeper drop than the company expected, while total revenue grew nearly 17%. Microsoft announced an unspecified impairment charge in its gaming business in January.
The company made a $75 billion bet to expand its games business with the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and it released Call of Duty titles as a cloud service. But current generation Xbox consoles haven't been as popular as Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Switch, and Microsoft has shuttered studios working on new games.
Nadella said in the memo that Spencer, who took charge of Xbox in 2014 after running the company's gaming studios, nearly tripled Microsoft's gaming business, in part through acquisitions like Activision Blizzard. Spencer also pushed for Microsoft to take over Minecraft developer Mojang.
"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it," Nadella wrote.
After Nadella became CEO in 2014, Sony was selling more consoles than Microsoft, and investors had floated the idea of spinning out consumer assets such as Xbox. Analyst Rick Sherlund of Nomura estimated that the division could lose more than $1 billion for the year.
"The question is, do we go forward with Xbox?" Spencer said in a 2020 interview with gaming website Shacknews. Spencer said he persuaded Nadella to bring hardware, software and game-development groups into one organization.
Asha Sharma, who joined Microsoft in 2024 from Instacart, will take over for Spencer, becoming CEO of gaming and reporting to Nadella. Until now, she has been president of product in Microsoft's Core AI business, which former Meta executive Jay Parikh runs. Before arriving at Instacart in 2021 and serving as operating chief, Sharma spent four years as a vice president of product and engineering at Meta and two years in marketing at Microsoft.
"We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world," Sharma wrote in a message to Microsoft's gaming employees.
She has worked on artificial intelligence products such as the Foundry for incorporating AI models into third-party applications.
"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop," Sharma wrote. "Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us."
Sharma said Microsoft will renew its commitment to console gaming. Microsoft's original Xbox came out in 2001.
Matt Booty, head of Microsoft's gaming studios, will report to Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.
"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward," Nadella wrote.
Sarah Bond, president and operating chief of the Xbox unit, will leave Microsoft.
"I've had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond told Xbox employees in a message she also posted to LinkedIn. "She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this."
Bond and Spencer both said they will advise Sharma on the transition.
WATCH: Microsoft is still a buy for the longer term investor, says CFRA's Sam Stovall

Blanket 10% tariffs on all countries effective ‘almost immediately’, Trump says

Trump says he will raise new global tariffs to 15% after hitting out at ‘terrible’ Supreme Court
Mr Trump’s ‘reciprocal tariffs’, imposed under an emergency powers law, were overturned by the US Supreme Court
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump has increased global tariffs to 15 per cent as he hit out at a Supreme Court ruling that struck down his previous import levies, calling the ruling "terrible" and branding the justices who rejected his trade policy as "fools".
On Friday, the US president said he would replace the tariffs axed by the court with a 10 per cent tax on all goods entering the US. But in a post on Truth Social on Saturday he announced plans to increase this to 15 per cent.
The US president’s “reciprocal tariffs”, imposed on most of the rest of the world last April under an emergency powers law, were overturned by the US Supreme Court on Friday in a major blow to the president’s economic agenda.
But he doubled down on imposing levies following the decision, claiming the court “has been swayed by foreign interests” and other countries were “dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long, that I can assure you”.
The UK scrambled to respond in the wake of the announcement, with ministers saying they expect the country’s “privileged trading position with the US” to continue following the Supreme Court’s ruling.
The UK received the lowest tariff rate of 10 per cent, and a subsequent deal struck by Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Trump saw further carve-outs for Britain’s steel industry and car manufacturers.
The US president’s latest tariff announcements raise questions over whether those deals still stand, although officials are understood to believe it will not impact on most of the UK’s trade with America, including preferential deals on steel, cars and pharmaceuticals.
Posting on Truth Social on Saturday afternoon, Mr Trump said: “I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the U.S. off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.”
It came after a post on Friday evening said: “It is my Great Honor to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a Global 10 per cent Tariff on all Countries, which will be effective almost immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP”
He later added in a follow-up post criticising the Supreme Court Justices who ruled against his levies: “Their decision was ridiculous but, now the adjustment process begins, and we will do everything possible to take in even more money than we were taking in before!”
Speaking at the White House earlier, Mr Trump said the Supreme Court decision affirmed his ability to charge more tariffs under different statutes.
He said: “In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past… period of a year.
“Under the various tariffs authorities, so we can use other of the statutes, other of the tariff authorities, which have also been confirmed and are fully allowed.
“Therefore, effective immediately, all national security tariffs under Section 232 and existing Section 301 tariffs, they’re existing, they’re there, remain in place, fully in place. And in full force.
“Today I will sign an order to impose a 10 per cent global tariff under Section 122, over and above our normal tariffs already being charged.
“And we’re also initiating several Section 301 and other investigations to protect our country from unfair trading practises of other countries and companies.”
A UK government spokesperson said: “This is a matter for the US to determine but we will continue to support UK businesses as further details are announced.
“Under any scenario, we expect our privileged trading position with the US to continue and will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world.”
It was an updated version of a statement released earlier in response to the court ruling, but removed a reference to the UK enjoying “the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally”.
In the wake of the announcement, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK government should sue Mr Trump for 100 billion dollars for the damage caused to the UK by trade tariffs, arguing it is “the only language he understands.”
He branded Mr Trump the “most dangerous, damaging US president of modern times” as he welcomed the “brilliant” decision by the US Supreme Court on Friday.
It came after Mr Trump said that some trade deals negotiated after he imposed his reciprocal tariffs will no longer be valid after the US Supreme Court ruling.
“Some of them stand. Many of them stand. Some of them won’t, and they’ll be replaced with the other tariffs,” he said.
When he first announced the 10 per cent “global tariff”, the US president said it would be in place for around five months.
“We’re going straight ahead with 10 per cent straight across the board… and then during that period of about five months, we are doing the various investigations necessary to put fair tariffs, or tariffs period, on other countries.
“So we’re doing that, period, but we’re immediately instituting the 10 per cent provision, which we’re allowed to do. And in the end, I think we’re taking more money than we’ve taken in before.”
The US has collected more than 133 billion dollars (£98.4 billion) since Mr Trump imposed the tariffs, but now faces the prospect of having to refund that money to importers.
Friday’s decision, approved by a 6-3 majority, found that a 1977 law did not give Mr Trump the power to impose tariffs without the approval of the US Congress.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the decision did little to “clear the murky waters for business” around US tariffs.
William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said Mr Trump could use other legislation to reimpose tariffs.
He said: “For the UK, the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible. It’s important the UK Government continues to negotiate on issues like steel and aluminium tariffs and reduces the scope of other possible duties.”
Campaign group Best for Britain said the decision “underlines the instability of doing deals with Trump’s USA and the importance of forging deeper, more reliable trade with our EU neighbours”.

Why is South Korea angry that Yoon Suk Yeol wasn’t sentenced to death?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

09:10:53 KST

On Thursday, former president Yoon Suk Yeol was found guilty of leading an insurrection and sentenced to life imprisonment with labour over his failed martial law declaration in December 2024.
When he received his sentence, hundreds of his opponents cheered outside the court. But the mood quickly shifted to disappointment and anger.
What has the reaction been to Yoon’s sentencing? Although life imprisonment and the death penalty are in effect the same in a country that has not executed anyone since 1997, many South Koreans see Yoon’s sentence as dangerously lenient.
A Gwangju civic coalition called the life term “a failure to deliver even minimal justice”. Other South Korean human rights groups , civic groups , labour unions and political parties also issued statements expressing dismay.
Democratic party leader Jung Chung-rae, who had prepared a speech celebrating a death sentence, said the verdict was “a clear retreat” from the citizens’ movement that stopped the December 2024 martial law attempt .
International human rights groups opposed the death penalty for Yoon, while acknowledging the gravity of the charges.
Why are people upset about the punishment? Anger is rooted in South Korea’s history of elite impunity, and the severity of the punishment, rather than a desire for an execution.
In 1996, military dictator Chun Doo-hwan received the death penalty for leading a 1979 coup and the subsequent massacre in Gwangju . His sentence was reduced to life on appeal. He was then pardoned and released in 1997. He lived freely until his death in 2021.
In closing arguments, prosecutors said the death penalty in South Korea’s criminal justice system “does not mean execution but rather functions as the community’s will to respond to crime.”
The criminal code offers only three punishments for the ringleaders of an insurrection: death, life with labour, or life without labour. Thursday’s verdict gave Yoon life with labour, which allows parole after 20 years. A death sentence, offering no chance of parole, would have sent a stronger signal that such acts cannot be mitigated.
What was the court’s reasoning? Judge Jee Kui-youn cited several mitigating factors: Yoon’s planning didn’t appear meticulous, he attempted to limit force, most of his plans failed, he had no prior criminal record, had long served in public office, and was relatively old at 65.
Critics dismissed the reasoning as perverse. Lawmakers argued long public service should aggravate, not mitigate, abuse of state power. They noted the coup was halted by citizen resistance and parliamentary intervention, not Yoon’s restraint. Progressive newspaper Hankyoreh wrote in an editorial that “the judiciary is showing behaviour that falls far short of citizens’ standards.”
One human rights group pointed to recent German prosecutions of elderly former Auschwitz guards as evidence that state crimes by those in power cannot be excused by age or clean records.
Could Yoon be pardoned? South Korea has convicted four conservative former presidents before Yoon.
Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo were pardoned in 1997. In the democratic era, Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak were pardoned after serving a few years each.
Many fear a life sentence makes a future pardon more politically feasible, whereas death would raise the political cost.
Political parties are pushing an insurrection pardon prohibition bill through parliament. Democratic party leader Jung said it would pass soon , warning that the judiciary’s leniency toward Chun Doo-hwan had “returned like a boomerang” and resulted in “another tragedy”.
How has Yoon reacted to his sentencing? In a statement released on Friday, Yoon maintained his martial law declaration was “for the nation and the people” and “deeply apologised” for the frustrations and hardships experienced by citizens due to his “inadequacies”. He showed no remorse for the act itself, calling it a “decision to save the nation”.
He questioned whether appealing was worthwhile, accusing the judiciary of a lack of independence, but his legal team clarified the statement did not mean he was abandoning his potential appeal. He urged supporters: “Our fight is not over. We must unite and rise.”

The EPA just loosened mercury rules for coal plants. Here’s what the toxic metal can do to your health
Environmental and health groups blasted the decision, saying it would leave all Americans in danger

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has moved to repeal a Biden-era rule that limits the amount of toxic air pollution produced by coal-burning power plants.
The action could allow the plants to release more dangerous heavy metals, including brain-damaging mercury and cancer-causing arsenic, marking yet another step by the administration to reverse Biden policies.
It comes a week after the EPA announced it would repeal its landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health.
EPA Deputy Administrator David Fotouhi claimed that the 2024 amendments to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards had “imposed burdensome and unnecessary requirements that put grid reliability and baseload power at risk,” adding that human health protections established in 2012 remain in place.
“By repealing these needless and costly changes made by the Biden-Harris administration, we are demonstrating that we do not need to choose between protecting human health and economic grow - we can choose BOTH,” he wrote in a social media post. The EPA says rescinding the standards is expected to save an estimated $670 million.
Health experts and environmental groups say that the decision is a grave mistake that could come with deadly consequences for all Americans.
“It is unconscionable from a public health standpoint and a further betrayal of EPA’s mission,” the American Lung Association said, pointing out that the EPA had granted exemptions to dozens of power plants earlier this year.
The American Public Health Association wrote that the standards had been life-saving, reducing nearly 90 percent of mercury emissions from the power sector.
“Millions are breathing cleaner air because of these protections under the Clean Air Act, and we urge EPA to rescind this dangerous decision,” it said.
The Sierra Club said that the Trump administration’s action would triple the amount of mercury the nation’s “dirtiest plants” are allowed to release, leaving the public at a greater risk of heart and lung disease, developmental delays and learning disabilities, cancer and premature death.
“This is the complete opposite of making Americans healthy,” Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp said in a statement. “This is despicable and reckless, and we will continue to defend our communities from these health hazards caused by coal plants.”
The Trump administration is pushing to ramp up fossil fuel production and revitalize the coal industry, which had taken blows during the Biden administration. The EPA wrote that repealing the standards was another step to reversing “Democrats’ war on beautiful clean coal.”
John Walke, senior attorney for the National Resources Defense Council and a former attorney in the EPA’s Office of General Counsel, said that the industry was in decline regardless, and that “dismantling clean air protections won’t bring it back.”
“It will only lead to more asthma attacks, more heart problems, and more premature deaths, especially in communities living in the shadow of coal plants,” he said.
Coal plants spew the major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane, but are also the largest emitters of mercury. They account for 42 percent of total U.S. air emissions, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists.
American coal plants emitted 45,676 pounds of mercury in 2014, according to the EPA’s National Emissions Inventory.
The health effects of mercury exposure may depend on your level of exposure, what form it’s in, your age and health.
Methylmercury is the form that Americans encounter most frequently and the majority of exposures occur through eating fish and shellfish that contain high levels.
The fish are exposed to the poisonous substance when gaseous mercury from air pollution falls into bodies of water. In the water, bacteria can change it into methylmercury, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
Mercury exposure can lead to damage to the kidneys, nervous system and liver in adults, according to scientists.
Mercury is the most harmful during the developmental stages. Infants can be exposed when their mothers eat fish that contain methylmercury, affecting their brains with impacts to their thinking, memory, attention, language and spatial skills, according to the EPA.
Research from the University of Rochester has shown that mercury exposure may disrupt the early development of the connections between muscles and the brain, potentially leading to motor control problems later in life.
Blood mercury levels above 100 nanograms per milliliter - the measurement of mercury - are linked to clear signs of mercury poisoning, such as poor muscle coordination and tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, according to the New York State Department of Health.
There are no confirmed deaths from mercury poisoning in the U.S.
Notably, Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., said he was once poisoned by mercury due to eating a lot of tuna.
“The mercury is coming from those coal-burning power plants,” Kennedy said while testifying before Congress in 2008. “In 49 states, at least some of the fish are unsafe to eat.”
It’s been 14 years since the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards were first finalized under former President Barack Obama, resulting in legal challenges.
In 2012, the EPA said its rule would help reduce mercury emissions, projecting as many as 11,000 fewer deaths from polluting power plants.
In 2024, updates expanded emissions monitoring, set stricter pollution limits and eliminated a regulatory loophole that facilities used to exceed emission limits each time they started up.
Repealing these protections will allow more mercury and toxic air pollution, said Surbhi Sarang, Senior Attorney at Environmental Defense Fund.
“This handout to a dying industry will result in more deaths, chronic health problems, and suffering among children, the elderly, and pregnant women,” Ryan Maher, a staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement shared with The Independent.
“No one voted for dirtier air, higher medical bills, and sicker kids, but that’s what Trump is delivering.”
Air pollution is responsible for more than 135,000 early deaths each year in the U.S., according to the State Department, and a World Economic Forum study found it costs Americans $2,500 a year in health care.

Charles Bronson releases letter from prison ahead of parole hearing

Charles Bronson releases letter from prison ahead of parole hearing
‘I have to expose this unlawful sentence and treatment,’ he said in a letter
- Bookmark
Charles Bronson has vowed to “expose” his “unlawful sentence and treatment” as his plea for release is to be considered at an oral hearing in the coming months.
The 73-year-old – once considered one of Britain’s most violent offenders – could be invited to speak at the meeting after eight failed attempts to seek parole.
“I am 23 years over my tariff. I am forever denied progress. I am forever kept in solitary,” Bronson wrote in a letter to Sky News. “They won't even take me off Cat A."
He added: “I have to expose this unlawful sentence and treatment. It's now gone on for far to long [sic] it’s become a total joke.”
Bronson - who is also known by the surname Salvador after he changed it in tribute to the artist Salvador Dali - has spent most of the last 50 years in prison for a string of violent offences.
They include thefts, firearm crimes and violence, and 11 hostage-taking incidents in nine different sieges.
After 12 years without a violent conviction, it was decided that Bronson’s case would be reconsidered, allowing witnesses and evidence to be assessed to determine his current risk level.
It will then be decided whether he is safe enough to be released into the community.
“My hopes for the hearing are that Mr Salvador can finally have some progression,” his lawyer Gurdeep Singh told the broadcaster.
“He has been languishing in solitary confinement for years now without any future plans for him.
“With the right support in place, there is no reason why he should not be released into the community, allowing Mr Salvador to continue focusing on his charity work with the Born Art Foundation.”
In 2000, Bronson was handed a discretionary life sentence after taking a prison teacher at HMP Hull hostage for 44 hours. Since then, he has been denied all pleas for parole.
Diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, Bronson – whose birth name was Michael Peterson – was convicted of his first crime in 1974 at the age of 21. He reoffended during two brief periods of freedom and was sent back to prison.
His last appeal for parole was rejected at a public oral hearing in March 2023. He is said to have spent most of his time in prison in solitary confinement, with up to 23 hours a day spent locked in his cell.
He said while he used to find violence “cathartic”, he has since sought solace in his art and practices “deep breathing” to cope with negative feelings, and he now professes to be “anti-crime” and no longer violent.
A date for the hearing has not yet been set.

Hungary threatens veto of €90 billion EU loan to Ukraine

Hungary threatens veto of €90 billion EU loan to Ukraine
February 21, 2026After agreeing to provide Ukraine a €90 billion ($106 billion) EU loan package, officials in Budapest said on Friday they plan to veto the deal unless Russian oil starts flowing in a pipeline to Hungary.
"As long as Ukraine blocks the Druzhba pipeline, Hungary will block the €90 billion Ukrainian war loan. We will not be pushed around!" Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote on Facebook.
Ukrainian officials say the oil flows through the Druzhba pipeline, which carries Russian oil across Ukraine to Hungary and Slovakia, have been disrupted since Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure damaged it in January.
Hungarian and Slovakian politicians, however, accuse the Ukrainian leadership of blocking the resumption of supplies. Both countries rely heavily on the pipeline for their oil imports and are the most Russia-friendly governments in the European Union.
On Wednesday, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico declared a state of emergency over supplies and threatened retaliatory measures against Ukraine if the pipeline was not reopened.
Hungary decries pipeline 'blackmail' ahead of election
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the stop to oil flows in the pipeline "blackmail."
"Ukraine is blackmailing Hungary by halting oil transit in coordination with Brussels and the Hungarian opposition to create supply disruptions in Hungary and push fuel prices higher before the elections," he wrote on X.
For the first time in 16 years, Orban faces the possibility of losing a parliamentary election.
Kyiv has long called on its EU allies to stop buying Russian energy supplies as they help finance Moscow's full-scale invasion, which is about to enter its fifth year.
EU leaders, including Orban, agreed in December to provide Ukraine with up to €90 billion over two years, a decision endorsed by the European Parliament last week. The EU also exempted Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic ― which have all opposed further aid for Kyiv ― from repaying the loan's borrowing costs.
Final approval by the Council of the European Union, made up of national ministers, is still required before the first funds can be disbursed, a step previously regarded as a formality.
That vote has now been postponed.
The funds are intended to cover Ukraine’s most urgent financial needs through the end of 2027 and enable the country to continue defending itself against Russia. Of the total amount, €60 billion is earmarked for defense.

CEO of Mistral AI says warnings about extreme risks of artificial intelligence are often 'distraction tactics'

What is the view of Frenchman Arthur Mensch, the co-founder of Mistral AI, on the warnings about the extreme risks of artificial intelligence that have been issued by leaders of major American tech firms such as Sam Altman and Dario Amodei? At the AI summit in India, held from February 16 to February 20, OpenAI CEO Altman raised the idea of creating a kind of "[International Atomic Energy Agency] for international coordination of AI," in response to the emergence of "true superintelligence," which he said could appear within "a couple of years." Meanwhile, Anthropic founder Amodei published a lengthy essay at the end of January, "The Adolescence of Technology," in which he outlined the risks of advanced AI systems or their use to create biological weapons.
"These are mostly distraction tactics," responded Mensch, who was interviewed on Friday, February 20, by Le Monde and by the radio station France Inter at the New Delhi AI summit. "In reality, the real risk of artificial intelligence in the near future is [that] of massive influence on how people think and how they vote," he argued, taking a position contrary to his American counterparts. The head of the French AI start-up had already raised concerns about the risk of an "information oligopoly" forming with AI assistants such as ChatGPT (OpenAI) or Grok (xAI). He described them as potential "thought control instruments" and expressed fears about manipulation attempts during elections.

Scottish independence ‘within reach’ as Westminster ‘unravelling’ amid scandals, Swinney says
A survey by More in Common this week projected that the SNP would win 64 seats after May
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Scottish independence is "within reach", John Swinney has declared, following a new poll projection that places his party just one seat short of a majority in this year’s Holyrood election.
A survey by More in Common this week forecasts the Scottish National Party (SNP) securing 64 seats in May, with Reform and Labour battling for second place, and the Conservatives potentially falling to joint fourth alongside the Liberal Democrats.
The First Minister has set the bar for another independence vote as the SNP winning a majority of seats, though the UK government has rejected a discussion granting a new referendum.
Mr Swinney asserted that the "stream of chaos and scandal" at Westminster – including the recent controversy surrounding Lord Peter Mandelson – indicates that the "Westminster status quo is rapidly unravelling".
“People in Scotland, watching the news unfold night after night, know that Britain is broken beyond repair – it cannot and it will not be fixed – it is locked in a cycle that only knows chaos, lurching from economic mess one week to corruption scandal the next,” the First Minister said.
“Faced with that reality, momentum is once again building behind the knowledge that independence offers the chance to escape a broken Westminster system and a chance to build our own country anew – that momentum means that an SNP majority and that fresh start with independence is now within reach.
“Here in Scotland the SNP has been delivering on the priorities of Scotland from opening our first GP walk-in centre to freezing rail fares, but that fundamental concept is now ever-present in the minds of Scots – Westminster doesn’t work for Scotland.
“The key question in May is now clear – we can either stay stuck to this broken Westminster system, or we can build a future beyond broken, Brexit Britain.
“We can choose a new Scotland through the fresh start of independence.”
The comments come at the end of a week where the First Minister has been forced to defend his top law officer.
Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC was accused by opposition MSPs of “corruption” after she updated the First Minister on the embezzlement charges against the former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell weeks before they were made public.

Energy bills set to fall across the UK – but experts issue future warning
Energy bills could drop by more than £200 for some households from April
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The massive drop in household energy costs expected in April could be short-lived, experts have warned, as the government is urged to ensure that changes will last.
Energy regulator Ofgem is expected to announce on Wednesday that its energy price cap for April to June will drop by £120 from its current level. The substantial drop is driven by the government’s move to cut energy bills by scrapping an energy efficiency programme.
This will “deliver a clear boost to living standards”, think tank the Resolution Foundation found, adding this should “help to keep bills below current levels until at least 2029”.
A new report from the influential unit also credited the progressive effect of the measure, finding the design of the policy will benefit lower-income households the most. Due to this, around a quarter of households (24 per cent) will save more than £200 this year.
The changes will also make the typical energy bill £200 lower than in 2024 in real terms, researchers found, which is a welcome drop after the pressures of the Covid pandemic and cost of living crisis.
However, they added this could be eroded in just three years. They estimated policy costs and investment in network infrastructure mean bills will be just £60 lower on average than today in March 2029, and the end of the government’s discount scheme a month later will add another £55.
This means a “cliff edge” looms, the Resolution Foundation said, as the government will need to decide whether to allow bills to rise or find funding to extend the support. It added ministers should not “wait until the eleventh hour to decide” and should instead set out a durable framework before 2029.
Jonathan Marshal, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Next week’s energy price cap announcement will show a significant drop in household bills, largely because of the government’s £6.9 billion energy bill discount.
“The policy is well designed. By reducing electricity unit rates, it supports the shift towards electrification at the same time as delivering savings worth twice as much to the poorest families as to the richest, as a share of spending.

“However, this support is due to end in April 2029. The government should set out a clear and durable framework for deciding which energy policy costs are funded by bills and which through taxation soon, to avoid scrambling for a solution in an election year.”
A Department of Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: “This government is delivering on our promise to take an average of £150 of costs off bills from 1 April. Ofgem will set out the final price cap figure in the usual way next week.
“Tackling the energy affordability crisis is our number one priority – and this is just the start.
“We are getting off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuels and onto clean homegrown power which we control, to bring down bills for good.”

Where is Kim Ju-ae? Succession question hangs over North Korea’s ruling congress
With Kim Jong-un set to outline his end-of-decade vision, the notable absence of his teenage daughter raises fresh succession questions
State media described the opening of the ninth congress of the Workers’ Party of Korea as unfolding “with splendour” in “the capital city of the revolution”, with 5,000 delegates and 2,000 observers in attendance.
The carefully choreographed event, which by historical precedent will run for between four and eight days, is expected to map out national priorities through the end of this decade – spanning defence, inter-Korean relations, economic management and ideological direction.
At the congress’ core is a dual-track military strategy Kim has been telegraphing for months. During a September inspection of weapons institutes, he announced plans to “simultaneously push forward the building of nuclear forces and conventional armed forces”.
In January, standing at a large-calibre multiple rocket launcher test site, he declared he would unveil “the next step” in nuclear war deterrence at the congress itself.

Trump, Vance unleash assault on 'disloyal' Supreme Court justices after tariff ruling
Unknown

US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have launched an extraordinary personal attack on the Supreme Court justices who struck down Trump’s global tariffs, including two of his own appointees, and claimed they were being "swayed by foreign interests."
"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump told reporters at a White House press conference on Friday.
"They're very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution," he said, deriding them at one point as "fools and lap dogs."
The Supreme Court has overwhelmingly sided with Trump since he took office in January of last year, and the tariffs ruling was the first major setback for the Republican president before the conservative-dominated court.
Asked if he regretted nominating justices Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch — who both voted against him — to the top court, Trump said he did not "want to say whether or not I regret."
"I think their decision was terrible," he said. "I think it's an embarrassment to their families if you want to know the truth, the two of them."
Chief Justice John Roberts, Coney Barrett and Gorsuch, all conservatives, joined with the court's three liberals in the 6-3 ruling that Trump's sweeping global tariffs were illegal.
Trump heaped praise on the conservative justices who voted to uphold his authority to levy tariffs — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee.
He thanked the three "for their strength and wisdom, and love of our country."
Trump in particular singled out Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent to the tariffs ruling, calling him a "genius" and saying he was "so proud of him."
'You're going to find out'
The president also alleged there was foreign influence behind the ruling.
"It's my opinion that the court has been swayed by foreign interests," he said. "I think that foreign interests are represented by people that I believe have undue influence.
"They have a lot of influence over the Supreme Court, whether it's through fear or respect or friendships, I don't know," he said.
Asked by a reporter if he had evidence of foreign influence on the court, Trump replied: "You're going to find out."
Vice President JD Vance added his voice to the condemnation of the tariffs ruling, calling it "lawlessness from the court, plain and simple."
"Today, the Supreme Court decided that Congress, despite giving the president the ability to 'regulate imports,' didn't actually mean it," Vance said on X.
"This is lawlessness from the Court, plain and simple. And its only effect will be to make it harder for the president to protect American industries," he added.
'Separation of powers'
Steven Schwinn, a constitutional law professor at the University of Illinois Chicago, said Trump's "gratuitous and ad homineum attacks" on individual justices reveal "his fundamental misunderstanding of the separation of powers."
"He seems to believe that any good-faith disagreement with his own interpretation of the law is, by definition, illegitimate," Schwinn told the AFP news agency.
"At the same time, he lacks any serious interpretation of the law of his own, except to say that the law is what he wants it to be. This is not how a democracy works."
Trump was also asked whether the six justices who voted against him would be welcome at next week's State of the Union speech before Congress.
"Three are happily invited," the president said.
The others are "invited, barely," he said, before adding "I couldn't care less if they come."

What the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down tariffs means for L.A.’s trade-dependent economy
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
The Supreme Court’s decision Friday to strike down the majority of tariffs imposed by President Trump could provide some relief to L.A.’s trade-reliant economy — but only if they are not reimposed again through other means.
The court’s 6-3 ruling that Trump didn’t have the authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act rolled back levies that have upended international trade.
“We’ve seen that the tariffs have a significant impact on our supply chain, on our manufacturers and especially on our port logistics and trade sector,” said Stephen Cheung, chief executive of the nonprofit Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
“I think this decision will have a significant impact on the Los Angeles economy. However, it’s going to take a long time to unravel, so we’ll see specifically how everything is going to pan out,” he said.
Port of Los Angeles Executive director Gene Seroka outlined upcoming infrastructure and climate investments at the 11th annual State of the Port.
The tariffs dealt a blow to a large swath of businesses in Southern California and across the state, including farmers, automakers, home builders, tech companies and apparel retailers.
MGA Entertainment, the Chatsworth maker of Bratz dolls, said a little more than half of its products are made in China, while hardware and lumber seller Anawalt in Malibu said the majority of its lumber comes from Canada and nearly all of its steel products are made in China.
Business owners around the state struggle to keep up with an ever-changing slew of trade policies.
During a news conference Friday following the decision, Trump said that under other legal authorities he would impose a 10% global tariff and pursue additional levies, including a possible 30% tariff on foreign cars. Later in the day he signed an order imposing the 10% tax, which takes effect Feb. 24.
“The Supreme Court’s ruling on tariffs is deeply disappointing, and I’m ashamed of certain members of the court — absolutely ashamed,” Trump said. “They’re very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution.”
Friday’s high-court decision affects up to $170 billion in tariffs collected under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, including 10% to 50% duties and penalties on China, Canada and Mexico.
Whether importers who paid the tax can seek refunds was left to a lower court to decide. It’s estimated some $100 billion in tariffs were not affected by the decision.
The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach — which handle nearly a third of the nation’s containerized cargo and are the primary trade gateway to Asia — saw a surge of traffic the first half of last year as importers sought to get ahead of the tariffs, largely imposed in April.
Under a new chief executive, the Port of Long Beach is getting ready to double its cargo capacity by 2050. The port handled a record amount of cargo in 2025.
However, traffic tailed off the second half of the year, with the L.A. port expecting a single-digit decline in volume this year before Friday’s decision.
The twin facilities form the largest ports complex in North America, supporting more than 200,000 jobs and contributing $28 billion to the regional economy in 2022, according to a California Center for Jobs & the Economy report.
The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs derives from the complexity of the tariffs themselves — as well as the other legal options Trump has to impose them again.
Mike Jacob, president of the Pacific Merchant Shipping Assn., which represents ocean carriers, marine terminal operators and others in the industry, said the tendency is to think of the tariffs as uniform.
“It was different rates for different countries. That was compounded by different rates for different commodities. And there’s a lot of changes that have occurred with specific commodities,” he said. “So it’s almost impossible to take a broad brush and say, here’s what we expect to happen — except to say that it’s still a pretty unsettled space.”
In imposing a 10% global tariff, Trump would be relying on a provision of the Trade Act of 1974, while his ability to pursue additional levies would rely on other law.
Economist Jock O’Connell, international trade advisor at L.A.’s Beacon Economics, said that Trump may have authority to impose the 10% global tariffs, but additional levies would involve trade authorities.
“That would be a cumbersome process. The tariffs have to be more specifically framed and the subject of an investigation,” he said.
Also complicating the process are trade deals the U.S. has been negotiating with foreign countries based on the tariffs. O’Connell expects they will seek to renegotiate them.
“They’re likely to come back to the table and say, ‘Well, you don’t have the authority to impose these,’” he said.
Trump told reporters that his administration will impose new tariffs by using alternative legal means.
Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, said importers are facing tough decisions right now, given that any ocean carrier leaving an Asian port today would not be subject to the tariffs that were struck down.
“That executive is asking: ‘Are my commodities now exempt from this tariff?’ If the answer is yes, ‘Can I buy more of that product and get it shipped while there are no tariffs?’” he said.
Those decisions would revolve around such factors as the availability of space on the vessel and local warehouses, as well as trucking services, he said.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the decision should be good news for the larger U.S. economy and businesses on the “front line” of the trade wars, such as transportation, distribution, agriculture and retail.
“If the president lets the Supreme Court decision stand and doesn’t try to replace the tariffs, that’s a plus for the economy — but that’s not what’s going to happen,” he said.

Bayern Munich coach Vincent Kompany has criticised José Mourinho for attacking the character of Vinícius Júnior after the Real Madrid star accused an opponent of racially insulting him during a Champions League match.
Benfica coach Mourinho suggested that Brazil forward Vinícius had incited Benfica's players with his celebrations after scoring the only goal in Tuesday's play-off match.
Vinícius accused Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni of calling him "monkey" during a confrontation after his goal.
Mourinho also questioned why Vinícius, who has been subjected to repeated racist insults in Spain, was so frequently targeted.
"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium," Mourinho said.
"The stadium where Vinícius played something happened. Always."
Speaking on Friday, Kompany condemned Mourinho's comments.
"So after the game you have the leader of an organisation, José Mourinho, who attacks the character of Vinícius Júnior by bringing in the type of celebration to discredit what Vinícius is doing in this moment," Kompany said.
"For me in terms of leadership, it's a huge mistake and it's something that we should not accept."
UEFA appointed a special investigator on Wednesday to gather evidence about what happened in Lisbon in Madrid's 1-0 win in the first leg of the Champions League play-offs.
Madrid said it had sent "all available evidence" of the alleged incident to European soccer's governing body.
Referring to Vinícius' celebrations after curling a shot into the top corner, Mourinho said he should "celebrate in a respectful way".
Kompany pointed out Mourinho's own history of exuberant celebrations — such as when he ran down the sideline to cheer when his Porto team beat Manchester United in the Champions League.
Kompany said Mourinho's former players "love him" and added: "I know he's a good person."
"I don't need to judge him as a person, but I know what I've heard. I understand maybe what he's done, but he's made a mistake and it's something that hopefully in the future won't happen like this again," he said.
Argentinian Prestianni has denied racially insulting Vinícius, with Benfica claiming their player is the victim of a "defamation campaign".

Ukraine liberates 300 square kilometers in southern counteroffensive, Zelensky tells AFP

Ukraine liberates 300 square km in southern counteroffensive, Zelensky says — here's what that means
Ukrainian forces have liberated 300 square kilometers (116 square miles) of territory from Russian occupation in a new southern counteroffensive, President Volodymyr Zelensky told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in an interview on Feb. 20.
The president's report comes as Kyiv faces mounting pressure from the United States to withdraw troops from Ukrainian-controlled territory as part of a deal with Russia to end the war.
"You can't say that we're losing the war. Honestly, we're definitely not losing it, definitely," Zelensky told AFP during an exclusive interview in Kyiv. "The question is whether we will win."
Zelensky said Ukraine was advancing along the southern front line, but did not specify the specific sector or time frame of the counteroffensive.
"I won't go into too many details, but today I can congratulate our army first and foremost —all the defense forces — because as of today, 300 (square) kilometers have been liberated," he claimed.
While the war for a winning narrative remains important on the international stage, the reality on the ground is far from a black-and-white counteroffensive success.
Over February, dozens videos emerged on social media of Ukrainian forces conducting offensive operations in the part of the front line where Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts meet.
The area, lacking major geographical features, has been the most fluid part of the front line since autumn last year, when Russian forces began advancing at a greater pace against weaker Ukrainian brigades.
Operating in a wide contested "grey zone" with infiltrations on both sides, the Ukrainian advances trackable in open sources remain no more than extended clearing operations, rather than capturing and taking of Russian-held lines of defense.
Apart from clearing operations in response to Russian breakthroughs, Ukraine's military has been fighting in a posture of strategic defense over the past year.
Russia launched a renewed ground offensive against Ukraine in 2025, concentrating the bulk of its forces in eastern Donetsk Oblast. As part of the campaign, Russia also intensified operations in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast and broke into the southern part of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.
Zelensky reported in September 2025 that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations successfully liberated 160 square kilometers (60 square miles) of territory in Donetsk Oblast and another 170 square kilometers (65 square miles) elsewhere on the front lines — though he did not provide further details about these additional 170 kilometers.
Over the course of 2025, Russian forces occupied a total 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory, according to the open-source mapping project DeepState.
Zelensky's interview followed two days of U.S.-brokered peace talks in Geneva, where Russia and Ukraine failed to achieve a breakthrough on the territorial issue at the heart of the negotiations: the status of Ukraine's Donbas.
Russia continues to demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw entirely from the region as a precondition for any peace deal. Ukraine has rejected that demand, insisting that freezing the current front line offers the most realistic basis for a ceasefire.
"We haven't found constructive solutions on territorial issues," Zelensky said on Feb. 20.

How Trump’s threatened strikes on Iran could backfire
Instead of pushing Tehran towards a nuclear deal, bombing the country could set off a deadly cycle of retaliation, analysts warn
US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he was considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran into signing a new nuclear deal, but bombing the country may have the opposite effect, risking a new destabilising conflict in the Middle East.
The Pentagon has orchestrated a massive deployment to the region that includes two aircraft carriers, fighter jets and refuelling planes, giving Trump the option to launch limited, or extended, operations against Iran.
Yet Trump and other administration officials have given conflicting public accounts of what they actually want from a new deal with Tehran. And Iran experts argue that bombing the country in the middle of negotiations might derail a deal, and could prompt a deadly cycle of retaliation.
Tehran would likely suspend participation in talks if the US launched a strike, according to a senior government official in the region, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.
“He’s not going to get a diplomatic agreement out of the Iranians if he attacks them again,” said Barbara Slavin, a fellow at the Stimson Centre in Washington. The military threats alone – even if the US does not ultimately act on them – “is going to make them less willing to make a deal”.
While Trump has given a deadline of between 10 and 15 days, it also remains unclear what a new round of air strikes – limited or otherwise – would actually achieve.

New study probes why chronic pain lasts longer in women
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK - To all the women who have heard the frustrating “it’s all in your head” in response to medical maladies, a new study out on Feb 20 feels your pain.
Research published in the journal Science Immunology shows that women actually do experience exacerbated chronic pain compared to men – a gap that can be explained by biological differences in the immune system.
“The pain of women has been overlooked in clinical practice,” lead author Geoffroy Laumet told AFP, “with the idea that it’s more in the mind, or that it’s because women are softer and more emotional.”
“But here, our study shows that the difference is real... it’s not a social construct. It has a real biological mechanism that is behind it.”
Pain occurs when neurons react to stimuli: stubbing your toe, or tripping and skinning your knee, for example.
But chronic pain persists with mild to no stimulation – and women constitute 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the patients experiencing it, Dr Laumet said.
The scientist at Michigan State University said his team set out to explore how hormone-regulated immune cells, known as monocytes, impacted pain resolution.
Researchers learned those monocytes play a key role in communicating with the neurons that sense pain – and then working to shut down those pain-sensing neurons by producing the anti-inflammatory interleukin 10, or IL-10.
Their studies were not originally aimed at exploring potential differences related to sex, but the data was clear: it took longer for pain to resolve in female mice, and the monocytes producing IL-10 were less active in them.
Those cells are more active in males, according to the study, which cited higher levels of sex hormones like testosterone as an explanation why.
Dr Laumet is hopeful the new research could open new doors to improved pain treatment.
In the long term, he said research can probe how to stimulate the monocytes and boost IL-10 production to “enhance the body’s ability to resolve pain”.
And in the short term, he sees the potential for topical testosterone to prove a viable option to alleviate localized suffering.
‘More equitable care’
Dr Elora Midavaine – a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who also studies chronic pain – told AFP the new study adds “important nuance” to how we understand the interactions of hormones and the immune system, and their influence on pain.
Dr Midavaine, who was not involved in the study, said it fits into a broader movement focused on intersections of neuroscience with both immunology and endocrinology – an approach she said “has potential to advance our understanding of chronic pain in women”.
Dr Laumet said he hopes that improved understanding and potential new treatment avenues could reduce prescriptions of opioid painkillers, which have high risks of side effects and addiction.
And more broadly, both researchers voiced optimism that as our knowledge of women’s health improves, they will receive better treatment.
“I hope that we can contribute to erase this common idea that women’s pain is exaggerated,” Dr Laumet said. “The standard of care should be adapted to the sex.”
But why has it taken so long to begin understanding the bodies of half the population?
For decades women were excluded from clinical trials, and most pain studies analysing animals only used males, Dr Midavaine noted – a medical bias that operated on the notion that female hormones created “too much variability”.
Diagnosis of pain relies almost wholly on reporting from patients – and the symptoms of women are “often interpreted as emotional or mood-driven rather than rooted in biology,” Dr Midavaine said.
But “the landscape is changing,” Dr Midavaine said. “As the science advances, I believe it will help shift outdated cultural beliefs and lead to more equitable care for women.” AFP

Top-ranked Canadian women upset by Sweden in curling semifinals
The top-ranked Canadian women couldn't overcome "straighter" ice and a sharp Sweden squad, and now the country's controversial men's team will have the curling power's last chance at Olympic gold at the Milan Cortina Games.
With Canada already shut out of the mixed team event medals, Rachel Homan's team was upset by Anna Hasselborg's Sweden in the semifinals Friday.
"They're heartbroken right now," Canada coach Heather Nedohin said.
Sweden, ranked No. 12, will face Switzerland for gold on Sunday.
Sweden, which has won the women's competition three times since curling returned to the Olympic program in 1998, beat Canada 6-3.
Homan had beaten Hasselborg in all three of their previous meetings this season.
"I woke up this morning and just told the girls, 'I really believe we're winning today,'" Hasselborg said, with one of her children in her arms and another playing at her feet.
Silvana Tirinzoni's Switzerland beat the United States 7-4 and will be aiming for their first women's gold at the Olympics.
The Swiss took silver behind Canada at the last two world championships after four straight golds in the biggest curling competition outside of the Olympics.
Canada will play the U.S. for bronze on Saturday. The U.S. women defeated Canada last week for the first time ever last week.
"Obviously disappointed, but our work is not done here," Homan said. "We're going to come out fighting tomorrow."
The Canadians said they struggled with "straighter" ice that "made some shots quite a bit tougher.
"But Sweden played a great game and kudos to them," Homan said.
U.S. vice skip Cory Thiesse, who already won silver in the team event with Korey Dropkin, said she was a little surprised to be facing Canada for bronze.
"They're the No. 1 ranked team in the world. But it's the Olympics and that pressure is hard sometimes and you just never know," Thiesse said. "Our motto this week has just been to keep games close and you never know what is going to happen out there."
In the men's competition, Switzerland routed Norway 9-1 for the bronze medal. Canada faces Britain for gold on Saturday.
The Canadian men were the subject of a controversy that got attention far beyond the ice when several players were accused of double-touching the rock, a rules violation.
In an interview Wednesday, Team USA curler Korey Dropkin — who helped the U.S. last week win silver in mixed doubles curling — told CBS News the controversy was "bigger than it needs to be."
"Throughout the last few seasons, truly there's been a lot of athletes that have done this, and it hasn't really been brought up," Dropkin said. "There's plenty of Olympians that have done the double-touch of flick of the granites."

Netflix releases a posthumous interview with Eric Dane after his death from ALS
Eric Dane shared his thoughts about his life and a final message for his daughters in a new episode of a Netflix series called “Famous Last Words.”
- Bookmark
Eric Dane did not believe in an afterlife.
“I think when the lights go out, it's over," he said in an interview for “Famous Last Words," a Netflix series that's available now. “I do believe that once we go to sleep or however it is we — we go, once we're gone, we're gone.”
He also hoped in the interview that his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, would remember how he was present in their lives. He went to beach volleyball games and dance recitals, adding that he'd seen “The Nutcracker” many times and his review was, "That thing drones on, man.”
The “Grey's Anatomy” and “Euphoria” actor died Thursday less than one year after he announced he was diagnosed with ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease, which is a fatal nerve system disease.
“Famous Last Words” is based on a show that originated in Denmark. The premise is that a person is interviewed — executive producer Brad Falchuk does the questioning in the Netflix show — and it will not be released until their death.
Dane's interview is the second episode. The first was with primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who died last October. Falchuk tells The Associated Press he's recorded five conversations already with plans for more.
No one else was present on set for the taping last November and even the camera operators were in a different room.
“The guest needs to be totally safe to speak honestly and say whatever they want and know that they’re leaving something for people to experience with them not here," Falchuk said on Friday. Only a small number of people work on the production of the show afterward. “Very, very few people have seen it and very, very people even know whose done it,” explained Falchuk.
“Famous people don’t often get an opportunity to speak honestly about themselves and about what they think in the world,” said Falchuk who is married to Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow. “They have to be very protective, especially nowadays. They say things and it goes everywhere and it gets misinterpreted and they also want to keep working or keep you know doing what they do, so this is an opportunity for them not to have to be guarded.”
Dane's ALS advocacy lives on
After his ALS diagnosis, Dane became an advocate to raise awareness and money to fight the disease. After his death, the organization I AM ALS released clips of him recorded for an upcoming documentary.
“It’s a tough thing to respond to, it’s a tough thing to live with, yeah. But it’s really hard for the people around me too. And it’s almost like — in a weird way, it’s to some benefit, because I spend a lot of my time consoling others,” he said in a clip released Friday.
Filmmaker Chris Burke also captured Dane on a trip to Washington D.C. where he lobbied politicians for a bill that would help accelerate research, expand access to treatment and secure one billion dollars in federal funding for ALS patients.
“He understood that ALS is not just a diagnosis; it is a call to action for families, for answers, and for change,” the organization said in a statement after Dane's death.
Dane's last message to his daughters
In the Netflix show, Dane also reflected on the lifelong impact of losing his father at age 7 and subsequent struggles with addiction to drugs and alcohol. He said he immediately knew he would marry Rebecca Gayheart when he met her and shared a memory of a family vacation to France where he spent a car ride speaking with a “spot on” French accent that made everyone laugh.
The most poignant part of the taping was at the end — when Falchuk left the room for Dane to look into the camera and deliver a final message which he dedicated to his daughters. Dane shared that his diagnosis with ALS taught him to be present. He also hoped the girls would “fall in love,” whether it be with a person or something that would make them want to wake up each morning.
“I hope you won't just listen to me. I hope you'll hear me,” he said.
Falchuk said this final message is something each guest has the opportunity to do. "People do all different kinds of stuff. Some people write it. Jane improvised hers. Eric wrote his," said Falchuk, who was visibly emotional at the idea of Dane's daughters watching his message.
“It’s hard to think about that," he said. “They’re grieving and he loved them so much. They loved him so much and they’re just a beautiful family. I don’t know. Maybe they’ll watch it. Maybe they’ll never watch it, whatever it may be.”
Falchuk and Dane had dinner prior to filming and they didn't know each other well, but a new friendship had developed from the experience.
”I’m grieving Eric a lot right now. It’s very hard. I was not expecting this to happen this soon. And I miss him," said Falchuk. "It’s hard when they die. It is hard.”
The exchange seemed to also have an impact on Dane, who told Falchuk, “This is probably the most revealing and in-depth conversation I've had with just about anybody.”

Israeli strikes kill at least 10 and wound 24 in Lebanon, health ministry says

At least 10 people have been killed and 24 wounded – including three children – in Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s eastern Bekaa valley, the Lebanese health ministry has said.
Israel said it had hit “command centres” of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Two security sources told Reuters that the senior Hezbollah leader Hussein Yaghi was killed in the attacks.
Yaghi is the son of former Hezbollah MP Mohamed Yaghi, and his funeral is set to take place on Saturday, according to Hezbollah media.
Local television footage from the scene of one of the strikes showed the targeted site appeared to be an apartment building. Emergency crews were seen firefighting and searching for survivors.
Earlier on Friday another Israeli strike hit a Palestinian refugee camp in the port city of Sidon, killing two people.
The Israeli military said it struck a “Hamas command centre” in the Ain el-Hilweh camp. Hamas acknowledged that two of its members had been killed in the strike but said the claim it was a command centre was a “flimsy pretext”.
It said the targeted building belonged to a joint security force made up of various Palestinian factions tasked with maintaining security in the camp.
After 7 October 2023, Hezbollah began firing rockets from Lebanon into Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians.
Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling. The low-level conflict escalated into full-scale war in September 2024, before being reined in by a US-brokered ceasefire two months later.
Since then, Israel has accused Hezbollah of trying to rebuild and has carried out near-daily strikes in Lebanon that it says target militants and facilities. Hezbollah has claimed one strike against Israel since the ceasefire.
The death toll from Friday’s strikes was unusually high and comes at a moment of heightened tensions in the region with the US threatening to strike Iran – a backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas – if negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme fail to produce a deal.
During last year’s Israel-Iran war, Hezbollah remained on the sidelines but many in Lebanon fear that the country will be pulled in should another war break out.

Protests and power: How violence in Sydney streets put a premier under pressure
First he shared a prestigious award with his supposed nemesis, Dominic Perrottet, for civility in an election campaign. Then he extended invites to former NSW Liberal leaders to cut the ribbon on the metro, the brainchild of the Coalition.
Now Chris Minns heaps praise on Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane for her handling of the Bondi massacre at every opportunity. The NSW premier is, by all accounts, Mr Nice Guy.
Yet, with a little over a year until the next state election, rank-and-file Labor members are wondering who he wants to keep onside. The party faithful are not convinced it is them.
The handling of last Monday’s CBD protest, organised by serial activist Josh Lees against the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, has exposed the simmering discontent among some in the Labor Party as well as several trade unions, who are outraged at what they see as the premier’s draconian erosion of civil liberties.
Four so-called rogue Labor backbenchers attended the anti-Herzog protest, which resulted in 10 people being charged after chaotic scenes broke out, and Minns has sought to paint the MPs as outliers who are not in the tent. But those MPs, two from the Left and two from Minns’ Right faction, are not alone.
On Friday, the South Coast Labour Council summoned their six local MPs, which include Health Minister Ryan Park and Planning Minister Paul Scully, to a “please explain” meeting. Only Anna Watson, MP for Shellharbour, turned up.
The meeting came after the Maritime Union of Australia’s southern NSW branch wrote to the council demanding an explanation from local MPs, and condemned the premier’s defence of police actions “in the strongest possible terms”.
“The totally reprehensible sign of burly NSW Police officers pepper-spraying and aggressively manhandling women and elderly people that posed no credible threat to them was particularly galling and cannot be acceptable in Australian society,” MUA branch secretary Scott Carter wrote.
“Minns is no Gough Whitlam,” says South Coast Labour Council secretary Arthur Rorris, who said “bashing union veterans and grannies” at rallies would not motivate the Labor faithful to work the booths at election time.
“Wollongong can be a tough place for Labor politicians at the best of times, and workers and their unions have this strange expectation that our Labor leaders are put there to help us, not smash us.”
The premier has made his disdain for Lees and the Palestine Action Group’s protest efforts well known. Last year, Minns publicly insisted a march across the Harbour Bridge should not go ahead, before the NSW Police had even filed a court challenge.
Minns would not allow protesters to shut down the city’s “central artery”, he insisted, citing safety concerns. Multiple MPs, including senior ministers Jihad Dib and Penny Sharpe, defied their boss and marched with up to 300,000 people anyway, making internal disagreements over the handling of pro-Palestine protests clear.
In late December, Minns linked the protests to rising antisemitic hatred in the community as justification for crackdowns after the Bondi massacre. Hateful words lead to actions, he said, and vowed to outlaw the phrase “globalise the intifada”.
In the months since, some protesters, including former Australian of the Year Grace Tame, have continued to use the phrase.
Minns’ latest crackdown on the ability to protest included legislating to restrict marches after a terrorism event and declaring the visit of Herzog a major event, triggering extra police powers to move on protesters.
The morning after the chaotic scenes at Town Hall, when vision of police punching and charging at protesters were being spread like wildfire on social media, the premier did not deviate from his staunch defence of police officers.
The clips did not show the full context, Minns stressed, and officers were faced with exceptional circumstances trying to prevent the unruly protesters from clashing with mourners at Herzog’s nearby event. The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission is now investigating the actions of police.
The biggest political headache for the premier, however, has come not from these incidents, but from viral footage showing a group of Muslim worshippers, heads bowed in prayer, being aggressively moved on by officers.
Muslim community leaders called on the premier to apologise for the hurt and distress the disruption of such a sacred act had caused the community. Minns would not. Even after this masthead revealed a senior officer gave the go-ahead for worshippers to continue their evening prayers, Minns has refused to apologise.
After the Town Hall rally on February 9, Dib, a close friend of the premier, posted on social media that the scenes should not have happened, and assured the Muslim community he had met with Minns and the Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon to make their concerns known.
More than a week later, Dib joined Minns at a press conference where he launched a full-throated defence of the premier, denied any rift, and instead heaped blame on protest organisers for failing to heed police advice to hold their protest at Hyde Park.
“There’s no issue between us, and I think it’s really important that we’re so comfortable that we can have those conversations with that pure intent of saying, ‘what can we do to make things better right now and into the future?’” Dib said.
A senior Labor source, who asked to remain anonymous to speak publicly, said Minns was relying on Dib to calm tensions within his community.
“The ongoing ‘one siding’ and disrespect being shown to the Muslim community is really out of control and Minns’ use of Jihad Dib as a human shield this week has been unedifying,” the source says. “Cabinet ministers from both the Right and the Left seem to have no capacity to challenge the premier or put forward new policies and that is leading to every position being decided by what 2GB shock jocks would say about it.”
Senior Labor figures with an understanding of the operations of the Minns government are lamenting the complete control and command centre run out of the premier’s office. There, Minns makes all the decisions without challenge, enforced by his trusted lieutenant James Cullen, a long-serving Labor staffer.
In the competitive world of politics, where ministers want to retain their cabinet spot or MPs desperately hope to be promoted, it appears no one wants to rock the boat. Some MPs in the Left faction who marched across the Harbour Bridge last year have been in lock-step with the premier after the events of Town Hall.
Former transport minister Jo Haylen, who has been sidelined from cabinet after a travel entitlements scandal, wrote to a constituent insisting that she would continue to fight for the right to protest. She later told this masthead she was disappointed with the protest organisers for not complying with police suggestions to move the rally to Hyde Park.
Unhappiness with Minns’ protest agenda and workers’ compensation reforms will feature at the mid-year NSW Labor state conference, the last before next year’s election. The party leadership will want calm, with no dirty laundry aired, but the delegates are likely to have other ideas.
However, while the dissidents are growing in volume, there are still plenty in the Labor ranks who share the premier’s exasperation with the protests. Health Services Union NSW secretary Gerard Hayes said his members always did their best to avoid disruption to the public when taking to the streets to demand pay rises.
“They know that traffic jams have a real-world consequence and can prevent patients getting to hospital in time,” Hayes said. “Some of the protests we have seen recently don’t share this awareness. The premier has struck the right balance on this issue.”
Still, a growing ensemble of Left-leaning Labor branches are revolting – at least 10 have passed motions after the Town Hall rally showing support for protesters, many calling for an independent investigation and for protest laws to be repealed.
The Australian Services Union is among those expected to push the issue at the upcoming state conference.
“People being kicked and punched and attacks on people peacefully praying indicate that the laws in practice are undermining social cohesion and doing nothing to build unity across the diverse communities of Sydney,” said Angus McFarland, secretary of the Australian Services Union NSW/ACT branch.
“We need laws that strengthen and advance our democracy, not diminish it.”

UN secretary-general: A just peace in Ukraine must fully protect territorial integrity
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has said ahead of the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that any just peace for Ukraine must guarantee the country's territorial integrity.
Source: Guterres in a comment to Ukrinform
Details: Guterres highlighted that over the four years since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, which violated international law, particularly the UN Charter, Ukraine has suffered devastating losses and displacement, attacks on civilians and critical energy infrastructure and serious human rights violations, including those affecting children.
Guterres noted that UN personnel have remained in Ukraine since the start of the war in February 2022, providing life-saving humanitarian assistance wherever it was needed, particularly in frontline areas.
He recalled his visits to Ukraine, where he had witnessed firsthand the destruction caused by the war.
Guterres also welcomed all efforts aimed at achieving a just and inclusive peace.
He emphasised that a just peace in Ukraine must fully ensure the country's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders, in accordance with the UN Charter, international law and the relevant UN resolutions.
Background: Guterres said earlier that the principle of self-determination does not apply to Crimea and Donbas and that Ukraine's territorial integrity takes precedence, amid reports that Russia had asked the United Nations to consider "self-determination" for these territories.

Moment fake animal rehoming centre owner who abused pets in his care is arrested by police
This is the moment an fake animal rescue centre owner who abused pets in his care was arrested.
Oaveed Rahman, 26, purported to be looking after the animals at a rehoming centre called Save A Paw in Crays Hill, Billericay, Essex. Instead, he left them to suffer in filthy conditions amongst the caracasses of other dogs.
He took about £4,800 from his 11 victims, telling them it would be used to rehome dogs, provide a new kennel block or train dogs to behave around children and other animals.
Essex Police found 37 dead dogs when they first searched the rehoming centre in May, 2025. Four more dead dogs were found after the property was demolished.
“Many animals taken in by you… were subjected to prolonged barbaric mistreatment, cruelty and neglect,” Judge Conley said.
On Friday (20 February), Rahman, of Hope Road, Crays Hills, was jailed for a total of five years and given a lifetime order banning him from owning any animals.

North Carolina fire that killed Denny Hamlin’s father ruled accidental; exact cause still unknown
Investigators have ruled as accidental the North Carolina house fire in December that killed NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin’s father and injured his mother, but the exact cause remains unclear

The North Carolina house fire that killed the father of NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin and injured his mother has been ruled accidental but it's still unclear what started it.
A report released by Gaston County Emergency Management & Fire Services said the Dec. 28 fire at the two-story home originated in a bedroom, but the “cause of ignition” is “undetermined.”
Otherwise, the investigation determined the fire as accidental, Gaston County spokesperson Adam Gaub wrote in an email Friday.
Dennis Hamlin, 75, and Mary Lou Hamlin, 69, were found outside the home the evening of the fire suffering from catastrophic injuries, officials said. Dennis Hamlin later died, while his wife survived.
The home, located near Stanley about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Charlotte, was owned by a company that listed Denny Hamlin as its manager, according to government records.
Dennis Hamlin was already seriously ill last year, his son previously said.
Denny Hamlin is a leading driver in NASCAR’s top circuit, having won 60 NASCAR Cup Series races, including the Daytona 500 three times. Hamlin and Michael Jordan co-own the car driven by Tyler Reddick that won this year's Daytona 500 last weekend.

According to Ukrinform, the State Statistics Service announced the figures on Facebook.
The agency noted that the agricultural production index across all household categories reached 103.2% of the previous year’s level, driven primarily by livestock output. Production at enterprises rose by 11.9% (index 111.9%), while output in household farms declined by 15% (index 85%).
Among regions, the strongest growth was recorded in Vinnytsia (122.9%) and Lviv (122.7%) regions. Significant increases were also observed in Kirovohrad (107.6%), Khmelnytskyi (107.4%), and Kyiv (107.3%) regions.
By contrast, the weakest performance was seen in Donetsk (60.5%), Zakarpattia (68.3%), and Chernivtsi (82.9%) regions.

Officials investigate deadly California avalanche for possible criminal negligence

Authorities are investigating whether any criminal negligence was involved in the deadly avalanche that swept California’s Lake Tahoe this week, which killed at least eight skiers and their guides while returning from a three-day backcountry skiing trip.
The Nevada county sheriff’s office said on Friday said that they notified the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha), which regulates workplace safety, of the active investigation.
“We are investigating the incident to determine if there were any factors that would be considered criminal negligence,” said a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office. “It is too early to know if criminal charges will be applicable, as the investigation is preliminary and remains active and ongoing. The district attorney’s office would ultimately be the determining authority for any criminal charges to be filed.”
The avalanche, the deadliest in California’s modern history, killed at least eight people and a ninth skier is still missing but is presumed dead.
Blackbird Mountain Guides, which employed the ski guides that led the trek, said in a statement released on Wednesday that three of their workers died after the avalanche, and one of them survived.
“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,” said Zeb Blais, founder of Blackbird Mountain Guides, in the statement. “We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much, and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.
“There is still a lot that we’re learning about what happened. It’s too soon to draw conclusions, but investigations are underway,” Blais added in Wednesday’s statement.
As the 15 skiers were coming back from their trip, which started on Sunday, avalanche warnings were already in place. Blackbird Mountain Guides seemed to be aware of the hazardous weather conditions, according to a social media video posted on Sunday.
During a press conference on Wednesday, Shannan Moon, Nevada county’s sheriff, said that the investigation includes learning why the ski trip was not cancelled.
“Those are the decisions that the guide company clearly had made,” Moon said. “We’re still in conversation with them on the decision factors that they made.”
Six of the 15 skiers survived and were rescued, including the fourth guide. Amid hazardous weather conditions, the avalanche victims have not yet been extracted from the mountain.
“Adverse weather, coupled with ongoing avalanche danger, has hindered the recovery process,” a statement released on Friday by the Nevada county sheriff’s office said. A statement released on Thursday said “until the recovery mission is completed, the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office is unable to confirm the identifications, ages, affiliations, or cities of origin for the victims.”
Family members have confirmed the identities of six of the eight people who died in Tuesday’s avalanche. The identified victims – Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt – were part of a group which frequently went on ski trips together.
The sheriff’s office also announced that avalanche mitigation was under way in California’s Sierra Nevada on Friday, consisting of controlled “explosive deployment to intentionally release unstable snowpack”. These measures aim to reduce avalanche risk and improve first responder safety as they recover victims.

Another American citizen was shot dead by ICE months before deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, records show
Ruben Ray Martinez was killed during a traffic stop on South Padre Island in Texas last March, according to newly released documents

An American citizen was shot dead by Immigration and Customs Enforcement months before the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota, records have shown.
Ruben Ray Martinez was killed during a traffic stop on South Padre Island in Texas last March, several outlets, citing documents obtained by nonprofit watchdog American Oversight, reported.
Martinez had just turned 23, and he and his best friend were driving from San Antonio to South Padre Island to celebrate, his mother, Rachel Reyes, told the Associated Press.
Shortly after midnight on March 15, 2025, a driver, confirmed by family to be Martinez, and a passenger in a blue Ford were passing through an intersection where Homeland Security Investigations officers had been helping South Padre Island police redirect traffic after an accident, according to an internal ICE incident report included in the new release of documents.
Reyes confirmed to the Associated Press that the victim in the report was her son, and Charles Stam, a lawyer for Martinez’s family, also confirmed Martinez was the one killed to The New York Times.
Agents surrounded Martinez’s car and ordered him and the passenger to get out, according to the report. Martinez “accelerated forward” and hit an HSI special agent, “who wound up on the hood of the vehicle,” the report said.
An HSI supervisory special agent then fired multiple times through the open driver’s side window, according to the report.
Martinez was taken to a hospital and later died, the report said. The HSI agent hit by the car was treated for a knee injury, according to the report.
“It was his first time getting to go out of town,” Reyes said of her son. “He was a nice guy, humble guy. And he wasn’t a violent person at all.”
It’s unclear why Martinez was stopped in the first place.
Without confirming the identity of the victim, the Department of Homeland Security said a federal agent had fatally shot a man that day in March to “protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public.”
“A driver of a blue Ford intentionally ran over a Homeland Security Investigation special agent resulting in him being on the hood of the vehicle. Upon witnessing this, another agent fired defensive shots to protect himself, his fellow agents, and the general public,” a DHS spokesperson told The Independent. “This incident is under active investigation by the Texas Department of Public Safety Ranger Division.”
According to the Associated Press, Martinez’s death is one of at least six fatal shootings by federal immigration agents since the start of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, which has grown increasingly unpopular.
The Trump administration sparked nationwide backlash over the deaths of Good, a mom of three, and Pretti, an ICU nurse. Both were gunned down by federal agents in the streets of Minneapolis last month. Both were 37-year-old U.S. citizens.
Both shootings have been framed by the Trump administration as self-defense, a claim that has been scrutinized.
A new Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, while just 38 percent approve, the lowest level since the president returned to the White House.

Settlers said to shoot Palestinians, rob homes, commit arson in pair of Ramallah-area attacks
Two young men were hospitalized with gunshot wounds this afternoon after settlers attacked the Palestinian compound of Abu Hamam, on the outskirts of the Ramallah-area town of al-Mughayyir, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society.
One young woman from the compound, interviewed by the Hamas-affiliated Quds News Network at the hospital in al-Mughayyir, says a settler named Moshe punched her in the face, knocked her down and kicked her, with her small daughter by her side.
“They were beating us and shooting us,” she says. “I hid my father behind me. I said, let them beat me and not him.”
In separate footage she filmed from the compound, the same woman says the settlers robbed homes there.
“They left nothing,” she says. “But thank God, we’re okay.”

Trump leaning toward attacking Iran, deadline of 10-15 days said ‘not scientific’ — report
US President Donald Trump is leaning toward attacking Iran but will wait a matter of days for a response to his demands from the Iranians, Channel 12 reports.
The report says the US president is acceding to a request from his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to give Iran another day or two to offer a response. The US and Iran are in the midst of negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program, with the US demanding that the Islamic Republic stop all nuclear enrichment. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran since its deadly crackdown on anti-regime protests last month, and has amassed US forces in the region.
The network quotes an unnamed US official as saying the deadline Trump previously gave Iran for a response, of 10 to 15 days, is “not scientific.”
The network goes on to repeat an Axios report from late yesterday saying that, despite US demands of “zero enrichment” in Iran, Trump might be open to allowing “token” enrichment, leaving a narrow pathway for a deal.
“We will see what he gives us in writing. Based on that, we will see how serious they are. The ball is in their court,” a US official told Axios.
The Axios report also said Trump is weighing a plan to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his son and potential heir.
Trump is keeping his options open. He could decide on an attack at any moment,” a senior Trump adviser told Axios.
Female IDF sergeant indicted for abusing two soldiers as part of ‘hazing ritual’
A female sergeant in the IDF Artillery Corps was recently indicted for abusing two corporals in her unit as part of a so-called hazing ritual.
Details of the indictment were first reported by the Ynet news site this evening and subsequently confirmed by the military.
According to the indictment, the alleged acts of abuse began in November when the two younger female soldiers completed their training and joined the artillery battalion in which the sergeant served.
The sergeant is accused of abusing the two corporals as a form of “punishment” for minor infractions, summoning them at night, whipping them with her dog tag, striking them with her rifle, and forcing them to sing, despite their pleas for the actions to stop.
The alleged assault lasted about 15 minutes, causing the junior soldiers bruising and pain, and ended with the sergeant telling them to continue the “tradition” with future recruits, according to Ynet.
In response to a query, the IDF says that a military court accepted the prosecution’s request to extend the remand of the sergeant until February 26.
“With the consent of the parties, a mediation process in the case is expected to take place,” the army says.
The IDF says that the battalion commander convened all of the battalion’s soldiers following the incident for a discussion on the matter, “during which the boundaries of what is permitted and prohibited were clarified, and the IDF’s values and the norms expected of all service members were reinforced.”
“The IDF views acts of abuse of any kind gravely, as they are contrary to the law and violate IDF values, and will act to fully prosecute any soldier or commander found to be involved in them,” the military adds.
There have been incidents of so-called hazing in the IDF in the past, and they have generally taken place in infantry and commando units.
Syrian government takes over management of airport held by Kurds
Syrian authorities have taken over management of Qamishli airport as part of an ongoing process to integrate Kurdish-led forces and institutions into the national government, state media reports.
The SANA news agency, citing the General Authority of Civil Aviation and Air Transport, says officials toured the facility today after assuming control and “discussed mechanisms to restart its operations.”
The head of the authority, Omar al-Husari, says on X that taking over the airport is “an important institutional step in the process of unifying the management of airports under the umbrella of the state.”
The Kurds — who controlled much of northeast Syria before striking the integration deal under military pressure from the government — had taken over the airport following the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.
While it was not open to civilian flights, Russia had used part of the facility as a base before withdrawing last month.
Qamishli is the only airport in northeastern Syria, and for years served as a lifeline for the region’s residents, particularly during nearly 14 years of civil war beginning in 2011, during which there were regular flights between it and Damascus.
The airport had remained under the government’s control during the war, and continued to receive flights up until Assad’s overthrow.
Italian broadcaster apologizes after commentator calls to ‘avoid’ Israeli Olympic bobsleigh team
Italy’s RAI public broadcaster apologizes after a commentator suggested on-air that they “avoid” any discussion of Israel’s Olympic bobsleigh team.
In a comment made off-camera earlier today ahead of the four-man bobsleigh event in Cortina, an Italian commentator says, “Let’s avoid crew 21, which is Israeli.” It is not clear if the remark was a “hot mic” comment not meant to air, or if the commentator intended to say it during the broadcast.
Marco Lollobrigida, the interim director of RAI Sport, issues a statement apologizing and promising to investigate the incident.
“The off-air remark that was broadcast before the four-man bobsleigh race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on RAI 2 contained an unacceptable expression that in no way represents the values of public service broadcasting or of RAI Sport,” says Lollobrigida. “On behalf of the directorate, I extend sincere apologies to the Israeli athletes, the delegation, and all viewers. Immediate internal reviews have been launched to determine responsibility. Sport must unite, not divide.”
Giampaolo Rossi, the managing director of RAI, also issues an apology, saying that the incident runs “contrary to the principles of impartiality, respect and inclusion that must characterize public service broadcasting,” adding that a probe will be “aimed at initiating disciplinary proceedings.”
Last week, during the two-man bobsleigh team’s run, a Swiss commentator came under fire for using the entirety of the team’s run to berate captain AJ Edelman’s support of Zionism and Israel, and question if he should have been allowed to compete at the Olympics at all. Swiss broadcaster RTS later pulled the clip from its digital platforms, saying that while the commentary was “factual,” its “length” was not appropriate for a sporting event.
After the four-man bobsleigh team’s first two heats earlier today, Israel is in 24th place out of the 27 teams, after three of them crashed mid-course and did not finish the race. The final two heats will be held tomorrow.
FIFA boss’s Board of Peace appearance doesn’t violate political neutrality, IOC says
FIFA President Gianni Infantino’s presence at the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace this week, alongside heads of state and politicians, does not violate any Olympic Charter rules on political neutrality, the International Olympic Committee says.
The boss of global soccer’s governing body, who is also an IOC member, took part in Thursday’s meeting of the Board of Peace, which was set up to oversee postwar Gaza but whose mandate Trump has expanded to resolve other global conflicts, raising concerns that it could rival the United Nations.
“The IOC has been in contact with FIFA,” an IOC spokesperson says. “We understand that FIFA is supporting, through football, a comprehensive sport recovery investment program in Gaza, Palestine, by providing sporting infrastructure, education and elite development proposals.”
“This is entirely in keeping with the role of an international sport federation. The IOC, through Olympic Solidarity, which is our development vehicle, has been and continues to support sport development in the region,” the spokesperson says.
The Olympic Charter states that members must always act independently of commercial and political interests. They also cannot accept “from governments, organisations, or other parties, any mandate or instructions liable to interfere with the freedom of their action and vote,” the Charter says.
Infantino appeared on stage with several heads of state, sported a red hat with ‘USA’ on the front and the numbers 45-47, representing the two non-consecutive presidencies of Trump.
Infantino also displayed the FIFA collaboration agreement with The Board of Peace, which includes building 50 mini-pitches near schools and residential areas in Gaza, five full-size pitches across multiple districts, a state-of-the-art FIFA academy, and a new 20,000-seat national stadium.
The US President was also awarded FIFA’s inaugural peace prize in December.
Trump says he will raise US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%
US President Donald Trump says he will raise from 10 percent to 15% a temporary tariff rate on US imports from all countries, which he imposed after the US Supreme Court ruled against his signature tariff program based on an economic emergency law.
Infuriated by the high court’s ruling, Trump yesterday ordered an immediate 10% tariff on all imports, in addition to any existing tariffs. The law allows him to impose a levy of up to 15% for 150 days, although it could face legal challenges.
During that period, his administration will work on issuing new and “legally permissible” tariffs, he said.
Israel’s US tariff rate of 15% took effect in August.
“I, as President of the United States of America, will be, effective immediately, raising the 10% Worldwide Tariff on Countries, many of which have been ‘ripping’ the US off for decades, without retribution (until I came along!), to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level,” he writes in a social media post.
Report: Iran’s IRGC is currently running Hezbollah, preparing it for war with Israel, US
Sources close to Hezbollah are cited by Saudi outlet Al-Arabiya as saying that the Iran-backed Lebanese group has been effectively taken over by officers from Tehran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as Iran prepares for a war with the US and Israel.
The IRGC officers, some of whom recently arrived in Lebanon from Iran, are tasked with rebuilding Hezbollah’s military capabilities and have been personally briefing Hezbollah fighters across Lebanon, according to the sources.
They add that IRGC officers were meeting with members of Hezbollah’s missile unit at a site in Lebanon’s Beqaa Valley that was bombed by Israel last night, amid a wave of airstrikes that wounded at least 50 people and killed 12, including a senior Hezbollah officer, targeting what the IDF said were Hamas and Hezbollah command centers in Lebanon.
A wider Israeli military offensive against Hezbollah is only a matter of time, say the Hezbollah-aligned sources.
Meanwhile, anti-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet Nidaa al-Watan cites “prominent political sources” in the country as saying Beirut must declare its neutrality in case of a US-Iran war, and refuse to let Hezbollah drag Lebanon into war with Israel.
The Ynet news site reported this week that Iran was pressuring Hezbollah to fight alongside it in the event of a war with Israel.
Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem last month said the group would not be neutral in the event of a war, but stopped short of explicitly threatening Israel.
Arab League, Muslim nations condemn Huckabee for ‘Greater Israel’ comments in Carlson interview
The Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation both issue statements condemning recent comments made by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee as “extreme,” “unacceptable” and “a violation of international law and norms.
The statements from the two organizations refer to comments made by Huckabee during his contentious interview with right-wing American commentator Tucker Carlson that aired yesterday, in which he remarked that “it would be fine” if Israel took over so-called Greater Israel, which includes parts of several Arab and Muslim countries. Huckabee then backtracked and said the comment was made hyperbolically.
In its statement, the Arab League condemns Huckabee’s “extreme” comment, in which he “asserted Israel’s right to control the Middle East, citing religious texts from the Old Testament.”
The comments “violated all the basic principles and established norms of diplomacy, as well as defying logic and reason,” the group of 22 Arab nations says, adding that the US envoy’s words “contradict US policies and positions across the board, aimed at currying favor with the right-wing public in Israel.”
“Such extremist and baseless statements inflame religious and nationalistic sentiments at a time when Arab states are meeting under the auspices of the Board of Peace to discuss ways to implement the Gaza peace agreement and seize this opportunity to launch a serious peace process,” it adds.

The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which is made up of 57 mostly Muslim-majority nations, including the entire Arab League, issues a similar statement, saying it “condemns the dangerous and irresponsible” comments made by Huckabee.
The OIC says the US envoy’s comments were “an unacceptable call for the expansion of Israel” that were “based on a false and rejected historical and ideological narrative.”
Such remarks “fuel extremist ideological rhetoric would fuel extremism and encourage” Israel to ” continue its illegal measures based on displacement, settlement, and attempts to impose annexation” on Palestinian territory, the group says.

Huckabee, a devout Christian, made the comment after being pressed by the Carlson on his assertion that a part of the Jewish people’s right to the land stemmed from God’s promise to Abraham, while noting that that promised land spanned a far larger territory than that of today’s Israel, encompassing much of present-day’s Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He asked whether it did not follow then that Israel had a right to take land from neighboring Arab countries.
After initially avoiding the matter, Huckabee eventually said, “It would be fine if they took it all,” while swiftly adding that this was not on the table as “They’re not asking to take it over.”
Carlson then asked the US ambassador to confirm he was fine with Israel taking over “all of Syria, all of Lebanon.” Huckabee responded, “That’s really not exactly what I’m trying to say,” adding that “It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement.”
In a subsequent back-and-forth, Carlson demanded to know whether Huckabee believes Israel “has a moral right to take over what are now other people’s countries,” as the envoy insisted he had not said that. Eventually, Huckabee said: “If they end up getting attacked by all these places and they win that war and they take that land, then, okay, that’s a whole other discussion.”
Hezbollah official says only choice is ‘resistance’ after Israeli strike kills 8 operatives
Senior Hezbollah political leader and Lebanese parliament member Mahmoud Qamati says that the group’s only choice is “resistance” after an Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon killed eight of the group’s operatives a day before.
“What happened yesterday in the Beqaa is a new massacre and a new aggression, exceeding all the previous levels of aggression against Lebanon,” Qamati says in a speech broadcast by Hezbollah’s Al-Manar network during a protest in Beirut.
“What option do we have left to defend ourselves and our country? What option do we have other than resistance? We no longer have any [other] option.”
The strike in the Beqaa Valley killed eight Hezbollah operatives, including one described as a “commander,” the group said earlier today.
The IDF said the strikes targeted three command centers belonging to Hezbollah’s missile array, killing a “large number” of operatives. According to Lebanese media, the strikes killed at least 10 and wounded over 50.

The IDF struck and killed several Hezbollah missile array terrorists in an attack in Baalbek, Lebanon, the military stated in a Saturday release.
Hezbollah leadership said that the three commanders who were killed were identified as Ali Zeid al-Moussawi, Muhammad Ibrahim al-Moussawi, and Hussein Yaghi.
Later on Saturday, the Associated Press reported that the IDF killed eight Hezbollah terrorists in the village of Rayak in northeast Lebanon on Friday.
Saudi channel al-Hadath reported that the strike targeted a commander's meeting, while initial Arab media reports suggested that an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander was the target.
The Jerusalem Post could not verify the claims by Arab media reports regarding the presence of IRGC commanders at the meeting.
The Lebanese Health Ministry put the total death toll at 10 people, but did not distinguish between civilians and terrorists.
IDF strikes Hamas, Hezbollah command centers
The IDF said in its statement that the attack on Baalbek targeted a command center “embedded within the civilian population, in violation of the ceasefire understandings, and while cynically exploiting the civilian population as human shields to advance terror attacks.”
The military also targeted a Hamas command center in southern Lebanon on Friday, which was being used as a command and control center and a training facility for Hamas terrorists.
According to the IDF, the infrastructure targeted was also embedded among the civilian population, which constituted a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon.
IDF kills terrorist who crossed Yellow Line in Gaza
Also on Saturday, the IDF announced that it killed a terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line in Gaza.
The IDF noted that the terrorist posed an immediate threat to troops and that it would "continue to operate to remove any immediate threat."

FBI arrests three Silicon Valley engineers suspected of leaking Google, technology secrets to Iran

The United States Department of Justice announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested three Silicon Valley engineers who are suspected of leaking trade secrets from Google and other leading technology companies to Iran and other foreign entities early on Friday.
A federal indictment accused Samaneh Ghandali, her sister Sorour Ghandali, and her husband Mohammad Javad Khosravi of conspiring to commit trade secret theft, attempted trade secret theft, and obstruction of justice.
According to the indictment, Samaneh Ghandali, who previously worked for Google and later moved to another technology company, and Khosravi, who worked at a separate tech company, used their positions to gain access to confidential and sensitive information.
They then allegedly copied and transferred documents containing trade secrets related to processor security, cryptography, and other technologies to personal locations and third parties, including Iran.
Investigators claim that to conceal their actions, files and records were destroyed, methods were employed to evade detection, including manually photographing computer screens, and false affidavits were submitted to the affected companies.
Ghandali, Khosravi accessed trade secrets while in Iran
In August 2023, Google’s security systems identified Samaneh Ghandali conducting unusual activity and revoked her access to company resources. She then allegedly signed an affidavit claiming that she had not shared any confidential information with anyone outside of Google.
Despite the restriction, Ghandali and her husband allegedly continued attempts to retain confidential information, sought ways to delete communications, and photographed hundreds of screens containing sensitive information from Google and the unnamed company.
In December 2023, Samaneh Ghandali and Khosravi took multiple photographs of confidential information displayed on Khosravi’s company computer screen. The two travelled to Iran the next day and used a personal device associated with Samaneh Ghandali to access the photos and other information related to trade secrets.
The three defendants are scheduled to appear in court on Saturday.

Artificial intelligence: A tool for engineering consciousness or a healing aid?- opinion

Not so long ago, the public knew who was shaping its opinions. These were newspapers, editors, news anchors, and broadcasters. One could agree or disagree with them, but at least it was clear where influence was concentrated. Today, part of that power center has shifted to an invisible system: algorithms. Human editors no longer decide what we see; mathematical formulas do, designed to maximize emotion, screen time, and profit.
Social networks initially promised a revolution of freedom. Anyone could speak, publish, and influence. In practice, they have produced a system more centralized than any printed newspaper. A handful of technology companies now wield unprecedented power to shape consciousness. The algorithm does not ask what is important to know, but what will keep us engaged. And what keeps us engaged is often anger, fear, and polarization.
This has created an economy of emotion. Moderate content rarely survives. By contrast, sensational headlines, conspiracy theories, and extreme videos are rewarded with broad distribution. The algorithm is not ideological; it is indifferent to truth. It rewards engagement.
The result, however, is a public sphere in which truth struggles to hold its ground against sophisticated emotional manipulation.
The problem is not only lies. The problem is that each user receives a personalized reality. Two citizens in the same country may inhabit entirely different information worlds. This is no longer a political disagreement; it is the disintegration of a shared language. Democracy relies on agreed-upon basic facts. Without shared facts, there is no foundation for public discourse.
Moreover, the algorithm learns us better than we know ourselves. It knows when we are tired, when we are vulnerable, and what triggers us emotionally. This information is used for advertising and for political influence. Modern campaigns are not aimed at the public, but at the individual. Each person receives a different message. This is personalized politics, nearly impossible to oversee.
How algorithms amplify outrage
Here lies the paradox: Never has information been so available, and never has it been so difficult to know what is true. Information overload creates cognitive fatigue. The public is pushed toward simplification and empty slogans. The algorithm does not merely reflect polarization; it amplifies it. It learns that outrage performs better than discussion, and so it serves us more of it.
Today, social movements are all influenced by code written in Silicon Valley. Technology companies claim neutrality, but algorithmic neutrality is a myth. Every programming choice is also a value choice: what to promote, what to hide, and what to measure as success.
The solution is not government censorship. Transparency is a necessary condition. The public must know how the mechanisms that shape its consciousness operate. Smart regulation can enforce accountability without suffocating freedom of expression.
In a cynical world where artificial intelligence is often used to spread lies and manipulate video and audio to create chaos and despair, there is another use, one that seeks to help build a better world, across borders: the use of AI for emotional support.
AI for emotional support
In the United States and Israel, a group of scientists, some of them Israeli, from MIT, has for the first time developed a unique system designed to assist people suffering from post-traumatic stress and anxiety, including soldiers returning from combat zones and civilians exposed to extreme events.
The system, called MyWave, is available as a desktop app or a mobile app. It offers an advanced integration of artificial intelligence with real-time physiological metrics. At its core is a repository of calming music, including tracks uploaded by singers and artists, which users can access instantly whenever needed.
The system’s uniqueness is not limited to music. The app connects to a smartwatch or ring that collects physiological data, including stress levels, heart rate, sleep patterns, blood pressure, ECG readings, and oxygen saturation. These are combined with vocal analysis while the user speaks into the app’s microphone.
As users express their emotions, the AI gradually learns to recognize their patterns, triggers for anger, mood fluctuations, and emotional responses. Based on this data, it selects precise musical frequencies designed to calm and restore emotional balance.
In the initial stages, use of the system is supervised by a psychologist, either in a group setting or individually, to ensure professional oversight. After an adjustment period, users can rely on it independently at home, even late at night, when anxiety arises, and no professional is available. In such moments, a phone and headphones become an immediate, accessible support tool.
The system has already been tested at a university in Boca Raton, Florida, as well as in Israel among trauma and anxiety patients. Meetings with senior figures in Israel’s health care system, including psychologists and psychiatrists, have shown strong interest in the therapeutic potential and the novelty of an approach unlike any used before.
One particularly harrowing case involves a soldier from an elite unit in Jerusalem who experienced severe trauma: His partner was shot and killed before his eyes, and he himself was wounded. Despite professional psychological treatment, he was unable to sleep. The trauma was profound. After several sessions using the MyWave app and its music, his anxiety threshold dropped significantly, allowing him to sleep.
Development of the system is expected to continue for several more months, after which it is slated to become available to hospitals and medical centers treating post-traumatic stress and anxiety disorders. MyWave may mark a breakthrough in trauma treatment.
The combination of advanced technology, music, and human emotion offers new hope to thousands of patients. According to published reports, more than 50,000 soldiers from the first circle alone were affected by the October 7 events.
The project is led under the guidance of Dr. Yaron Seidman of Florida, together with Jay Buck, a Jewish philanthropist and supporter of Israel, Steve Benedetti, and senior figures from Wall Street. The initiative will be offered free of charge to hospitals, rehabilitation centers for wounded veterans, and government institutions treating anxiety and trauma patients, as a contribution to the State of Israel.
The author is the CEO of Radio's 100FM, an honorary consul and vice dean of the consular Diplomatic corps, president of the Israel Radio Communication Association, and a former Israel Defense Forces Radio correspondent and NBC television correspondent.

2026 Winter Olympics: US freeskier Ferreira wins halfpipe gold

US freestyle skier Alex Ferreira won gold on Friday, February 20, to complete his set of Olympic medals, soaring to victory in a men's halfpipe final littered with errors.
Ferreira, who already had a silver and bronze in his collection, posted a winning score of 93.75 after a sublime effort on his third and final run of the competition under the lights in Livigno. He dislodged Henry Sildaru from top spot, but the Estonian's silver was still his country's first medal of the Milan-Cortina Games.
Canada's Brendan Mackay took bronze with a best score of 91.00.
"I'm finally in the history books, at least in my eyes," said Ferreira. "I would still be the same person with or without the medal, but it sure does feel good around my neck."
"They certainly didn't give it to me easy," the 31-year-old added. "I had to keep working. If they had given it to me in 2018, who knows if I would be here tonight. The universe has a weird way of working itself out."
The final, featuring 11 competitors, started in bizarre fashion with Canada's Andrew Longino the only athlete able to put down a reasonable score of 76.50 in the first run.
The pattern of mishaps continued at the start of run two but the event changed complexion when Ferreira posted 90.50 to set a new standard. That was immediately topped by Sildaru, who scored 92.75. But Ferreira found an extra gear on his final run and the Estonian teenager fell agonizingly short with a 93.00, forcing him to settle for second place.
Ferreira won halfpipe silver at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and followed up with bronze in Beijing four years later.
US skier Hunter Hess, who was labeled a "loser" by President Donald Trump for saying he had mixed feelings about representing America in the current political climate, finished in 10th spot. Speaking after the qualifiers earlier on Friday, Hess said he was embracing the label and that the furor had boosted his motivation.
New Zealand's world champion Finley Melville Ives suffered a hard fall in the qualifiers that put him out of contention for the final. It was the second serious incident in two days in the discipline after Cassie Sharpe's crash during the women's halfpipe qualifying.
New Zealand's Olympic team said Melville Ives was "stable and positive" following his tumble.
The halfpipe event carries a high level of risk as skiers must perform a series of aerial tricks by propelling themselves off the edge of a semi-cylindrical course. The inner height of the walls is 7.2 meters and the athletes soar high above the lip of the half-pipe.

After the U.S. Supreme Court struck down his sweeping global tariffs in a 6-3 ruling, President Trump denounced the decision as a "disgrace to our nation" and called the justices in the majority "very unpatriotic and disloyal to the Constitution," suggesting they had been "swayed by foreign interests." Undeterred, Trump quickly announced a new 10% global tariff, this time invoking a different trade law. The move potentially sets him on a collision course with Congress. On the question of refunds for tariffs already collected, estimated at up to $175 billion, the court's ruling was silent, leaving that question unresolved. Trump warned the process could be prolonged, saying the U.S. may be tied up in litigation for years.

Winter is coming, and Qld’s new top doctor has set her sights on shielding the state

Winter is coming, and Qld’s new top doctor has set her sights on shielding the state
Dr Marianne Gale hopes to achieve many things as Queensland’s next chief health officer, but as she begins her first year in the role, one takes precedence.
“Immunisation is clearly a priority for me,” she says from her new office in the Queensland government building on Charlotte Street in Brisbane’s CBD.
“Globally and across Australia, people have exhibited some degree of vaccination fatigue, and I understand that, but it’s also important that we don’t forget, and don’t lose appreciation for, how important vaccination is.”
The 44-year-old doctor has her work cut out for her.
Last year, Queensland experienced its worst flu season in a decade, with more than 95,000 cases recorded. Experts said the spike was driven in part by low vaccination rates, with Queensland’s uptake of 28 per cent the worst in the country.
While there were other contributing factors, including the emergence of a mutant strain of influenza, confusing political messaging was also blamed.
As flu cases spiked across the state in August, causing ambulance ramping rates to climb and forcing pauses on elective surgery, Premier David Crisafulli and Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie refused to answer questions about whether they had been vaccinated, and they skirted suggestions to encourage people to get the vaccine.
Gale says the government’s renewal of the free flu vaccination program and the introduction of needle-free nasal spray for children this year sends a strong signal about their support for immunisation, and she wants to see the “numbers come right down” this season.
She adds that she’s keen to listen to communities and families concerned about vaccination safety and efficacy, and underline the importance of making informed health decisions.
“I think the majority of people just want to do the right thing for themselves, and they want to make the right choice for their child … [and] for the people they love.
“It’s important that when people are seeking information about vaccines, they seek it from trusted sources, from people who actually know about the issues they’re going to discuss.”
Gale’s experience more than qualifies her to helm public messaging on immunisation programs and disease outbreaks – hallmarks of her role as chief health officer.
Born in Singapore, she migrated to Townsville in the early ’80s, returning after medical school to work as a junior doctor in the far north city’s major public hospital.
“As a young doctor, you get exposed to a lot more things [in a regional hospital], and there’s greater opportunity to learn,” she says.
The next chapter of her career was devoted to working with some of the world’s most disadvantaged communities, spending five years as a field doctor with Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders.
In her first year, she helped refugees in Myanmar on the Thai border before travelling to West Africa, South America and throughout the Asia-Pacific. These roles placed her on the front line of communicable diseases, particularly tuberculosis and HIV.
Gale says she is still passionate about the work – “I think it’s very important to consider how you can support better health outcomes for people whose lives may not be as lucky as your own” – but was ready to return to Australia after five years.
“Working in places where you see young children die from things that are preventable really affects you powerfully,” she says.
“The resilience of people to manage the pain of those situations and to continue with life. It gave me a newfound respect for what human beings can endure and what human beings can do.”
After MSF, Gale joined the NSW Health Ministry, during which time she was thrust into the public spotlight after being promoted to deputy chief health officer alongside Dr Kerry Chant during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It was immensely rewarding … [and an] honour to support the New South Wales population in that role,” she recalls.
“When the opportunity arose to potentially come back to Queensland, a place where I grew up and where I started my career as a doctor … that seemed like a wonderful privilege and an amazing opportunity to do something meaningful with the skills and experience I have.”
Health equity and prevention are also in Gale’s purview as Queensland’s new top doctor.
“[I want] to go and visit around the state and meet communities and talk to frontline clinicians to understand what their issues are, what their priorities are, and how we might be able to work together,” she says.
“I’m looking forward to working with First Nations organisations and communities around Closing the Gap … [and working] again with Queenslanders around how we tackle rising rates of chronic disease, of cancer and dementia, particularly the factors that are preventable.
“It’s critical we think about prevention because it’s going to be necessary to make our hospitals sustainable. And we have to ease the pressure on our acute systems [and our] frontline clinicians.”
Queensland’s last chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, stepped down from the role at the end of his three-year term in December 2024. Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital senior infectious disease specialist Dr Krispin Hajkowicz was scouted to be next in line following an extensive recruitment process, but that decision was abruptly rescinded by the LNP government last year. The matter was referred to the state’s corruption watchdog.
Gale was appointed to the position in October and began as Queensland’s new chief health officer on December 1.

U.S. men's hockey team beats Slovakia 6-2 in Olympic semis, will face Canada in gold medal game
The U.S. men's hockey team rolled past Slovakia in a 6–2 victory Friday, clinching a spot in the Olympic gold medal showdown against Canada. The two sides will face off on Sunday.
Jack Hughes scored two goals, including one with a highlight-reel individual effort. The U.S. had no trouble against the Slovaks, who made an improbable run and were simply overmatched.
It's the first time in 16 years that the U.S. men's hockey team has advanced to the gold medal match.
The last time the U.S. won gold in men's hockey was the "Miracle on Ice" team in the 1980 Winter Olympics, when the U.S. upset the Soviet Union 4–3.
In 2010, the U.S. took silver after losing to Canada in overtime on Sidney Crosby's famous golden goal. Crosby's status is uncertain this time after getting injured in the quarterfinals Wednesday and not playing Friday against Finland.
U.S. center Vincent Trocheck told CBS News winning gold would be "everything that we've all dreamed of since we were kids."
"Watching 'Miracle' growing up, thinking of the 1980 Olympic team, it's just something that, as a kid from the time we're 5 years old, watching that, we've all dreamt of being here, dreamt of winning a gold medal, and we have the opportunity to do that Sunday," Trocheck said.
Winger Brady Tkachuk told CBS News that with the feeling of an entire nation supporting them, "you're not just playing for yourself."
Canada's men's hockey team beat Finland 3-2 in the semifinals on Friday. Finland and Slovakia will play for the bronze on Saturday. Slovakia is looking for just its second hockey medal in the country's history after getting the first with a third-place finish in Beijing in 2022.
A year ago, the U.S. and Canada played two memorable games against each other at the 4 Nations Face-Off.
That NHL-run event ended a drought of nearly a decade without an international tournament featuring the best hockey players in the world. Three fights in the first nine seconds in the first meeting put the 4 Nations in the spotlight, and their epic final won by Canada in overtime only built the anticipation for the Olympics.
The U.S. is playing for gold after the semifinals were a much easier go than the quarterfinals against Sweden, when overtime was needed to survive a scare. Dylan Larkin, Tage Thompson, Hughes and Eichel scored the four goals on 23 shots that chased Samuel Hlavaj out of Slovakia's net past the midway point of the second period.
Thompson, one of just a handful of newcomers who did not play at the 4 Nations, exited later in the second after blocking a shot. He was held out the rest of the way, according to the NBC broadcast.
Hughes got his second just after a power play expired, and Brady Tkachuk scored on a breakaway with just over nine minutes left to provide some more breathing room.
Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck did his job as his teammates outshot Slovakia by a substantial margin. Everything he has done at the Olympics has validated coach Mike Sullivan's decision to go with Hellebuyck as the U.S. starter over Jake Oettinger and Jeremy Swayman.
The U.S. men's win comes one day after the U.S. women's team defeated Canada and won gold in a thrilling 2-1 overtime comeback.
U.S. men's hockey defeated Sweden 2-1 in overtime in its quarterfinal on Wednesday.
In the group stage last weekend, the U.S. beat Denmark 6-3 after overcoming an earlier deficit of 2-1 in the first period. On Feb. 12, the U.S. opened the Olympics by rolling past Latvia 5-1.
It's the first time since 2014 that NHL players have been eligible to compete in the Olympic Games. The league opted out of the Olympic Games in 2022 due to COVID-19, and restricted players in 2018, saying the games would disrupt the NHL season.

Security video captures moment brazen thieves tunnel through California store’s wall and steal $180K worth of Pokémon cards
DOWE Collectibles in North Orange County was ransacked early Wednesday morning by four suspects who are still on the loose, police say

Security video has captured the moment brazen thieves tunneled through a collectibles store’s wall in California and stole $180,000 worth of Pokémon cards, police say.
DOWE Collectibles in North Orange County was ransacked early Wednesday morning by four suspects looking to get their hands on the popular trading cards from the mammoth Japanese media franchise, according to the Anaheim Police Department.
The suspected thieves first broke into a neighboring business, police said.
They then used a sledgehammer to break through the connecting wall and entered the collectibles store through the hole, according to authorities.
Video of the heist was obtained by The Independent and first reported by local outlet KTLA. The store's security cameras appear to show a suspect using a sledgehammer to break into glass cases mounted on walls filled with Pokémon cards.
Another suspect appeared to hastily grab the cards and put them in a garbage bag.
The store’s glass counters also appeared to be raided, according to the video. The suspects then fled the store in a dark-colored sedan.
Duy Pham, the store’s owner, told KTLA that he called police as soon as his phone alerted him to the break-in.
“I clicked on the footage and saw guys coming through the hole,” Pham said. “My heart was pounding.”
Pham said the suspects didn’t target the store’s electronics, adding, “They were here for the cards.”
The store owner said the suspected thieves stole more than 500 cards in a matter of minutes. Some of those cards were worth thousands of dollars each, according to Pham.
In an Instagram post announcing the theft, DOWE Collectibles said its store was “broken into for the second time.”
“To those responsible, sooner or later, you will be held accountable,” the post read.
Anaheim police are yet to catch the suspects as of Friday afternoon, but tell The Independent they are following up on some leads.
The Pokémon franchise has soared in popularity since Nintendo released the first Pokémon video games, Pokémon Red and Pokémon Green, in Japan in 1996.
A 1st edition 1999 Pokémon card of the famed character Charizard is going for just under $600,000 on eBay. It was in 49 buyers’ carts Friday afternoon.

Man arrested at Waffle House after killing two people in front of young children will spend rest of his life in jail, prosecutors say
Prosecutors said Charles Saunders and the victims had been arguing in the days leading up to the killings
- Bookmark
What began as an argument inside a South Carolina apartment complex ended in gunfire, leaving two people dead and an arrest hours later at a Waffle House.
Charles Saunders, 50, of New York, will spend the rest of his life in prison for fatally shooting Alesia Dykes and Bernard Alexander Lyles in front of children at the Walsh Drive Apartments in Hardeeville, prosecutors announced Thursday.
Prosecutors said Saunders and the two victims had been arguing in the days leading up to the shooting on June 18, 2024.
Saunders and Dykes had been friends years earlier in New York. Dykes later introduced Saunders to her sister, with whom he had a son. Saunders had traveled to South Carolina after learning his son had a child and had been staying with Dykes at the time of the shooting, prosecutors said.
Shortly after noon on the day of the shooting, Hardeeville Police responded to the apartment complex where witnesses told investigators that Saunders and the two victims had been arguing.
When the confrontation escalated, Dykes and Lyles attempted to retreat inside the apartment. Prosecutors said Saunders stepped into the doorway, pulled a handgun from his waistband and opened fire.
Three young children were inside the apartment at the time of the shooting. One child ran to a nearby relative’s home to get help.
Dykes was pronounced dead at the scene. Lyles was transported to Coastal Carolina Hospital, where he later died.
Saunders fled the area. Investigators later recovered a shirt he discarded in a trash can on Main Street. Forensic testing revealed gunshot residue on the clothing.
Several hours after the shooting, Saunders was arrested at a Waffle House in Ridgeland.
On Thursday, Saunders was found guilty of two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. He was sentenced to life in prison.
“[Saunders] chose to repay trust and hospitality with violence of the most horrendous sort,” said Trasi Campbell of the 14th Circuit Solicitor’s Office, who prosecuted the case.
“Charles Saunders has lived a life of violence, and today’s outcome ensures he no longer endangers the public.”

Rupert Murdoch’s second wife and glamorous mainstay, Anna, had incalculable influence

Rupert Murdoch’s second wife and glamorous mainstay, Anna, had incalculable influence
ANNA MURDOCH MANN DEPEYSTER: 1944–2026
For three decades – as long as her husband’s next three marriages combined – Anna Murdoch was the steady, steely, serene, quietly long-suffering, glamorous mainstay and support of her husband, Rupert, as he strove to become a global media titan.
It could not be said that she was always at his side, as she had wished – his restless globetrotting and vaulting ambition made this impossible. This may have contributed to the end of their 31-year marriage in 1999.
Despite Mrs Murdoch’s involuntary exit some months later from the parent board of News Corporation, her role and relationship as mother of their three children – Elisabeth, Lachlan and James – and Rupert’s first child, Prudence, remained undimmed. She ensured that their stake in the empire was undiluted. Given Murdoch had so few intimates and fewer confidants, Anna’s influence, on the corporation and its leadership, and as a wife and mother, is incalculable.
Yet, apart from some Scottish heritage, Anna Maria Torv’s beginnings were starkly different from those of her first husband’s. Rupert’s father, Keith, was a national figure (knighted when Rupert was two), while his mother, Elisabeth Greene, was, despite her raffish father, very much part of establishment Melbourne by the time of Rupert’s birth there in 1931.
Anna’s father, Jakob Torv, had been a farm boy in Parnu, Estonia, who later worked as a village tailor. Between the German and Russian invasions, he boarded a ship, as a junior engineer, to Scotland, where he found work in a tailor’s shop in Glasgow and anglicised his name to Jacob Torv. Soon, he fell in love with and married Sylvia Braida, the shop owner’s daughter. Both became dry cleaners. Anna, the eldest of four children, was born in Glasgow in 1944.
When Anna was nine, the family immigrated to Australia and settled in Blacktown. They ran a restaurant in a picnic park in Sydney’s west. It failed, and Jacob was bankrupted. It proved too much for Sylvia, and she deserted the family. Anna essentially took over as mother of her three siblings, but she benefited from a good Catholic education at the hands of Our Lady of Mercy College in Parramatta.
Anna wanted to be an actor (that would fall to her niece and namesake) but took a job as a telephonist and filing clerk at the Cremation Society of NSW. One day, she took the train into town, seeking a position with a newspaper. With no connections, she had no luck, but after attending a Ban the Bomb rally and writing up a piece, the news editor of The Daily Mirror was so impressed he gave her a cadetship. Her first story with a byline was about a woman who grew a huge sunflower in a jam jar.
Among her mentors at the Mirror was Blanche d’Alpuget, who introduced her to rich yachtsmen, and also to a senior Murdoch colleague and mentor, Douglas Brass, who introduced Anna to Rupert in 1964.
According to the Herald’s Valerie Lawson and Jane Freeman, Anna, by then a girl-around-town living in Blues Point Tower, was sent to interview Rupert for the Mirror’s in-house magazine. He told her he was attracted to her mind; she later said she was struck by his beautiful eyes – “lovely brown, mischievous eyes”.
They began a relationship and, at his behest, she moved to Canberra to become a reporter at The Australian. He was still married to his first wife, Adelaidean Patricia Booker, a former flight attendant and sales assistant at Myer. As with Rupert’s next three marriages, the couple had apparently grown apart. They were already living separate lives, although they had a daughter, Prudence, born in 1958.
After his divorce, Rupert and Anna married in April 1967. None of Rupert’s five wives were in his mother’s mould or from her milieu, but Dame Elisabeth loved and admired Anna.
In 1969, Rupert acquired News of the World and for the first of many times, they had to move. As Anna recalled, “I had never had a house and all these pretty things”. With Elisabeth, born in 1968 and named after her grandmother, they settled in Wimbledon.
An appalling tragedy not long after their arrival forever soured Anna’s view of London. On the evening of December 29, 1969, a gang calling itself “Mafia, Group 3, from America” kidnapped Muriel McKay, wife of Alick, acting chair of News of the World, mistaking her for Anna, who was on holiday in Australia. A ransom was never paid, and her body was never found. Two Trinidadian brothers, Arthur and Nizamodeen Hosein, were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for Muriel’s murder.
The family’s move – now with two sons, Lachlan and James – to New York after Rupert’s purchase of the city’s supermarket weekly The New York Star came as a relief for Anna. She must have tired, too, of being the wife of “the Dirty Digger”.
In New York, Anna was busy with the children, but Rupert had enough time to meet her after work at the office and for them to dine together. These were joyful years. About this time, Prudence, unhappy with her new stepfather, sought her father’s custody, and Anna took her mother’s place.
Once James began school, Anna too took to study, and over nine years earned a bachelor’s degree at Fordham, and a master’s in English and mythology at New York University. Her next goal was to write a book by the time she was 40.
In 1985, In Her Own Image was published. Set in the early ’60s at Tiddalik, a version of the Murdoch property, Cavan, near Yass, The Canberra Times saw it as a superior Thorn Birds: “No great literary masterpiece, but it is a competent professional story and much better than the average first novel.”
No Succession parallels can be drawn. It was the story of a vindicative, menopausal matriarch and her two daughters in love with the same man. “The overall effect is that of the realistic pastoral romances popular in Australia during the 1920s and 1930s.”
The New York Times wrote of a “tendency toward unrelieved earnestness; humour is in shorter supply here than water during the Australian outback’s driest month, December” but “among the many forms of love she portrays, the most compelling proves to be her own for the Australian outback, whose savage beauty she celebrates”.
Two more novels followed. Family Business (1988) and Coming to Terms (1991). The second was the tale of Yarrow Maclean, a newspaper proprietor who builds a Murdochian empire, and her rival and lover, Elliot Weyden, a businessman who runs for president and dies in the final pages.
Interestingly, Rupert had recently appointed Anna to the main board of News. It was thought she could act as regent if Rupert died early. He took little interest in Anna’s fiction. She wasn’t even sure he had read all of Family Business.
Coming to Terms, set in Poughkeepsie in the Hudson Valley and featuring a dying 77-year-old, The New York Times saw as a tale “that’s short on texture and believability” with “no tricky undercurrents, no threatening breakers or frenzied foam, just gently rolling affirmations and happy endings”.
But what was important to Anna was the fact that she had “stood up for herself”. As she told the Chicago Tribune’s Connie Lauerman in 1986: “I adore him, but there are some things that I like about it in my way. Writing the book and going back to college were my way of subtly doing this.”
In March 1991, the couple left New York for Los Angeles where, as Mark Lawson put it, Anna had a garden and Rupert had Twentieth Century Fox. Anna was 47, with a cool blonde Hitchcockian beauty that she never lost while “a Scottish precision of delivery survives within an accent moulded by the Australia of her teens, the London of her 20s and the America of her 30s”.
One of Rupert’s editors, Harold Evans, wrote of her “slim crystalline beauty … She was talkative, vivacious and open, whereas he was apparently crippled by shyness. He shuffled, smiled and left sentences in midair … she was warm and animated, and she entertained us with poise”.
As the years rolled on and Rupert became the mogul he always wanted to be, she wished he would slow down and that “we could have more time together”. This was never to be. Another tension was the rivalry fostered and festering between Elisabeth, Lachlan and James over the succession, which horrified their mother.
In 1998, Rupert, along with Roy Disney and Bob Hope, were made knights of the Order of St Gregory the Great, on the recommendation of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, for their contributions and their unblemished characters. Their three long-suffering wives were made dames of the order.
With their three children in London, New York and Sydney, the nest was empty. Rupert was romancing China and, it soon became apparent, his translator, Wendi Deng.
Their separation was announced in April 1998 and divorce followed in 1999. Anna was forced to resign from the News board in October. Seventeen days after the divorce, Rupert married Deng.
Anna did not speak publicly until February 2000, and then in a measured but still surprisingly frank interview with David Leser for The Australian Women’s Weekly. She said: “I thought we had a wonderful, happy marriage. Obviously, we didn’t. I don’t want to get too personal about this … but [he] was extremely hard, ruthless and determined that he was going to go through with this, no matter what I wanted or what I was trying to do to save the marriage. He had no interest in that whatsoever.”
She denied any bitterness and made it clear that she did not want to distress her children, settling for a fraction of what Californian law might have allowed, to preserve her children’s share and to ensure their control of the family trust.
By then, Anna had wed financier William Mann, a Catholic widower, in St Patrick’s Cathedral, New York in December 1999, which, given it was six months after her divorce, indicated that she had either been swiftly granted an annulment or her long marriage to Rupert had never been regularised by the Church.
Rupert, five years younger, referred to William as “a nice old man”. The couple lived in the Hamptons in a house once owned by the sister of the Aga Khan. Mann died in 2017.
Two years later, Anna married Palm Beach property developer Ashton dePeyster III, a descendant of a 17th century mayor of New York. They settled in Florida.
In September 2023, Rupert anointed Lachlan as his successor and, three months later, launched a legal battle in Nevada to amend the trust that Anna intended would leave all four eldest children in control.
Rupert wanted Lachlan to inherit control of News Ltd, ensuring it retained its conservative philosophy and its profitability so that all four children would benefit; this initiative was codenamed Project Family Harmony.
Prudence, James and Elisabeth (described in their father’s papers as “the objecting children”) challenged the move. Dissention among her children was the very thing their mother wanted to prevent. The decision of the Nevada commissioner, exactly a year later, upheld the four children’s objections.
Ultimately, the family settled so that Anna lived to see Lachlan would inherit the empire, while Prudence, James and Elisabeth forfeited their rights to choose a successor, each receiving $US1.1 billion ($1.5 billion).
During her lifetime she devoted her time, energy and experience to causes benefiting children, playing leading roles at Los Angeles Children’s Hospital and Haiti’s Hospital Albert Schweitzer.
Anna Murdoch Mann dePeyster is survived by her third husband and her three children, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

Cuba's health care system pushed to the brink by US fuel blockade, Cuban minister says

Cuba's health care system pushed to the brink by US fuel blockade, Cuban minister says
Cuban officials say a U.S. fuel blockade is pushing Cuba’s health system toward collapse and putting lives at risk
- Bookmark
Cuba’s debilitated health care system has been pushed to the brink of collapse by the U.S. blockading the country’s oil supply, a Cuban official said Friday.
The country’s medical system was already perpetually crisis-stricken along with the island’s economy, with lack of supplies, staff and medicine long being the norm. But the turmoil has reached a new extreme in recent weeks. Ambulances are struggling to find fuel to respond to emergencies. Persistent outages have plagued deteriorated hospitals. Flights bringing vital supplies have been suspended as Cuba’s government says it’s now unable to refuel airplanes in its airports.
Experts and some leaders of other countries have warned that the island could be on the verge of a humanitarian crisis.
In an interview with The Associated Press, Cuba’s Health Minister José Ángel Portal Miranda said that U.S. sanctions are no longer just crippling the island's economy, they're threatening “basic human safety.”
“You cannot damage a state’s economy without affecting its inhabitants,” Portal said. “This situation could put lives at risk.”
According to Portal, 5 million people in Cuba living with chronic illnesses will see their medications or treatments affected. This includes 16,000 cancer patients requiring radiotherapy and another 12,400 undergoing chemotherapy.
Cardiovascular care, orthopedics, oncology and treatment for critically ill patients who require electrical backup are among the most impacted areas, he said. Kidney disease treatments and emergency ambulance services have also been added to the list of impacted services.
The energy crisis Cuba has been grappling with for years entered new extremes last month when U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that would impose a tariff on any country that sells or provides oil to Cuba. It came just weeks after Trump deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and announced no more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba.
Cuba, which produces only 40% of its own fuel and largely depends on oil to power the island, has long relied on allies like Venezuela, Mexico and Russia to fill its energy deficit. But those shipments have now dried up.
Trump has openly said that his larger hope is to push regime change in Cuba by intensifying economic pressure on the island, which has already struggled to cope with decades of U.S. sanctions.
Cuban people — who the U.S. government has said it seeks to defend — are the ones feeling the harsh ripple effects of the U.S. fuel blockade as hardship mounts every day. Buses have slashed routes, gas has been put under strict rationing and is only being sold in foreign currency, and endemic blackouts have reached a new extreme.
“There’s been a drastic change since January,” said Aniliet Rodríguez, a 25-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted that month to a maternal care center for an extreme case of anemia. “There’s no bread, no milk for nutrition … . There are no medicines.”
Cuba's health care system follows a universal and free model, providing local clinics on nearly every block and state subsidized medicine. But it's also entered a state of crisis in recent years, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands of doctors being paid state wages that can hardly afford them a carton of eggs have emigrated from the country and hospitals have rapidly deteriorated.
Medicine shortages have forced many to buy them on the black market instead.
Such problems are expected to worsen in the coming weeks even though Cuba's government has struggled to adjust to the new reality, Portal said. Solar panels have been installed in clinics while authorities prioritize care to children and the elderly.
But he also said they have placed restrictions on some more energy-reliant technologies like CT scans and laboratory tests, noting doctors will have to rely on more basic methods to treat patients, effectively cutting many off from high levels of care.
"We are facing an energy siege with direct implications for the lives of Cubans, for the lives of Cuban families," Portal said.

US audit finds gaps in the FAA's oversight of United Airlines maintenance
A federal government audit says FAA staffing shortages and high employee turnover have hindered the agency's oversight of airplane maintenance at United Airlines
- Bookmark
The ability of federal safety regulators to oversee airplane maintenance at United Airlines has been hindered by inadequate staffing, high employee turnover and the improper use of virtual inspections instead of on-site reviews in some cases, according to a government watchdog audit released Friday.
The U.S. Transportation Department's inspector general said the Federal Aviation Administration lacks sufficient staffing and workforce planning to effectively monitor United’s large fleet. Past audits by the government watchdog also highlighted FAA challenges overseeing other airline maintenance programs, including at American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Allegiant Air.
The FAA declined to comment on the findings but referred The Associated Press to a letter it sent the inspector general's office that was included in the audit report. In it, the FAA said it agreed with most of the recommendations and was taking steps to address them by the end of the year.
“FAA will implement a more systemic approach to strengthen inspector capacity and will take other measures to ensure that staffing levels remain sufficient to meet surveillance requirements,” the letter said.
The recommendations included a reevaluation of staffing rules, an independent workplace survey of inspector workloads and office culture, and improved training on accessing and using United's safety data — a current gap that the report said currently keeps inspectors from fully evaluating maintenance issues and safety risk trends.
In a statement to AP, United said it works closely with the FAA on a daily basis in addition to employing its own internal safety management system.
“United has long advocated in favor of providing the FAA with the resources it needs for its important work," the carrier said.
The inspector general's office said the audit was conducted between May 2024 and December 2025, amid a series of maintenance-linked incidents at United.
It found that the FAA sometimes had its personnel conduct inspections “virtually” when it lacked staffing or funding for travel even though agency policy requires postponing reviews that can't be done on site. Doing the work remotely can create safety risks because inspectors may miss or misidentify maintenance problems, the reported stated.
“Inspectors we spoke with stated that their front-line managers instructed them to perform inspections virtually rather than postponing inspections,” the report said.
The audit also found that ongoing staffing shortages at the FAA inspection offices tasked with United's oversight have resulted in fewer inspections being conducted, limited surveillance of the carrier's maintenance operations and an “overall loss of institutional knowledge.”
In March 2024, passengers had to be evacuated from a United plane that rolled off a runway after landing in Houston. The next day, a United jetliner bound for Japan lost a tire while taking off from San Francisco but later landed safely in Los Angeles.
In December 2025, a United flight experienced an engine failure during takeoff from Dulles International Airport before safely returning to the airport.

Father murdered by teenagers in ‘unprovoked’ racist attack after dropping groceries at his mother’s house
Marcus Staniforth, 17, and a 16-year-old boy who cannot be named for legal reasons, were sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court
- Bookmark
Two teenage boys have been sentenced following the murder of a father who was fatally stabbed in the heart during an unprovoked racist attack.
Marcus Staniforth, 17, and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, approached Kamran Aman, 38, after he had delivered groceries to his mother’s home in Barry, south Wales.
The pair, from Llantwit Major, subjected Mr Aman to a brutal assault, punching and kicking him.
During and after the attack, the younger boy was heard shouting racist abuse.
Staniforth then retrieved a kitchen knife from a nearby property, where the teenagers had been consuming alcohol, and used it to inflict the fatal wound to Mr Aman’s heart.
Emergency services were called to the scene, but Mr Aman, a married man with a young child, was pronounced dead at 1.07am on 1 July last year.
Mr Justice Griffiths told Cardiff Crown Court that he had lifted reporting restrictions relating to Staniforth, meaning he can now be identified, but added that those relating to the 16-year-old boy would remain in place.
The judge sentenced both defendants to detention during His Majesty’s Pleasure, with Staniforth to serve a minimum of 17 years in custody and the 16-year-old boy to serve a minimum of 15 years.
He said: “On the night between June 30 and July 1 2025, you both murdered a man you didn’t know.
“Kamran Aman was a dutiful family man.
“He had just delivered some shopping to his mother’s house.
“He was in his car, ready to go back to his partner and four-year-old child when you picked on him and killed him in the street.
“As well as ending his life, you ruined the lives of the family he left behind.”
Mr Justice Griffiths described how earlier that day, the 16-year-old had painted “where they n****** at” on the wall of a house where he had been.
The boy, who had taken cocaine, later spotted Mr Aman through a window as he sat in his car.
“He noticed he was not white,” the judge said.
“Mr Aman caught his eye because he was black.”
The 16-year-old boy then tried to open Mr Aman’s car door, with Mr Aman getting out of the vehicle before being punched.
“He wanted to hurt him really badly because he was not white – that was his only reason,” the judge said.
“He was shouting racist abuse at him, calling him n-word and p-word, over and over again.”
The judge added that Staniforth was “not racist but he was violent” and wanted to back the 16-year-old in the attack.
Sentencing the 16-year-old, the judge told him: “You instigated a deliberate, unprovoked, sustained, violent, racist attack.
“You were old enough and mature enough to know that trying to cause a complete stranger really serious injury because of his race was wrong, and you knew exactly what you were doing.”
Prosecuting, Owen Edwards KC told the court that Mr Aman was stabbed while outside his mother’s house in an “entirely unprovoked attack”.
He said the defendants had been drinking alcohol on June 30, with the 16-year-old behaving in a “volatile and aggressive manner” throughout the evening.
Mr Aman had been working then saw his wife and young child before taking shopping to his mother, Shenaz Aman, on the night of June 30.
The 16-year-old boy noticed Mr Aman sitting in his car and “lost his temper”, with Staniforth telling him he would “back him up”, Mr Edwards said.
“Both young men entered the street and the 16-year-old launched a sustained assault against Kamran, consisting of repeated punches,” he told the court.
“Marcus joined in a limited extent, with punches and one hard kick.”
Mr Edwards said Staniforth then returned to a nearby property before emerging with a large kitchen knife, which he used to stab Mr Aman.
The 16-year-old boy used racist slurs against Mr Aman, calling him the p-word and n-word repeatedly during and after the attack, Mr Edwards added.
Both were arrested and later admitted manslaughter.
They were convicted of murder following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court.
During the hearing on Friday, the court was told that both defendants had troubled childhoods and had been diagnosed with ADHD.
In a victim personal statement, Mr Aman’s mother told how she had been left “upset and lonely” by her son’s murder.
His wife, Khaleela, described her husband as “kind to everyone and someone you could rely on in times of need” and devoted to his family.
“Life for us will never be the same without Kamran,” she told the court.
“There’s a hole in our hearts that can never be filled.
“The day he died, part of us died with him.
“There’s no sentence that will ever be enough for these two boys.”
Detective Inspector Kath Barry, from South Wales Police, paid tribute to Mr Aman’s family, saying: “Kamran did nothing whatsoever to warrant this.
“The violence could never have been foreseen and was made even more shocking by the abhorrent racist abuse used before, during and after, all captured on video footage.
“Within a matter of minutes, the lives of Kamran’s family changed forever, and they are still trying to comprehend how this could possibly have happened, particularly outside the house they have called home for almost 20 years.
“They have behaved with dignity and remarkable composure during the proceedings, despite having to listen to the unbearable details of his death.”

US thanks Kosovo for contribution to International Stabilization Force in Gaza
Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets Kosovo’s President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu in Washington
WASHINGTON
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday commended Kosovo's support for the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in the Gaza Strip.
After meeting with Kosovo’s President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, Rubio said he thanked her and her people for their commitment to peace and stability by being a founding member of the Board of Peace.
"I also thanked President Osmani for her contributions to the International Stabilization Force in Gaza," Rubio wrote on US social media company X.
Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, the commander of the ISF, announced Thursday that five countries committed troops to serve in the nascent security body.
Speaking at the Board of Peace's inaugural meeting in Washington, DC, Jeffers said Indonesia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Kosovo and Albania pledged troops, while Egypt and Jordan would train police forces.

Hamas says open to Gaza peacekeeping force, but rejects foreign role in ‘internal affairs’

Hamas says open to Gaza peacekeeping force, but rejects foreign role in ‘internal affairs’
After initially coming out strongly against US-backed stabilization force, terror group says ceasefire monitors acceptable while demanding halt to Israeli ‘aggression’ before ‘political process’
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Friday that his terror organization is open to international peacekeeping forces in Gaza, but rejected any interference in the territory’s “internal affairs.”
“Our position on international forces is clear: we want peacekeeping forces that monitor the ceasefire, ensure its implementation, and act as a buffer between the occupation army and our people in the Gaza Strip, without interfering in Gaza’s internal affairs,” Qassem told AFP.
Hamas had initially come out fervently against the International Stabilization Force when it was initially laid out last year by the US in its 20-point plan for ending the Gaza war. The terrorist group appears to be softening its stance now that the ISF is coming together and several countries have agreed to contribute troops to the force.
Hamas said in a statement late Thursday that any discussions on Gaza must begin with a total halt to Israeli “aggression” as US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” maps out the territory’s future, with Israel insisting on the terrorists’ disarmament before reconstruction starts.
Trump’s board met for its inaugural session in Washington on Thursday, with a number of countries pledging money and personnel for rebuilding, more than four months into a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
He revealed that five countries — Indonesia, Morocco, Albania, Kosovo and Kazakhstan — agreed to contribute thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force, which is supposed to gradually replace Israeli troops in Gaza.
But the board meeting offered no timeline for Hamas to lay down its weapons or for Israel’s army to withdraw from the shattered enclave.
“Any political process or any arrangement under discussion concerning the Gaza Strip and the future of our Palestinian people must start with the total halt of aggression,” Hamas said.
The terror group also said arrangements for Gaza’s future must start with the “lifting of the blockade, and the guarantee of our people’s legitimate national rights, first and foremost their right to freedom and self-determination.”
‘Security and peace’
The Board of Peace was established after the Trump administration, with longtime mediators Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
The next phase of the Trump plan provides for the disarmament of Hamas, the gradual withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces, and the deployment of the ISF, with a transitional Palestinian technocratic committee overseeing day-to-day governance.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that Hamas must disarm before any reconstruction begins, which the terror group has rejected.
Both sides have frequently accused each other of violating the terms of the ceasefire, which came into effect last October after two years of devastating war started by the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
At the Board of Peace meeting on Thursday, Trump said several countries, mostly in the Gulf, had pledged more than seven billion dollars to rebuild the territory.
Palestinians who spoke to AFP in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis swayed between hope and suspicion about the Washington meeting.
“Trump is merely a military force imposing his views on the world, and this security council, which he boasts about, is another gateway to the occupation of Palestine, another face of the Zionist occupation,” said Farid Abu Odeh, referring to the board.
Another Palestinian, Mohammed al-Saqqa, said he was praying Trump’s board would lead to “security and peace, and to something better than what we have gone through.”
Many analysts and some US allies have indicated skepticism about the board due to concerns it may sideline the United Nations.
Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told AFP he found what was emerging from the board “seriously disturbing.”
Lovatt said many of its ideas for Gaza’s reconstruction originated from Israeli-friendly partners, while Palestinian voices were excluded.
He asserted that signs pointed to “a colonial project in terms of trying to impose a foreign economic project on a territory.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the European Commission should not have sent a representative to the meeting as it did not have a mandate to represent member states.
Former US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro said the lack of Palestinian input and the grand reconstruction plans contingent on Hamas’s disarmament made it “hard to take the Board of Peace seriously.”

Olympic gold medalist Alysa Liu's advice for aspiring figure skaters

Olympic gold medalist Alysa Liu has advice for aspiring figure skaters: "Don't try to be the next me"
Milan, Italy — U.S. figure skater Alysa Liu smiled as she recalled the "so hype" crowd Thursday after winning Olympic gold in the women's singles event — a first for Team USA since 2002.
"Just the energy in the arena. That's why I skate," Liu told "CBS Saturday Morning" co-host Kelly O'Grady in Milan, Italy, on Friday.
The 20-year-old skater said she doesn't feel nervous when she slides onto the ice; instead, she focuses on the joy the sport brings her. To "protect [her] peace," she surrounds herself with friends who keep her grounded. She says she has also learned to say no when necessary.
Liu acknowledges that becoming an Olympic athlete requires a balance of hard work, dedication, and a genuine love for the sport.
"I love working hard and pushing myself to the limit, but to do that, I need rest," Liu said, emphasizing the importance of recognizing when to prioritize recovery.
She made history as the youngest U.S. women's champion at 13, then stunned the skating world by retiring at 16 following her 2022 Olympic debut in Beijing, where she placed sixth. But two years later, she got the itch to return to the ice.
"I wasn't planning to return to competition at this point," she told "60 Minutes" in January. "I just wanted quick hits of dopamine, basically."
In June 2024, Liu started training again full time with coaches Massimo Scali and Phillip DiGuglielmo. Her comeback wasn't about the hardware, but about the journey.
"I hope [my story is] inspiring, and I hope it allows for others to...break through more," Liu said, adding that she also wants her program and personal style to be remembered.
For skaters aspiring to be "the next Alysa," Liu has advice: "Don't try to be the next me."
While she hopes she inspires other athletes to pursue their passions, she wants to remind everyone to be their authentic selves.
"At the end of the day, take some time for yourself. Spend time alone. I think it really helped me," she advised.
As for advice for her younger self, Liu said she wouldn't tell her a thing.
"She's going to figure it out herself. I don't want to change anything," Liu said.

Brazilian President Lula says Maduro should face justice in Venezuela
Lula says national sovereignty must override foreign intervention following unprecedented abduction of Venezuelan leader by US
BOGOTA, Colombia
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took a diplomatic stance Friday on the detention of Nicolas Maduro, asserting that the Venezuelan leader must face legal accountability within his own borders rather than in a foreign courtroom.
The comments at the Artificial Intelligence Summit in India follow the abduction of Maduro in Caracas by the US on Jan. 3.
"I am of the firm belief that if Nicolás Maduro is to stand trial, he should be tried in Venezuela, not abroad," Lula told India Today TV, emphasizing a commitment to national jurisdiction over international intervention.
Lula said the ultimate objective remains the "restoration of democracy in Venezuela," but the methods used to achieve it must respect the fundamental principles of national sovereignty.
He argued that the international community cannot set a precedent where a sitting head of state is forcibly captured by another nation. He drew a parallel to legal disputes involving Brazilian citizens in the US, maintaining his long-standing position that individuals should be prosecuted in their home countries according to their own constitutional frameworks.
Venezuela is undergoing radical structural reforms under the direct tutelage of the Trump administration, with Delcy Rodríguez serving as interim president. On Thursday, the Venezuelan Congress unanimously passed a sweeping amnesty law, marking a significant legislative shift.
But Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, remain in preventive detention on US soil. The US justice system has leveled grave allegations against the couple, linking them to international cocaine trafficking operations.
Lula’s comments come at a delicate moment in Brazil-US relations. Lula is working to finalize a meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington, tentatively scheduled for March.
Beyond the Venezuelan crisis, Lula’s agenda is focused on repealing the burdensome extra tariffs that continue to stifle trade between the two largest economies in the Americas.

Tributes paid to teen couple found dead after suspected carbon monoxide poisoning
Two men aged 33 and 42 have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter over their deaths
- Bookmark
A teenage couple who died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning at a Yorkshire holiday park have been named.
Cherish Bean, 15, and Ethan Slater, 17, were discovered at a rental property at Little Eden Holiday Park in Bridlington on Wednesday.
A 42-year-old man became the second person arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter over their deaths, Humberside Police said.
An extension has been granted in relation to a 33-year-old man who was arrested on Thursday, allowing police to detain him for a further 12 hours.
Chief Superintendent Matt Peach, Northbank Divisional Commander, said: “Our thoughts remain with the loved ones of both teenagers, who have been named by their families as 15-year-old Cherish Bean, and 17-year-old Ethan Slater, who tragically lost their lives.
“Specialist trained officers are providing ongoing support through this incredibly distressing time and I would ask again for people to refrain from speculation in respect of their privacy.
“Since we received the call of concern for safety on Wednesday morning, a dedicated team of detectives and specialist officers have continued to carry out detailed inquiries to establish the full circumstances surrounding the deaths, which are thought to be connected to carbon monoxide poisoning.
“The cordon remains in place at Little Eden Holiday Park and we continue to work in co-ordination with the Health and Safety Executive alongside our partners from Humberside Fire & Rescue, and East Riding of Yorkshire Council.”
An online fundraising page set up for Ethan’s family has raised more than £16,000 in two days.
The page says: “It is with unimaginable heartbreak that I write this. Our son Ethan tragically and unexpectedly passed away at just 17 years old, alongside his beautiful girlfriend.
“No parent should ever have to write these words. No family should ever have to face this pain.
“Ethan had his whole life ahead of him. He’ll never get to pass his driving test. He’ll never celebrate his 18th birthday. He’ll never reach the milestones we all assumed were waiting for him.
“He was just beginning his journey into adulthood, full of plans, laughter, and a future that was taken far too soon.
“He was the most kind hearted boy. With a natural warmth. He was funny, he was protective and he carried himself with a quiet strength and loyalty that made us so proud to call him our son.
“He was loved beyond measure. A son, a brother, a grandson, a friend. His smile lit up a room, and his absence has left a silence that feels impossible to fill. Our lives will never be the same without him.”

Who's weighing in as Trump considers military strikes on Iran?
At the same time the U.S. has entered negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program, President Trump acknowledged he's considering limited military strikes against the regime, and inside the Trump administration, there are factions weighing in with the president on each option.
A Trump ally, who requested anonymity to talk about private discussions, described the internal deliberations inside the administration as "less of a debate" or ideological standoff on foreign policy and more of a "series of updates" for Mr. Trump, who is reacting to each briefing and development and considering his options, with few sure about which direction he might go, since events and information remain fluid.
The ally referred to the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a "point person" in helping Mr. Trump develop the contours of a potential diplomatic deal, along with top officials, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio, should there be a military strike that takes place in the coming days or weeks.
Top national security officials have told Mr. Trump the military would be ready for potential strikes on Iran as soon as Saturday, though the timeline for any action is likely to extend beyond this weekend. The president has not yet made a final decision about whether to strike, officials said.
Publicly, Rubio has focused on diplomatic efforts and said a few days ago that that's where the president's focus was, too.
"Right now, we are talking about negotiations; we are focused on negotiations," he said in Slovakia on Feb. 15. "The president has made that clear. If that changes, it will be obvious to everyone."
Rubio has presented both sides of the argument to Mr. Trump, multiple sources familiar with the discussions say, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has laid out U.S. military options and the timeline when the military assets would be ready. All military forces deployed to the region are expected to be in place by mid-March.
In private meetings, Vice President JD Vance has weighed in, too, and said his preference is to not launch military strikes against Iran, according to multiple sources.
A White House official said the vice president "provides a multitude of different angles and scenarios in order for the president to make informed decisions about a wide range of issues."
And the official said the president "listens to a range of opinions on any given issue, but ultimately decides based on what is best for our country and national security."
"It's not clear to me that he's made up his mind about what his objectives are," former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, now a Trump critic, said in an interview. "I believe ultimately there will be a use of military force because he has to vindicate the red line he drew back during the protests."
The U.S. and Iran concluded a round of negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva, with both sides saying progress was made, but there are "still a lot of details to discuss," a U.S. official said. Iran is expected to present detailed proposals within a couple of weeks "to address some of the open gaps in our positions," the official also said. No date has been set for follow-up consultations.
Last June, the U.S. joined Israel in strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities during its 12-day war with Iran, causing what intelligence suggested was severe damage to the regime's nuclear program.
There has been some activity around the nuclear sites recently. Satellite photos from late January showed roofs have been built over two damaged buildings at the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities, the first major activity detected by satellite at any of the country's stricken nuclear sites since the 12-day war.

Supreme Court strikes down Trump tariffs, rebuking president's signature economic policy

The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a huge chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy.
The law that undergirds those import duties "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs," the majority ruled 6-3 in the long-awaited decision.
The ruling is a massive loss for Trump, who has made tariffs — and his asserted power to impose them on any country at any time, without congressional input — a central feature of his second presidential term.
Trump's legal stance "would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy," the majority concluded. And they highlighted that Trump imposed the tariffs without Congress, which has the power to tax under the Constitution.
Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.
The decision noted that before Trump, no president had ever used the statute in question "to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope."
To justify the "extraordinary" tariff powers, Trump must "point to clear congressional authorization," the court wrote. "He cannot."
The ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded. That sum could total $175 billion, according to a new estimate from the Penn Wharton Budget Model.
Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent that the refund process "is likely to be a 'mess,'" after predicting that the short-term impact of the court's tariff ruling "could be substantial."
Betting it all on IEEPA
Since retaking the White House, Trump has rapidly reshaped America's long-standing trade relationships by imposing a staggering array of import duties that have touched nearly every country on earth.
Many of those tariffs were invoked using a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. They include Trump's near-global "reciprocal" tariffs, and separate duties related to the alleged trafficking of deadly drugs into the U.S.
The IEEPA does not explicitly mention tariffs, as the Supreme Court noted Friday. Instead, it allows the president to "regulate … importation" of foreign property transactions after declaring a national emergency in order to deal with certain "unusual and extraordinary" threats.
The Trump administration has argued that language empowers the president to impose tariffs on foreign goods.
Critics charged that the law does not permit the president to unilaterally impose levies of any size on any country at any time. A federal trade court and a federal appeals court both found Trump's IEEPA tariffs illegal before the Supreme Court took up the case.
The majority of U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.
Trump critics — and businesses — rejoice
Reaction to the ruling quickly poured in, with the loudest voices cheering the demise of the chaotic policy that has been blamed for raising prices and straining long-standing global alliances.
"This ruling is a victory for every American family paying higher prices because of Trump's tariff taxes," Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the House Budget Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. "The Supreme Court rejected Trump's attempt to impose what amounted to a national sales tax on hardworking Americans."
House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass., in a statement called the decision "a victory for the American people, the rule of law, and our standing in the global economy."
Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a U.S. sneaker industry group, said Friday's ruling "marks an important step toward creating a more predictable and competitive environment for American businesses and consumers."
"This ruling provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant," Matt Priest, president and CEO of the footwear group, said in a statement.
The Distilled Spirits Council, an advocacy group for U.S. liquor makers, responded to the ruling by urging the Trump administration to "secure a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs" with top trade partners.
Doing so "would provide much needed certainty for American spirits exporters while helping ease financial pressures on bars, restaurants and retailers at a time when affordability remains a major concern for consumers," said the council's president and CEO, Chris Swonger, in a statement.
Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for trade with the U.S., said in a post on X that the decision "reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified."
Tariff tumult
Trump last April unveiled his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans at a much-ballyhooed White House event marking what he had dubbed America's "liberation day."
That announcement stoked a sudden market panic, and the tariffs were quickly put on pause. They have since been repeatedly tweaked, delayed and reimposed, adding confusion and further complexity to the administration's tangled web of trade policies.
Other IEEPA-based tariffs include a set aimed at Mexico, Canada and China related to allegations that those countries have allowed the deadly drug fentanyl to flow into the U.S.
Trump, a fierce critic of America's recent history of making free trade deals, has repeatedly praised tariffs as both a bountiful source of federal revenue and a key tool in negotiations with foreign partners and adversaries alike.
He has claimed foreign countries bear the cost of his tariffs, and he has downplayed concerns that the taxes lead to higher prices for Americans. His administration, however, has admitted that the duties are paid by U.S. importers.
Trump has claimed the tariff revenue has been so large that the duties may be able to replace the income tax. He has also floated the idea of sending Americans $2,000 tariff dividend checks.
"We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs," he wrote in a recent Truth Social post.
Other estimates are significantly lower: The Bipartisan Policy Center, for instance, tallied U.S. gross tariff revenue in 2025 at about $289 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had collected roughly $200 billion between Jan. 20 and Dec. 15.
For the IEEPA-specific tariffs, the administration said it has collected about $129 billion in revenue as of Dec. 10.
Ahead of the ruling, Trump and his administration talked up the consequences of the high court striking down the tariffs.
"If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED!" Trump wrote on Jan. 12.
U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have stated they believed the Supreme Court would not undo the president's "signature" economic policy.

Reeling From Tariff Ruling, Trump Lobs Insults at High Court
President Donald Trump took the Supreme Court’s tariffs ruling personally, and he made it personal in response.
The president made clear on Friday he did not appreciate that two of the justices he nominated sided against him on his signature economic policy — and did so in extraordinarily direct, personal terms.

U.S. Men’s Hockey Cruises to a Gold Medal Showdown With Rival Canada

Canada can have all the drama. The United States will take the deep semifinal exhale.
On the same day on which Canada’s men’s hockey team required a late comeback against Finland to reach the Olympic gold medal game in Milan, the United States took a far less stressful route to the 2026 Games final matchup so many hockey fans had hoped for. The U.S. cruised past Slovakia on Friday night, 6-2, and will face Canada in Sunday’s Olympic final.
Three days after the American women’s team beat Canada in a classic gold medal showdown, the North American men’s rivals will meet in the Olympic final for the first time in 16 years. On that Sunday when the teams last vied for gold in Vancouver, Sidney Crosby’s overtime score gave the host country a moment of national pride forever seared into its memory. (The Canadian women also triumphed, over the U.S., in the 2010 final).
More recently, many of the players suiting up on Sunday in Milan battled in another best-on-best, U.S.-Canada classic about a year ago, in the inaugural 4 Nations Face-Off in Boston. In that one, Connor McDavid’s sudden-death goal broke American hearts.
In these Olympics, Canada not only had to sweat out a 3-2 victory over Finland in the semis: in the quarterfinals, the team needed overtime to knock off Czechia. “Putting our country through it,” McDavid said after Friday’s victory over Finland. “A lot of stressful mornings for everyone at home but you know what, it’s been fun.” (Some hockey loyalists across the provinces might disagree). The U.S. and Sweden played a 3-on-3 extra session in the quarters too. Quinn Hughes’ ripper allowed the Americans to advance.
For the Americans, Friday was free from such nailbiting. Four minutes, 19 seconds into the first period, a Dylan Larkin goal gave the U.S. a very early 1-0 lead against the Slovakians, which have only seven NHL players on their roster. Some breathing room arrived later in the period. On a power play, Tage Thompson, of the Buffalo Sabres, took a point pass from Jack Eichel. Thompson smoked a shot from the wing, past the right shoulder of Slovakia keeper Samuel Hlavaj, a minor leaguer for the Minnesota Wild who, before this night, had mostly shined at this Olympic tournament.
The pile-on arrived in the second period. At a little more than halfway through, a sweet left-handed goal from Jack Hughes pushed the U.S. advantage to 3-0. Nineteen seconds later, Eichel, the Vegas Golden Knights center, got in on the scoring: his goal, which made it 4-0, was assisted by both Tkachuk brothers, Brady and Matthew. Hlavaj was sent to the bench, his evening done. About six minutes later, Hlavaj’s replacement, Stanislav Skorvanek, got a taste of American firepower, as Hughes scored another goal.
Slovakia got on the board in the final stanza; Juraj Slafkovsky of the Montreal Canadiens slipped a shot past American keeper Connor Hellebuyck to avoid a shutout. A Brady Tkachuk breakaway pushed the U.S. lead to 6-1; Slovakia responded with a Pavol Regenda goal.
So the stage is set for Sunday. Team USA and Canada in the gold medal final, to close out these Milano Cortina Olympic Games. The promise of one last thriller.
What more can you ask for?

US evacuates hundreds of troops from Qatar, Bahrain amid Iran tensions: Report
Reported pullout seen as precautionary ahead of possible US strikes on Iran, expected to trigger retaliation against American forces region-wide
ISTANBUL
Hundreds of US troops have been pulled out of the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, The New York Times reported Friday, citing anonymous Pentagon sources.
The report also said forces have been evacuated from Bahrain, where the US Navy’s 5th Fleet is based.
American forces remain stationed at bases in Iraq, Syria, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
The withdrawal is being interpreted as a precautionary measure amid rising tensions about a possible US. attack on Iran, with Tehran expected to respond by striking American forces in the region.
The US military’s Central Command, which covers Iran and much of the surrounding region, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a letter Thursday to the UN secretary-general, the head of Iran’s mission to the UN said if Iran were attacked, then “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets,” and the “United States would bear full and direct responsibility for any unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences.”
Al Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East, hosting 10,000 troops.

US envoy suggests it would be ‘fine’ if Israel expands across Middle East
‘It would be fine if they took it all,’ Mike Huckabee says when asked about expanding Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates.
Mike Huckabee, the United States ambassador to Israel, has suggested that he would not object if Israel were to take most of the Middle East, stressing what he described as the Jewish people’s right to the land.
In an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson that aired on Friday, Huckabee was pressed about the geographical borders of Israel, which he argues are rooted in the Bible.

Carlson told Huckabee that the biblical verse had promised the land to the descendants of Abraham, including the area between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile River in Egypt.
Such a swath would encompass modern-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and parts of Saudi Arabia.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year.
Carlson, who appeared taken aback by the statement, asked Huckabee if indeed he would approve of Israel expanding over the entire region.
“They don’t want to take it over. They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.
The US envoy, an avowed Christian Zionist and staunch defender of Israel, later appeared to walk back his assertion, saying that it “was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”.
Still, he left the door open for Israeli expansionism based on his religious interpretation.
“If they end up getting attacked by all these places, and they win that war, and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” Huckabee said.
The Department of State did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment on whether Secretary of State Marco Rubio shares Huckabee’s views on Israel’s right to expand.
The principle of territorial integrity and the prohibition against the acquisition of land by force have been a bedrock of international law since World War II.
In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must cease immediately.
But Israeli law does not clearly demarcate the country’s borders. Israel also occupies the Golan Heights in Syria, which it illegally annexed in 1981.
The US is the only country that recognises Israel’s claimed sovereignty over the Syrian territory.
After the 2024 war with Hezbollah, Israel also set up military outposts in five points inside Lebanon.
Some Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have openly promoted the idea of a “Greater Israel” with expanded borders.
Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stirred international outrage in 2023 when he spoke at an event featuring a map that included the Palestinian territories and portions of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan as part of Israel, set against the colours of the Israeli flag.
In his interview with Carlson, Huckabee tried to argue that Israel’s right to exist is rooted in international law, but he also attacked the legal institutions that oversee international law for their opposition to Israeli abuses.
“One of the reasons I’m so grateful President Trump and Secretary Rubio are pushing hard, trying to get rid of the ICC [International Criminal Court] and the ICJ is because they have become rogue organisations that are no longer really about an equal application of law,” he said.
Beyond his professed religious devotion to Israel, Huckabee has faced criticism for failing to speak up for the rights of US citizens who have been killed and imprisoned by Israeli forces during his ambassadorship.
Last year, Huckabee even sparked anger from some conservatives in the US when he met with convicted spy Jonathan Pollard, who sold US intelligence secrets to the Israeli government, details of which later made it to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.
Pollard, a former civilian analyst in the US Navy, served 30 years in jail and moved to Israel in 2020 after his release. He never expressed regret for his crimes, and in 2021, he called on Jewish employees in US security agencies to spy for Israel.
Huckabee said he does not agree with Pollard’s views, but he denied hosting him, arguing that he simply held a meeting with him at the US embassy in Jerusalem.
Asked if anyone can walk into the embassy to meet the envoy, Huckabee acknowledged that such a meeting requires a pre-approved appointment.
“He was able to come to the US embassy to have a meeting at his request. I did, and frankly, I don’t regret it,” Huckabee said.
“I met with a lot of people over the course of the time I’ve been here and will meet with a lot more.”
